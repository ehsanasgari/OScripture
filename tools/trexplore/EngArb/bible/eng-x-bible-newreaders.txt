40001001	This is a record of the family line of Jesus Christ . He is the son of David . He is also the son of Abraham .
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac . Isaac was the father of Jacob . Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers .
40001003	Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah . Tamar was their mother . Perez was the father of Hezron . Hezron was the father of Ram .
40001004	Ram was the father of Amminadab . Amminadab was the father of Nahshon . Nahshon was the father of Salmon .
40001005	Salmon was the father of Boaz . Rahab was Boaz's mother . Boaz was the father of Obed . Ruth was Obed's mother . Obed was the father of Jesse .
40001006	And Jesse was the father of King David . David was the father of Solomon . Solomon's mother had been Uriah's wife .
40001007	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam . Rehoboam was the father of Abijah . Abijah was the father of Asa .
40001008	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat . Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram . Jehoram was the father of Uzziah .
40001009	Uzziah was the father of Jotham . Jotham was the father of Ahaz . Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah .
40001010	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh . Manasseh was the father of Amon . Amon was the father of Josiah .
40001011	And Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers . At that time , the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon .
40001012	After this , the family line continued . Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel . Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel .
40001013	Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud . Abiud was the father of Eliakim . Eliakim was the father of Azor .
40001014	Azor was the father of Zadok . Zadok was the father of Akim . Akim was the father of Eliud .
40001015	Eliud was the father of Eleazar . Eleazar was the father of Matthan . Matthan was the father of Jacob .
40001016	Jacob was the father of Joseph . Joseph was the husband of Mary . And Mary gave birth to Jesus , who is called Christ .
40001017	So there were 14 generations from Abraham to David . There were 14 from David until the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon . And there were 14 from that time to the Christ .
40001018	This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about . His mother Mary and Joseph had promised to get married . But before they started to live together , it became clear that she was going to have a baby . She became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Her husband Joseph was a godly man . He did not want to put her to shame in public . So he planned to divorce her quietly .
40001020	But as Joseph was thinking about this , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream . The angel said , " Joseph , son of David , don't be afraid to take Mary home as your wife . The baby inside her is from the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She is going to have a son . You must give him the name Jesus . That is because he will save his people from their sins . "
40001022	All of this took place to bring about what the Lord had said would happen . He had said through the prophet ,
40001023	" The virgin is going to have a baby . She will give birth to a son . And he will be called Immanuel . " The name Immanuel means " God with us . "
40001024	Joseph woke up . He did what the angel of the Lord commanded him to do . He took Mary home as his wife .
40001025	But he did not make love to her until after she gave birth to a son . And Joseph gave him the name Jesus .
40002001	Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea . This happened while Herod was king of Judea . After Jesus' birth , Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem .
40002002	They asked , " Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews ? When we were in the east , we saw his star . Now we have come to worship him . "
40002003	When King Herod heard about it , he was very upset . Everyone in Jerusalem was troubled too .
40002004	So Herod called together all the chief priests of the people . He also called the teachers of the law . He asked them where the Christ was going to be born .
40002005	" In Bethlehem in Judea , " they replied . " This is what the prophet has written . He said ,
40002006	" ' But you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , are certainly not the least important among the towns of Judah . A ruler will come out of you . He will be the shepherd of my people Israel . ' "
40002007	Then Herod called for the Wise Men secretly . He found out from them exactly when the star had appeared .
40002008	He sent them to Bethlehem . He said , " Go ! Make a careful search for the child . As soon as you find him , bring me a report . Then I can go and worship him too . "
40002009	After the Wise Men had listened to the king , they went on their way . The star they had seen when they were in the east went ahead of them . It finally stopped over the place where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they were filled with joy .
40002011	The Wise Men went to the house . There they saw the child with his mother Mary . They bowed down and worshiped him . Then they opened their treasures . They gave him gold , incense and myrrh .
40002012	But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod . So they returned to their country on a different road .
40002013	When the Wise Men had left , Joseph had a dream . In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him . " Get up ! " the angel said . " Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt . Stay there until I tell you to come back . Herod is going to search for the child . He wants to kill him . "
40002014	Joseph got up . During the night , he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary .
40002015	They stayed there until King Herod died . So the words the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true . He had said , " I chose to bring my son out of Egypt . "
40002016	Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him . So he became very angry . He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the area around it . All the boys two years old and under were to be killed . This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star .
40002017	In this way , the words the prophet Jeremiah spoke came true . He had said ,
40002018	" A voice is heard in Ramah . It's the sound of crying and deep sadness . Rachel is crying over her children . She refuses to be comforted , because they are gone . "
40002019	After Herod died , Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt . In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him .
40002020	The angel said , " Get up ! Take the child and his mother . Go to the land of Israel . Those who were trying to kill the child are dead . "
40002021	So Joseph got up . He took the child and his mother Mary back to the land of Israel .
40002022	But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea . Archelaus was ruling in place of his father Herod . This made Joseph afraid to go there . Warned in a dream , Joseph went back to the land of Galilee instead .
40002023	There he lived in a town called Nazareth . So what the prophets had said about Jesus came true . They had said , " He will be called a Nazarene . "
40003001	In those days John the Baptist came and preached in the Desert of Judea .
40003002	He said , " Turn away from your sins ! The kingdom of heaven is near . "
40003003	John is the one the prophet Isaiah had spoken about . He had said , " A messenger is calling out in the desert , ' Prepare the way for the Lord . Make straight paths for him . ' "
40003004	John's clothes were made out of camel's hair . He had a leather belt around his waist . His food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	People went out to him from Jerusalem and all of Judea . They also came from the whole area around the Jordan River .
40003006	When they admitted they had sinned , John baptized them in the Jordan .
40003007	John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing . He said to them , " You are like a nest of poisonous snakes ! Who warned you to escape the coming of God's anger ?
40003008	Produce fruit that shows you have turned away from your sins .
40003009	Don't think you can say to yourselves , ' Abraham is our father . ' I tell you , God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones .
40003010	The ax is already lying at the roots of the trees . All the trees that don't produce good fruit will be cut down . They will be thrown into the fire .
40003011	" I baptize you with water , calling you to turn away from your sins . But after me , one will come who is more powerful than I am . And I'm not fit to carry his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
40003012	His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing floor . He will gather his wheat into the storeroom . But he will burn up the husks with fire that can't be put out . "
40003013	Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River . He wanted to be baptized by John .
40003014	But John tried to stop him . He told Jesus , " I need to be baptized by you . So why do you come to me ? "
40003015	Jesus replied , " Let it be this way for now . It is right for us to do this . It carries out God's holy plan . " Then John agreed .
40003016	As soon as Jesus was baptized , he came up out of the water . At that moment heaven was opened . Jesus saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove .
40003017	A voice from heaven said , " This is my Son , and I love him . I am very pleased with him . "
40004001	The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert . There the devil tempted him .
40004002	After 40 days and 40 nights of going without eating , Jesus was hungry .
40004003	The tempter came to him . He said , " If you are the Son of God , tell these stones to become bread . "
40004004	Jesus answered , " It is written , ' Man doesn't live only on bread . He also lives on every word that comes from the mouth of God . ' "
40004005	Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city . He had him stand on the highest point of the temple .
40004006	" If you are the Son of God , " he said , " throw yourself down . It is written , " ' The Lord will command his angels to take good care of you . They will lift you up in their hands . Then you won't trip over a stone . ' "
40004007	Jesus answered him , " It is also written , ' Do not put the Lord your God to the test . ' "
40004008	Finally , the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain . He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory .
40004009	" If you bow down and worship me , " he said , " I will give you all of this . "
40004010	Jesus said to him , " Get away from me , Satan ! It is written , ' Worship the Lord your God . He is the only one you should serve . ' "
40004011	Then the devil left Jesus . Angels came and took care of him .
40004012	John had been put in prison . When Jesus heard about this , he returned to Galilee .
40004013	Jesus left Nazareth . He went to live in the city of Capernaum . It was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40004014	In that way , what the prophet Isaiah had said came true . He had said ,
40004015	" Land of Zebulun ! Land of Naphtali ! Galilee , where non-Jewish people live ! Land along the Mediterranean Sea ! Territory east of the Jordan River !
40004016	The people who are now living in darkness will see a great light . They are now living in a very dark land . But a light will shine on them . "
40004017	From that time on Jesus began to preach . " Turn away from your sins ! " he said . " The kingdom of heaven is near . "
40004018	One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee . There he saw two brothers . They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew . They were throwing a net into the lake . They were fishermen .
40004019	" Come . Follow me , " Jesus said . " I will make you fishers of people . "
40004020	At once they left their nets and followed him .
40004021	Going on from there , he saw two other brothers . They were James , son of Zebedee , and his brother John . They were in a boat with their father Zebedee . As they were preparing their nets , Jesus called out to them .
40004022	Right away they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus .
40004023	Jesus went all over Galilee . There he taught in the synagogues . He preached the good news of God's kingdom . He healed every illness and sickness the people had .
40004024	News about him spread all over Syria . People brought to him all who were ill with different kinds of sicknesses . Some were suffering great pain . Others were controlled by demons . Some were shaking wildly . Others couldn't move at all . And Jesus healed all of them .
40004025	Large crowds followed him . Some people came from Galilee , from the area known as the Ten Cities , and from Jerusalem and Judea . Others came from the area across the Jordan River .
40005001	Jesus saw the crowds . So he went up on a mountainside and sat down . His disciples came to him .
40005002	Then he began to teach them . He said ,
40005003	" Blessed are those who are spiritually needy . The kingdom of heaven belongs to them .
40005004	Blessed are those who are sad . They will be comforted .
40005005	Blessed are those who are free of pride . They will be given the earth .
40005006	Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right . They will be filled .
40005007	Blessed are those who show mercy . They will be shown mercy .
40005008	Blessed are those whose hearts are pure . They will see God .
40005009	Blessed are those who make peace . They will be called sons of God .
40005010	Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right . The kingdom of heaven belongs to them .
40005011	" Blessed are you when people make fun of you and hurt you because of me . You are also blessed when they tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me .
40005012	Be joyful and glad . Your reward in heaven is great . In the same way , people hurt the prophets who lived long ago .
40005013	" You are the salt of the earth . But suppose the salt loses its saltiness . How can it be made salty again ? It is no longer good for anything . It will be thrown out . People will walk all over it .
40005014	" You are the light of the world . A city on a hill can't be hidden .
40005015	Also , people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl . Instead , they put it on its stand . Then it gives light to everyone in the house .
40005016	" In the same way , let your light shine in front of others . Then they will see the good things you do . And they will praise your Father who is in heaven .
40005017	" Do not think I have come to get rid of what is written in the Law or in the Prophets . I have not come to do that . Instead , I have come to give full meaning to what is written .
40005018	What I'm about to tell you is true . Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter disappears from the Law . Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the Law until everything is completed .
40005019	" Do not break even one of the least important commandments . And do not teach others to break them . If you do , you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven . Instead , practice and teach these commands . Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	" Here is what I tell you . You must be more godly than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law . If you are not , you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	" You have heard what was said to people who lived long ago . They were told , ' Do not commit murder . Anyone who murders will be judged for it . '
40005022	But here is what I tell you . Do not be angry with your brother . Anyone who is angry with his brother will be judged . Again , anyone who says to his brother , ' Raca , ' must stand trial in the Sanhedrin . But anyone who says , ' You fool ! ' will be in danger of the fire in hell .
40005023	" Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar . And you remember that your brother has something against you .
40005024	Leave your gift in front of the altar . First go and make peace with your brother . Then come back and offer your gift .
40005025	" Suppose someone has a claim against you and is taking you to court . Settle the matter quickly . Do it while you are still with him on your way . If you don't , he may hand you over to the judge . The judge may hand you over to the officer . And you may be thrown into prison .
40005026	What I'm about to tell you is true . You will not get out until you have paid the very last penny !
40005027	" You have heard that it was said , ' Do not commit adultery . '
40005028	But here is what I tell you . Do not even look at a woman in the wrong way . Anyone who does has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	" If your right eye causes you to sin , poke it out and throw it away . Your eye is only one part of your body . It is better to lose it than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .
40005030	" If your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . Your hand is only one part of your body . It is better to lose it than for your whole body to go into hell .
40005031	" It has been said , ' Suppose a man divorces his wife . If he does , he must give her a letter of divorce . '
40005032	But here is what I tell you . Anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery . And anyone who gets married to the divorced woman commits adultery . A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him .
40005033	" Again , you have heard what was said to your people long ago . They were told , ' Do not break the promises you make to the Lord . Keep the oaths you have made to him . '
40005034	But here is what I tell you . Do not make any promises like that at all . Do not make them in the name of heaven . That is God's throne .
40005035	Do not make them in the name of the earth . That is the stool for God's feet . Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem . That is the city of the Great King .
40005036	And do not take an oath in the name of your head . You can't make even one hair white or black .
40005037	" Just let your ' Yes' mean ' Yes . ' Let your ' No' mean ' No . ' Anything more than this comes from the evil one .
40005038	" You have heard that it was said , ' An eye must be put out for an eye . A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth . '
40005039	But here is what I tell you . Do not fight against an evil person . " Suppose someone hits you on your right cheek . Turn your other cheek to him also .
40005040	Suppose someone takes you to court to get your shirt . Let him have your coat also .
40005041	Suppose someone forces you to go one mile . Go two miles with him .
40005042	" Give to the one who asks you for something . Don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow something from you .
40005043	" You have heard that it was said , ' Love your neighbor . Hate your enemy . '
40005044	But here is what I tell you . Love your enemies . Pray for those who hurt you .
40005045	Then you will be sons of your Father who is in heaven . " He causes his sun to shine on evil people and good people . He sends rain on those who do right and those who don't .
40005046	" If you love those who love you , what reward will you get ? Even the tax collectors do that .
40005047	If you greet only your own people , what more are you doing than others ? Even people who are ungodly do that .
40005048	So be perfect , just as your Father in heaven is perfect .
40006001	" Be careful not to do ' good works' in front of others . Don't do them to be seen by others . If you do , your Father in heaven will not reward you .
40006002	" When you give to needy people , do not announce it by having trumpets blown . Do not be like those who only pretend to be holy . They announce what they do in the synagogues and on the streets . They want to be honored by others . What I'm about to tell you is true . They have received their complete reward .
40006003	" When you give to the needy , don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing .
40006004	Then your giving will be done secretly . Your Father will reward you . He sees what you do secretly .
40006005	" When you pray , do not be like those who only pretend to be holy . They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners . They want to be seen by others . What I'm about to tell you is true . They have received their complete reward .
40006006	" When you pray , go into your room . Close the door and pray to your Father , who can't be seen . He will reward you . Your Father sees what is done secretly .
40006007	" When you pray , do not keep talking on and on the way ungodly people do . They think they will be heard because they talk a lot .
40006008	Do not be like them . Your Father knows what you need even before you ask him .
40006009	" This is how you should pray . " ' Our Father in heaven , may your name be honored .
40006010	May your kingdom come . May what you want to happen be done on earth as it is done in heaven .
40006011	Give us today our daily bread .
40006012	Forgive us our sins , just as we also have forgiven those who sin against us .
40006013	Keep us from falling into sin when we are tempted . Save us from the evil one . '
40006014	" Forgive people when they sin against you . If you do , your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive people their sins , your Father will not forgive your sins .
40006016	" When you go without eating , do not look gloomy like those who only pretend to be holy . They make their faces very sad . They want to show people they are fasting . What I'm about to tell you is true . They have received their complete reward .
40006017	" But when you go without eating , put olive oil on your head . Wash your face .
40006018	Then others will not know that you are fasting . Only your Father , who can't be seen , will know it . He will reward you . Your Father sees what is done secretly .
40006019	" Do not put away riches for yourselves on earth . Moths and rust can destroy them . Thieves can break in and steal them .
40006020	Instead , put away riches for yourselves in heaven . There , moths and rust do not destroy them . There , thieves do not break in and steal them .
40006021	Your heart will be where your riches are .
40006022	" The eye is like a lamp for the body . Suppose your eyes are good . Then your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But suppose your eyes are bad . Then your whole body will be full of darkness . If the light inside you is darkness , then it is very dark !
40006024	" No one can serve two masters at the same time . He will hate one of them and love the other . Or he will be faithful to one and dislike the other . You can't serve God and Money at the same time .
40006025	" I tell you , do not worry . Don't worry about your life and what you will eat or drink . And don't worry about your body and what you will wear . Isn't there more to life than eating ? Aren't there more important things for the body than clothes ?
40006026	" Look at the birds of the air . They don't plant or gather crops . They don't put away crops in storerooms . But your Father who is in heaven feeds them . Aren't you worth much more than they are ?
40006027	" Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying ?
40006028	" And why do you worry about clothes ? See how the wild flowers grow . They don't work or make clothing .
40006029	But here is what I tell you . Not even Solomon in all of his glory was dressed like one of those flowers .
40006030	" If that is how God dresses the wild grass , won't he dress you even better ? After all , the grass is here only today . Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire . Your faith is so small !
40006031	" So don't worry . Don't say , ' What will we eat ? ' Or , ' What will we drink ? ' Or , ' What will we wear ? '
40006032	People who are ungodly run after all of those things . Your Father who is in heaven knows that you need them .
40006033	" But put God's kingdom first . Do what he wants you to do . Then all of those things will also be given to you .
40006034	" So don't worry about tomorrow . Tomorrow will worry about itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own .
40007001	" Do not judge others . Then you will not be judged .
40007002	You will be judged in the same way you judge others . You will be measured in the same way you measure others .
40007003	" You look at the bit of sawdust in your friend's eye . But you pay no attention to the piece of wood in your own eye .
40007004	How can you say to your friend , ' Let me take the bit of sawdust out of your eye ' ? How can you say this while there is a piece of wood in your own eye ?
40007005	" You pretender ! First take the piece of wood out of your own eye . Then you will be able to see clearly to take the bit of sawdust out of your friend's eye .
40007006	" Do not give holy things to dogs . Do not throw your pearls to pigs . If you do , they might walk all over them . Then they might turn around and tear you to pieces .
40007007	" Ask , and it will be given to you . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will be opened to you .
40007008	Everyone who asks will receive . He who searches will find . The door will be opened to the one who knocks .
40007009	" Suppose your son asks for bread . Which of you will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or suppose he asks for a fish . Which of you will give him a snake ?
40007011	Even though you are evil , you know how to give good gifts to your children . How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him !
40007012	" In everything , do to others what you would want them to do to you . This is what is written in the Law and in the Prophets .
40007013	" Enter God's kingdom through the narrow gate . The gate is large and the road is wide that lead to death and hell . Many people go that way .
40007014	But the gate is small and the road is narrow that lead to life . Only a few people find it .
40007015	" Watch out for false prophets . They come to you pretending to be sheep . But on the inside they are hungry wolves .
40007016	You can tell what they really are by what they do . " Do people pick grapes from bushes ? Do they pick figs from thorns ?
40007017	In the same way , every good tree bears good fruit . But a bad tree bears bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree can't bear bad fruit . And a bad tree can't bear good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down . It is thrown into the fire .
40007020	You can tell each tree by its fruit .
40007021	" Not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter the kingdom of heaven . Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants will enter .
40007022	" Many will say to me on that day , ' Lord ! Lord ! Didn't we prophesy in your name ? Didn't we drive out demons in your name ? Didn't we do many miracles in your name ? '
40007023	Then I will tell them clearly , ' I never knew you . Get away from me , you who do evil ! '
40007024	" So then , everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man . He builds his house on the rock .
40007025	The rain comes down . The water rises . The winds blow and beat against that house . But it does not fall . It is built on the rock .
40007026	" But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man . He builds his house on sand .
40007027	The rain comes down . The water rises . The winds blow and beat against that house . And it falls with a loud crash . "
40007028	Jesus finished saying all these things . The crowds were amazed at his teaching .
40007029	He taught like one who had authority . He did not speak like their teachers of the law .
40008001	Jesus came down from the mountainside . Large crowds followed him .
40008002	A man who had a skin disease came and got down on his knees in front of Jesus . He said , " Lord , if you are willing to make me ' clean , ' you can do it . "
40008003	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . " I am willing to do it , " he said . " Be ' clean ' ! " Right away the man was healed of his skin disease .
40008004	Then Jesus said to him , " Don't tell anyone . Go and show yourself to the priest . Offer the gift Moses commanded . It will be a witness to them . "
40008005	When Jesus entered Capernaum , a Roman commander came to him . He asked Jesus for help .
40008006	" Lord , " he said , " my servant lies at home and can't move . He is suffering terribly . "
40008007	Jesus said , " I will go and heal him . "
40008008	The commander replied , " Lord , I am not good enough to have you come into my house . But just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
40008009	I myself am a man under authority . And I have soldiers who obey my orders . I tell this one , ' Go , ' and he goes . I tell that one , ' Come , ' and he comes . I say to my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed . He said to those following him , " What I'm about to tell you is true . In Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong .
40008011	" I say to you that many will come from the east and the west . They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven . They will sit with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
40008012	But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside , into the darkness . There they will sob and grind their teeth . "
40008013	Then Jesus said to the Roman commander , " Go ! It will be done just as you believed it would . " And his servant was healed at that very hour .
40008014	When Jesus came into Peter's house , he saw Peter's mother-in-law . She was lying in bed . She had a fever .
40008015	Jesus touched her hand , and the fever left her . She got up and began to wait on him .
40008016	When evening came , many people controlled by demons were brought to Jesus . He drove out the spirits with a word . He healed all who were sick .
40008017	He did it to make what the prophet Isaiah had said come true . He had said , " He suffered the things we should have suffered . He took on himself the sicknesses that should have been ours . "
40008018	Jesus saw the crowd around him . So he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee .
40008019	Then a teacher of the law came to him . He said , " Teacher , I will follow you no matter where you go . "
40008020	Jesus replied , " Foxes have holes . Birds of the air have nests . But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
40008021	Another follower said to him , " Lord , first let me go and bury my father . "
40008022	But Jesus told him , " Follow me . Let the dead bury their own dead . "
40008023	Jesus got into a boat . His disciples followed him .
40008024	Suddenly a terrible storm came up on the lake . The waves crashed over the boat . But Jesus was sleeping .
40008025	The disciples went and woke him up . They said , " Lord ! Save us ! We're going to drown ! "
40008026	He replied , " Your faith is so small ! Why are you so afraid ? " Then Jesus got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop . It became completely calm .
40008027	The disciples were amazed . They asked , " What kind of man is this ? Even the winds and the waves obey him ! "
40008028	Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the area of the Gadarenes . Two men controlled by demons met him . They came from the tombs . The men were so wild that no one could pass that way .
40008029	" Son of God , what do you want with us ? " they shouted . " Have you come here to punish us before the time for us to be judged ? "
40008030	Not very far away , a large herd of pigs was feeding .
40008031	The demons begged Jesus , " If you drive us out , send us into the herd of pigs . "
40008032	Jesus said to them , " Go ! " So the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs . The whole herd rushed down the steep bank . They ran into the lake and drowned in the water .
40008033	Those who were tending the pigs ran off . They went into the town and reported all this . They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by demons .
40008034	Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus . When they saw him , they begged him to leave their area .
40009001	Jesus stepped into a boat . He went over to the other side of the lake and came to his own town .
40009002	Some men brought to him a man who could not walk . He was lying on a mat . Jesus saw that they had faith . So he said to the man , " Don't lose hope , son . Your sins are forgiven . "
40009003	Then some teachers of the law said to themselves , " This fellow is saying a very evil thing ! "
40009004	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said , " Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts ?
40009005	Is it easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven ' ? Or to say , ' Get up and walk ' ?
40009006	I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . " Then he spoke to the man who could not walk . " Get up , " he said . " Take your mat and go home . "
40009007	The man got up and went home .
40009008	When the crowd saw this , they were filled with wonder . They praised God for giving that kind of authority to men .
40009009	As Jesus went on from there , he saw a man named Matthew . He was sitting at the tax collector's booth . " Follow me , " Jesus told him . Matthew got up and followed him .
40009010	Later Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house . Many tax collectors and " sinners " came . They ate with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	The Pharisees saw this . So they asked the disciples , " Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and ' sinners' ? "
40009012	Jesus heard that . So he said , " Those who are healthy don't need a doctor . Sick people do .
40009013	Go and learn what this means , ' I want mercy and not sacrifice . ' I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me . I have come to get sinners to follow me . "
40009014	One day John's disciples came . They said to Jesus , " We and the Pharisees go without eating . Why don't your disciples go without eating ? "
40009015	Jesus answered , " How can the guests of the groom be sad while he is with them ? The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . Then they will fast .
40009016	" People don't sew a patch of new cloth on old clothes . The new piece will pull away from the old . That will make the tear worse .
40009017	" People don't pour new wine into old wineskins . If they do , the skins will burst . The wine will run out , and the wineskins will be destroyed . No , everyone pours new wine into new wineskins . Then both are saved . "
40009018	While Jesus was saying this , a ruler came . He got down on his knees in front of Jesus . He said , " My daughter has just died . But come and place your hand on her . Then she will live again . "
40009019	Jesus got up and went with him . So did his disciples .
40009020	Just then a woman came up behind Jesus . She had a sickness that made her bleed . It had lasted for 12 years . She touched the edge of his clothes .
40009021	She thought , " I only need to touch his clothes . Then I will be healed . "
40009022	Jesus turned and saw her . " Dear woman , don't give up hope , " he said . " Your faith has healed you . " The woman was healed at that very moment .
40009023	When Jesus entered the ruler's house , he saw the flute players there . And he saw the noisy crowd .
40009024	He said , " Go away . The girl is not dead . She is sleeping . " But they laughed at him .
40009025	After the crowd had been sent outside , Jesus went in . He took the girl by the hand , and she got up .
40009026	News about what Jesus had done spread all over that area .
40009027	As Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed him . They called out , " Have mercy on us , Son of David ! "
40009028	When Jesus went indoors , the blind men came to him . He asked them , " Do you believe that I can do this ? " " Yes , Lord , " they replied .
40009029	Then he touched their eyes . He said , " It will happen to you just as you believed . "
40009030	They could now see again . Jesus strongly warned them , " Be sure that no one knows about this . "
40009031	But they went out and spread the news . They talked about him all over that area .
40009032	While they were going out , another man was brought to Jesus . A demon controlled him , and he could not speak .
40009033	When the demon was driven out , the man spoke . The crowd was amazed . They said , " Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel . "
40009034	But the Pharisees said , " He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons . "
40009035	Jesus went through all the towns and villages . He taught in their synagogues . He preached the good news of the kingdom . And he healed every illness and sickness .
40009036	When he saw the crowds , he felt deep concern for them . They were beaten down and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " The harvest is huge . But there are only a few workers .
40009038	So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest field . "
40010001	Jesus called for his 12 disciples to come to him . He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every illness and sickness .
40010002	Here are the names of the 12 apostles . First are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew . Then come James , son of Zebedee , and his brother John .
40010003	Next are Philip and Bartholomew , and also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector . Two more are James , son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus .
40010004	The last are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot . Judas is the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies .
40010005	Jesus sent these 12 out with the following orders . " Do not go among those who aren't Jews , " he said . " Do not enter any town of the Samaritans .
40010006	Instead , go to the people of Israel . They are like sheep that have become lost .
40010007	As you go , preach this message , ' The kingdom of heaven is near . '
40010008	Heal those who are sick . Bring those who are dead back to life . Make those who have skin diseases ' clean ' again . Drive out demons . You have received freely , so give freely .
40010009	" Do not take along any gold , silver or copper in your belts .
40010010	Do not take a bag for the journey . Do not take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks . A worker should be given what he needs .
40010011	" When you enter a town or village , look for someone who is willing to welcome you . Stay at that person's house until you leave .
40010012	As you enter the home , greet those who live there .
40010013	If that home welcomes you , give it your blessing of peace . If it does not , don't bless it .
40010014	" Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words . If they don't , shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town .
40010015	What I'm about to tell you is true . On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town .
40010016	" I am sending you out like sheep among wolves . So be as wise as snakes and as harmless as doves .
40010017	" Watch out ! Men will hand you over to the local courts . They will whip you in their synagogues .
40010018	You will be brought to governors and kings because of me . You will be witnesses to them and to those who aren't Jews .
40010019	" But when they arrest you , don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it . At that time you will be given the right words to say .
40010020	It will not be you speaking . The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you .
40010021	" Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed . Fathers will hand over their children . Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death .
40010022	Everyone will hate you because of me . But anyone who stands firm to the end will be saved .
40010023	" When people attack you in one place , escape to another . What I'm about to tell you is true . You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	" A student is not better than his teacher . A servant is not better than his master .
40010025	It is enough for the student to be like his teacher . And it is enough for the servant to be like his master . If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub , what can the others who live there expect ?
40010026	" So don't be afraid of your enemies . Everything that is secret will be brought out into the open . Everything that is hidden will be uncovered .
40010027	What I tell you in the dark , speak in the daylight . What is whispered in your ear , shout from the rooftops .
40010028	Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but can't kill the soul . Instead , be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell .
40010029	" Aren't two sparrows sold for only a penny ? But not one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing it .
40010030	He even counts every hair on your head !
40010031	So don't be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	" What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me ? I will also say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I know him .
40010033	But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me ? I will say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I don't know him .
40010034	" Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth . I didn't come to bring peace . I came to bring a sword .
40010035	I have come to turn " ' sons against their fathers . Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers . Daughters-in-law will be against their mothers-in-law .
40010036	A man's enemies will be the members of his own family . '
40010037	" Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me . Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
40010038	And anyone who does not pick up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me .
40010039	If anyone finds his life , he will lose it . If anyone loses his life because of me , he will find it .
40010040	" Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me . And anyone who welcomes me welcomes the One who sent me .
40010041	Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet . That one will receive a prophet's reward . And suppose someone welcomes a godly person as a godly person . That one will receive a godly person's reward .
40010042	Suppose someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little one who follows me . What I'm about to tell you is true . That one will certainly be rewarded . "
40011001	Jesus finished teaching his 12 disciples . Then he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee .
40011002	John was in prison . When he heard what Christ was doing , he sent his disciples to him .
40011003	They asked Jesus , " Are you the one who was supposed to come ? Or should we look for someone else ? "
40011004	Jesus replied , " Go back to John . Report to him what you hear and see .
40011005	Blind people receive sight . Disabled people walk . Those who have skin diseases are healed . Deaf people hear . Those who are dead are raised to life . And the good news is preached to those who are poor .
40011006	Blessed are those who do not give up their faith because of me . "
40011007	As John's disciples were leaving , Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John . He said , " What did you go out into the desert to see ? Tall grass waving in the wind ?
40011008	If not , what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No . People who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces .
40011009	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	He is the one written about in Scripture . It says , " ' I will send my messenger ahead of you . He will prepare your way for you . '
40011011	" What I'm about to tell you is true . No one more important than John the Baptist has ever been born . But the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than he is .
40011012	Since the days of John the Baptist , the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with force . And forceful people are taking hold of it .
40011013	All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came .
40011014	If you are willing to accept it , John is the Elijah who was supposed to come .
40011015	Those who have ears should listen .
40011016	" What can I compare today's people to ? They are like children sitting in the market places and calling out to others . They say ,
40011017	" ' We played the flute for you . But you didn't dance . We sang a funeral song . But you didn't become sad . '
40011018	When John came , he didn't eat or drink as you do . And people say , ' He has a demon . '
40011019	But when the Son of Man came , he ate and drank as you do . And people say , ' This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much . He's a friend of tax collectors and " sinners . " ' Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right . "
40011020	Jesus began to speak against the cities where he had done most of his miracles . The people there had not turned away from their sins . So he said ,
40011021	" How terrible it will be for you , Korazin ! How terrible for you , Bethsaida ! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon . They would have turned away from their sins long ago . They would have put on black clothes . They would have sat down in ashes .
40011022	But I tell you this . On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
40011023	" And what about you , Capernaum ? Will you be lifted up to heaven ? No ! You will go down to the place of the dead . Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom . It would still be here today .
40011024	But I tell you this . On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for you . "
40011025	At that time Jesus said , " I praise you , Father . You are Lord of heaven and earth . You have hidden these things from the wise and educated . But you have shown them to little children .
40011026	Yes , Father . This is what you wanted .
40011027	" My Father has given all things to me . The Father is the only one who knows the Son . And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known .
40011028	" Come to me , all of you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads . I will give you rest .
40011029	Become my servants and learn from me . I am gentle and free of pride . You will find rest for your souls .
40011030	Serving me is easy , and my load is light . "
40012001	One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields . His disciples were hungry . So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them .
40012002	The Pharisees saw this . They said to Jesus , " Look ! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath . But your disciples are doing it anyway ! "
40012003	Jesus answered , " Haven't you read about what David did ? He and his men were hungry .
40012004	So he entered the house of God . He and his men ate the holy bread . Only priests were allowed to eat it .
40012005	Haven't you read the Law ? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day . But they are not considered guilty .
40012006	" I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here .
40012007	Scripture says , ' I want mercy and not sacrifice . ' You don't know what those words mean . If you did , you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty .
40012008	The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day . "
40012009	Going on from that place , Jesus went into their synagogue .
40012010	A man with a weak and twisted hand was there . The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus . So they asked him , " Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day ? "
40012011	He said to them , " What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath ? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	A man is worth more than sheep ! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day . "
40012013	Then Jesus said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " So he stretched it out . It was as good as new , just as good as the other hand .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus .
40012015	Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans . So he left that place . Many followed him , and he healed all their sick people .
40012016	But he warned them not to tell who he was .
40012017	This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true . It says ,
40012018	" Here is my servant . I have chosen him . He is the one I love . I am very pleased with him . I will put my Spirit on him . He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right .
40012019	He will not argue or cry out . No one will hear his voice in the streets .
40012020	He will not break a bent twig . He will not put out a dimly burning flame . He will make everything right .
40012021	The nations will put their hope in him . "
40012022	A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus . The man was blind and could not speak . Jesus healed him . Then the man could speak and see .
40012023	All the people were amazed . They said , " Could this be the Son of David ? "
40012024	The Pharisees heard this . So they said , " This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub , the prince of demons . "
40012025	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said to them , " Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed . Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand .
40012026	If Satan drives out Satan , he fights against himself . Then how can his kingdom stand ?
40012027	You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub . Then by whose power do your people drive them out ? So then , they will be your judges .
40012028	But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God . Then God's kingdom has come to you .
40012029	" Or think about this . How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns ? You must first tie him up . Then you can rob his house .
40012030	" Anyone who is not with me is against me . Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them .
40012031	So here is what I tell you . Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven . But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven . But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven . A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come .
40012033	" If you make a tree good , its fruit will be good . If you make a tree bad , its fruit will be bad . You can tell a tree by its fruit .
40012034	" You nest of poisonous snakes ! How can you who are evil say anything good ? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts .
40012035	A good man says good things . These come from the good that is put away inside him . An evil man says evil things . These come from the evil that is put away inside him .
40012036	But here is what I tell you . On judgment day , people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken .
40012037	By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty . "
40012038	Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus . They said , " Teacher , we want to see a miraculous sign from you . "
40012039	He answered , " Evil and unfaithful people ask for a miraculous sign ! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and three nights . Something like that will happen to the Son of Man . He will spend three days and three nights in the grave .
40012041	" The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living . And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty . The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them . And now one who is more important than Jonah is here .
40012042	" The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living . And she will prove that they are guilty . She came from very far away to listen to Solomon's wisdom . And now one who is more important than Solomon is here .
40012043	" What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man ? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest . But it doesn't find it .
40012044	Then it says , ' I will return to the house I left . ' When it arrives there , it finds the house empty . The house has been swept clean and put in order .
40012045	Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and live there . That man is worse off than before . That is how it will be with the evil people of today . "
40012046	While Jesus was still talking to the crowd , his mother and brothers stood outside . They wanted to speak to him .
40012047	Someone told him , " Your mother and brothers are standing outside . They want to speak to you . "
40012048	Jesus replied to him , " Who is my mother ? And who are my brothers ? "
40012049	Jesus pointed to his disciples . He said , " Here is my mother ! Here are my brothers !
40012050	Anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother . "
40013001	That same day Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee .
40013002	Large crowds gathered around him . So he got into a boat . He sat down in it . All the people stood on the shore .
40013003	Then he told them many things by using stories . He said , " A farmer went out to plant his seed .
40013004	He scattered the seed on the ground . Some fell on a path . Birds came and ate it up .
40013005	Some seed fell on rocky places , where there wasn't much soil . The plants came up quickly , because the soil wasn't deep .
40013006	When the sun came up , it burned the plants . They dried up because they had no roots .
40013007	Other seed fell among thorns . The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants .
40013008	Still other seed fell on good soil . It produced a crop 100 , 60 or 30 times more than what was planted .
40013009	Those who have ears should listen . "
40013010	The disciples came to him . They asked , " Why do you use stories when you speak to the people ? "
40013011	He replied , " You have been given the chance to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven . It has not been given to outsiders .
40013012	Everyone who has that kind of knowledge will be given more . In fact , they will have very much . If anyone doesn't have that kind of knowledge , even what little he has will be taken away from him .
40013013	Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people . I say , " They look , but they don't really see . They listen , but they don't really hear or understand .
40013014	" In them the words of the prophet Isaiah come true . He said , " ' You will hear but never understand . You will see but never know what you are seeing .
40013015	The hearts of these people have become stubborn . They can barely hear with their ears . They have closed their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes . They might hear with their ears . They might understand with their hearts . They might turn to the Lord , and then he would heal them . '
40013016	" But blessed are your eyes because they see . And blessed are your ears because they hear .
40013017	What I'm about to tell you is true . Many prophets and godly people wanted to see what you see . But they didn't see it . They wanted to hear what you hear . But they didn't hear it .
40013018	" Listen ! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer .
40013019	People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it . Then the evil one comes . He steals what was planted in their hearts . Those people are like the seed planted on a path .
40013020	Others received the seed that fell on rocky places . They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy .
40013021	But they have no roots . So they last only a short time . They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message .
40013022	Others received the seed that fell among the thorns . They are those who hear the message . But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out . They keep it from producing fruit .
40013023	But still others received the seed that fell on good soil . They are those who hear the message and understand it . They produce a crop 100 , 60 or 30 times more than the farmer planted . "
40013024	Jesus told the crowd another story . " Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like , " he said . " A man planted good seed in his field .
40013025	But while everyone was sleeping , his enemy came . The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away .
40013026	The wheat began to grow and form grain . At the same time , weeds appeared .
40013027	" The owner's servants came to him . They said , ' Sir , didn't you plant good seed in your field ? Then where did the weeds come from ? '
40013028	" ' An enemy did this , ' he replied . " The servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and pull the weeds up ? '
40013029	" ' No , ' the owner answered . ' While you are pulling up the weeds , you might pull up the wheat with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest . At that time I will tell the workers what to do . Here is what I will say to them . First collect the weeds . Tie them in bundles to be burned . Then gather the wheat . Bring it into my storeroom . ' "
40013031	Jesus told the crowd another story . He said , " The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed . Someone took the seed and planted it in a field .
40013032	It is the smallest of all your seeds . But when it grows , it is the largest of all garden plants . It becomes a tree . Birds come and rest in its branches . "
40013033	Jesus told them still another story . " The kingdom of heaven is like yeast , " he said . " A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour . The yeast worked its way all through the dough . "
40013034	Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd by using stories . He did not say anything to them without telling a story .
40013035	So the words spoken by the prophet came true . He had said , " I will open my mouth and tell stories . I will speak about things that were hidden since the world was made . "
40013036	Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house . His disciples came to him . They said , " Explain to us the story of the weeds in the field . "
40013037	He answered , " The one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man .
40013038	The field is the world . The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom . The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one .
40013039	The enemy who plants them is the devil . The harvest is judgment day . And the workers are angels .
40013040	" The weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire . That is how it will be on judgment day .
40013041	The Son of Man will send out his angels . They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin . They will also get rid of all who do evil .
40013042	They will throw them into the blazing furnace . There people will sob and grind their teeth .
40013043	Then God's people will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom . Those who have ears should listen .
40013044	" The kingdom of heaven is like treasure that was hidden in a field . When a man found it , he hid it again . He was very happy . So he went and sold everything he had . And he bought that field .
40013045	" Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls .
40013046	He found one that was very valuable . So he went away and sold everything he had . And he bought that pearl .
40013047	" Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net . It was let down into the lake . It caught all kinds of fish .
40013048	When it was full , the fishermen pulled it up on the shore . Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets . But they threw the bad fish away .
40013049	This is how it will be on judgment day . The angels will come . They will separate the people who did what is wrong from those who did what is right .
40013050	They will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace . There the evil ones will sob and grind their teeth .
40013051	" Do you understand all these things ? " Jesus asked . " Yes , " they replied .
40013052	He said to them , " Every teacher of the law who has been taught about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house . He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones . "
40013053	Jesus finished telling these stories . Then he moved on from there .
40013054	He came to his hometown of Nazareth . There he began teaching the people in their synagogue . They were amazed . " Where did this man get this wisdom ? Where did he get this power to do miracles ? " they asked .
40013055	" Isn't this the carpenter's son ? Isn't his mother's name Mary ? Aren't his brothers James , Joseph , Simon and Judas ?
40013056	Aren't all his sisters with us ? Then where did this man get all these things ? "
40013057	They were not pleased with him at all . But Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not honored in his hometown . He doesn't receive any honor in his own home . "
40013058	He did only a few miracles there because they had no faith .
40014001	At that time Herod , the ruler of Galilee and Perea , heard reports about Jesus .
40014002	He said to his attendants , " This is John the Baptist . He has risen from the dead ! That is why he has the power to do miracles . "
40014003	Herod had arrested John . He had tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias . She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip .
40014004	John had been saying to Herod , " It is against the Law for you to have her . "
40014005	Herod wanted to kill John . But he was afraid of the people , because they thought John was a prophet .
40014006	On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests . She pleased Herod very much .
40014007	So he promised with an oath to give her anything she asked for .
40014008	Her mother told her what to say . So the girl said to Herod , " Give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate . "
40014009	The king was very upset . But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests . So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for .
40014010	Herod had John's head cut off in the prison .
40014011	His head was brought in on a big plate and given to the girl . She then carried it to her mother .
40014012	John's disciples came and took his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus .
40014013	Jesus heard what had happened to John . He wanted to be alone . So he went in a boat to a quiet place . The crowds heard about this . They followed him on foot from the towns .
40014014	When Jesus came ashore , he saw a large crowd . He felt deep concern for them . He healed their sick people .
40014015	When it was almost evening , the disciples came to him . " There is nothing here , " they said . " It's already getting late . Send the crowds away . They can go and buy some food in the villages . "
40014016	Jesus replied , " They don't need to go away . You give them something to eat . "
40014017	" We have only five loaves of bread and two fish , " they answered .
40014018	" Bring them here to me , " he said .
40014019	Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and gave thanks . He broke the loaves into pieces . Then he gave them to the disciples . And the disciples gave them to the people .
40014020	All of them ate and were satisfied . The disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftover pieces .
40014021	The number of men who ate was about 5,000 . Women and children also ate .
40014022	Right away Jesus made the disciples get into the boat . He had them go on ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee . Then he sent the crowd away .
40014023	After he had sent them away , he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray . When evening came , he was there alone .
40014024	The boat was already a long way from land . It was being pounded by the waves because the wind was blowing against it .
40014025	Early in the morning , Jesus went out to the disciples . He walked on the lake .
40014026	They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified . " It's a ghost ! " they said . And they cried out in fear .
40014027	Right away Jesus called out to them , " Be brave ! It is I . Don't be afraid . "
40014028	" Lord , is it you ? " Peter asked . " If it is , tell me to come to you on the water . "
40014029	" Come , " Jesus said . So Peter got out of the boat . He walked on the water toward Jesus .
40014030	But when Peter saw the wind , he was afraid . He began to sink . He cried out , " Lord ! Save me ! "
40014031	Right away Jesus reached out his hand and caught him . " Your faith is so small ! " he said . " Why did you doubt me ? "
40014032	When they climbed into the boat , the wind died down .
40014033	Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus . They said , " You really are the Son of God ! "
40014034	They crossed over the lake and landed at Gennesaret .
40014035	The men who lived there recognized Jesus . So they sent a message all over the nearby countryside . People brought all their sick to Jesus .
40014036	They begged him to let those who were sick just touch the edge of his clothes . And all who touched him were healed .
40015001	Some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus . They asked ,
40015002	" Why don't your disciples obey what the elders teach ? Your disciples don't wash their hands before they eat ! "
40015003	Jesus replied , " And why don't you obey God's command ? You would rather follow your own teachings !
40015004	God said , ' Honor your father and mother . ' He also said , ' If anyone calls down a curse on his father or mother , he will be put to death . '
40015005	But you allow people to say to their parents , ' Any help you might have received from us is a gift set apart for God . '
40015006	So they do not need to honor their parents with their gift . You make the word of God useless in order to follow your own teachings .
40015007	" You pretenders ! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you . He said ,
40015008	" ' These people honor me by what they say . But their hearts are far away from me .
40015009	Their worship doesn't mean anything to me . They teach nothing but human rules . ' "
40015010	Jesus called the crowd to him . He said , " Listen and understand .
40015011	What goes into your mouth does not make you ' unclean . ' It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you ' unclean . ' "
40015012	Then the disciples came to him . They asked , " Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this ? "
40015013	Jesus replied , " There are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted . They will be pulled up by the roots .
40015014	Leave them . The Pharisees are blind guides . If a blind person leads another who is blind , both of them will fall into a pit . "
40015015	Peter said , " Explain this to us . "
40015016	" Don't you understand yet ? " Jesus asked them .
40015017	" Don't you see ? Everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach . Then it goes out of the body .
40015018	But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart . Those are the things that make you ' unclean . '
40015019	Evil thoughts come out of the heart . So do murder , adultery , and other sexual sins . And so do stealing , false witness , and telling lies about others .
40015020	Those are the things that make you ' unclean . ' But eating without washing your hands does not make you ' unclean . ' "
40015021	Jesus left Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	A woman from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon . She came to him and cried out , " Lord ! Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! A demon controls my daughter . She is suffering terribly . "
40015023	Jesus did not say a word . So his disciples came to him . They begged him , " Send her away . She keeps crying out after us . "
40015024	Jesus answered , " I was sent only to the people of Israel . They are like lost sheep . "
40015025	Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him . " Lord ! Help me ! " she said .
40015026	He replied , " It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs . "
40015027	" Yes , Lord , " she said . " But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their owners' table . "
40015028	Then Jesus answered , " Woman , you have great faith ! You will be given what you are asking for . " And her daughter was healed at that very moment .
40015029	Jesus left there . He walked along the Sea of Galilee . Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down .
40015030	Large crowds came to him . They brought blind people and those who could not walk . They also brought disabled people , those who could not speak , and many others . They laid them at his feet , and he healed them .
40015031	The people were amazed . Those who could not speak were speaking . The disabled were made well . Those not able to walk were walking . Those who were blind could see . So the people praised the God of Israel .
40015032	Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him . He said , " I feel deep concern for these people . They have already been with me three days . They don't have anything to eat . I don't want to send them away hungry . If I do , they will become too weak on their way home . "
40015033	His disciples answered him . " There is nothing here , " they said . " Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd ? "
40015034	" How many loaves do you have ? " Jesus asked . " Seven , " they replied , " and a few small fish . "
40015035	Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground .
40015036	He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks . Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples . And the disciples passed them out to the people .
40015037	All of them ate and were satisfied . After that , the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces .
40015038	The number of men who ate was 4,000 . Women and children also ate .
40015039	After Jesus had sent the crowd away , he got into the boat . He went to the area near Magadan .
40016001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to put Jesus to the test . They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven .
40016002	He replied , " In the evening you look at the sky . You say , ' It will be good weather . The sky is red . '
40016003	And in the morning you say , ' Today it will be stormy . The sky is red and cloudy . ' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky . But you can't understand the signs of what is happening right now .
40016004	An evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign . But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah . " Then Jesus left them and went away .
40016005	The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake . They had forgotten to take bread .
40016006	" Be careful , " Jesus said to them . " Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016007	The disciples talked about this among themselves . They said , " He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread . "
40016008	Jesus knew what they were saying . So he said , " Your faith is so small ! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread ?
40016009	Don't you understand yet ? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 ? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered ?
40016010	Don't you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000 ? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered ?
40016011	How can you possibly not understand ? I wasn't talking to you about bread . But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016012	Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread . He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught .
40016013	Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi . There he asked his disciples , " Who do people say the Son of Man is ? "
40016014	They replied , " Some say John the Baptist . Others say Elijah . Still others say Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . "
40016015	" But what about you ? " he asked . " Who do you say I am ? "
40016016	Simon Peter answered , " You are the Christ . You are the Son of the living God . "
40016017	Jesus replied , " Blessed are you , Simon , son of Jonah ! No mere man showed this to you . My Father in heaven showed it to you .
40016018	Here is what I tell you . You are Peter . On this rock I will build my church . The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it .
40016019	I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven . What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven . What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven . "
40016020	Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him . He told them he must go to Jerusalem . There he must suffer many things from the elders , the chief priests and the teachers of the law . He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again .
40016022	Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him . " Never , Lord ! " he said . " This will never happen to you ! "
40016023	Jesus turned and said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ! You are standing in my way . You do not have in mind the things of God . Instead , you are thinking about human things . "
40016024	Then Jesus spoke to his disciples . He said , " If anyone wants to follow me , he must say no to himself . He must pick up his cross and follow me .
40016025	If he wants to save his life , he will lose it . But if he loses his life for me , he will find it .
40016026	" What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses his soul ? Or what can anyone trade for his soul ?
40016027	The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory . His angels will come with him . And he will reward everyone in keeping with what they have done .
40016028	" What I'm about to tell you is true . Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . "
40017001	After six days Jesus took Peter , James , and John the brother of James with him . He led them up a high mountain . They were all alone .
40017002	There in front of them his appearance was changed . His face shone like the sun . His clothes became as white as the light .
40017003	Just then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of them . Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus .
40017004	Peter said to Jesus , " Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you wish , I will put up three shelters . One will be for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
40017005	While Peter was still speaking , a bright cloud surrounded them . A voice from the cloud said , " This is my Son , and I love him . I am very pleased with him . Listen to him ! "
40017006	When the disciples heard this , they were terrified . They fell with their faces to the ground .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them . " Get up , " he said . " Don't be afraid . "
40017008	When they looked up , they saw no one except Jesus .
40017009	They came down the mountain . On the way down , Jesus told them what to do . " Don't tell anyone what you have seen , " he said . " Wait until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead . "
40017010	The disciples asked him , " Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first ? "
40017011	Jesus replied , " That's right . Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again .
40017012	But I tell you , Elijah has already come . People didn't recognize him . They have done to him everything they wanted to do . In the same way , they are going to make the Son of Man suffer . "
40017013	Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist .
40017014	When they came near the crowd , a man approached Jesus . He got on his knees in front of him .
40017015	" Lord , " he said , " have mercy on my son . He shakes wildly and suffers a great deal . He often falls into the fire or into the water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples . But they couldn't heal him . "
40017017	" You unbelieving and evil people ! " Jesus replied . " How long do I have to stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me . "
40017018	Jesus ordered the demon to leave the boy , and it came out of him . He was healed at that very moment .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private . They asked , " Why couldn't we drive out the demon ? "
40017022	They came together in Galilee . Then Jesus said to them , " The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men .
40017023	They will kill him . On the third day he will rise from the dead . " Then the disciples were filled with deep sadness .
40017024	Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum . There the tax collectors came to Peter . They asked him , " Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax ? "
40017025	" Yes , he does , " he replied . When Peter came into the house , Jesus spoke first . " What do you think , Simon ? " he asked . " Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and fees from ? Do they collect from their own sons or from others ? "
40017026	" From others , " Peter answered . " Then the sons don't have to pay , " Jesus said to him .
40017027	" But we don't want to make them angry . So go to the lake and throw out your fishing line . Take the first fish you catch . Open its mouth . There you will find the exact coin you need . Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours . "
40018001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus . They asked him , " Who is the most important person in the kingdom of heaven ? "
40018002	Jesus called a little child over to him . He had the child stand among them .
40018003	Jesus said , " What I'm about to tell you is true . You need to change and become like little children . If you don't , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Anyone who becomes as free of pride as this child is the most important in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	" Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me .
40018006	" But what if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me to sin ? If he does , it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea .
40018007	" How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people to sin ! Things like that must come . But how terrible for those who cause them !
40018008	" If your hand or foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one hand or one foot than to go into hell with two hands and two feet . In hell the fire burns forever .
40018009	If your eye causes you to sin , poke it out and throw it away . It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell .
40018012	" What do you think ? Suppose a man owns 100 sheep and one of them wanders away . Won't he leave the 99 sheep on the hills ? Won't he go and look for the one that wandered off ?
40018013	What I'm about to tell you is true . If he finds that sheep , he is happier about the one than about the 99 that didn't wander off .
40018014	It is the same with your Father in heaven . He does not want any of these little ones to be lost .
40018015	" If your brother sins against you , go to him . Tell him what he did wrong . Keep it between the two of you . If he listens to you , you have won him back .
40018016	" But what if he won't listen to you ? Then take one or two others with you . Scripture says , ' Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses . '
40018017	But what if he also refuses to listen to the witnesses ? Then tell it to the church . And what if he refuses to listen even to the church ? Then don't treat him as your brother . Treat him as you would treat an ungodly person or a tax collector .
40018018	" What I'm about to tell you is true . What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven . What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven .
40018019	" Again , here is what I tell you . Suppose two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for . My Father in heaven will do it for you .
40018020	Where two or three people meet together in my name , I am there with them . "
40018021	Peter came to Jesus . He asked , " Lord , how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me ? Up to seven times ? "
40018022	Jesus answered , " I tell you , not seven times , but 77 times .
40018023	" The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money his servants owed him .
40018024	As the king began to do it , a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him .
40018025	The man was not able to pay . So his master gave an order . The man , his wife , his children , and all he owned had to be sold to pay back what he owed .
40018026	" The servant fell on his knees in front of him . ' Give me time , ' he begged . ' I'll pay everything back . '
40018027	" His master felt sorry for him . He forgave him what he owed and let him go .
40018028	" But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars . He grabbed him and began to choke him . ' Pay back what you owe me ! ' he said .
40018029	" The other servant fell on his knees . ' Give me time , ' he begged him . ' I'll pay you back . '
40018030	" But the first servant refused . Instead , he went and had the man thrown into prison . The man would be held there until he could pay back what he owed .
40018031	The other servants saw what had happened . It troubled them greatly . They went and told their master everything that had happened .
40018032	" Then the master called the first servant in . ' You evil servant , ' he said . ' I forgave all that you owed me because you begged me to .
40018033	Shouldn't you have had mercy on the other servant just as I had mercy on you ? '
40018034	In anger his master turned him over to the jailers . He would be punished until he paid back everything he owed .
40018035	" This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart . "
40019001	When Jesus finished saying these things , he left Galilee . He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River .
40019002	Large crowds followed him . He healed them there .
40019003	Some Pharisees came to put him to the test . They asked , " Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all ? "
40019004	Jesus replied , " Haven't you read that in the beginning the Creator ' made them male and female ' ?
40019005	He said , ' That's why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife . The two will become one . '
40019006	They are no longer two , but one . So a man must not separate what God has joined together . "
40019007	They asked , " Then why did Moses command that a man can give his wife a letter of divorce and send her away ? "
40019008	Jesus replied , " Moses let you divorce your wives because you were stubborn . But it was not this way from the beginning .
40019009	Here is what I tell you . Anyone who divorces his wife and gets married to another woman commits adultery . A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him . "
40019010	The disciples said to him , " If that's the way it is between a husband and wife , it is better not to get married . "
40019011	Jesus replied , " Not everyone can accept the idea of staying single . Only those who have been helped to live without getting married can accept it .
40019012	Some men are not able to have children because they were born that way . Some have been made that way by other people . Others have made themselves that way in order to serve the kingdom of heaven . The one who can accept living that way should do it . "
40019013	Some people brought little children to Jesus . They wanted him to place his hands on the children and pray for them . But the disciples told the people to stop .
40019014	Jesus said , " Let the little children come to me . Don't keep them away . The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them . "
40019015	Jesus placed his hands on them . Then he went on from there .
40019016	A man came up to Jesus . He asked , " Teacher , what good thing must I do to receive eternal life ? "
40019017	" Why do you ask me about what is good ? " Jesus replied . " There is only One who is good . If you want to enter the kingdom , obey the commandments . "
40019018	" Which ones ? " the man asked . Jesus said , " ' Do not commit murder . Do not commit adultery . Do not steal . Do not give false witness .
40019019	Honor your father and mother . ' And ' love your neighbor as you love yourself . ' "
40019020	" I have obeyed all those commandments , " the young man said . " What else do I need to do ? "
40019021	Jesus answered , " If you want to be perfect , go and sell everything you have . Give the money to those who are poor . You will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . "
40019022	When the young man heard this , he went away sad . He was very rich .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " What I'm about to tell you is true . It is hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle . But it is even harder for the rich to enter God's kingdom . "
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were really amazed . They asked , " Then who can be saved ? "
40019026	Jesus looked at them and said , " With man , that is impossible . But with God , all things are possible . "
40019027	Peter answered him , " We have left everything to follow you ! What reward will be given to us ? "
40019028	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " Jesus said to them . " When all things are made new , the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne . Then you who have followed me will also sit on 12 thrones . You will judge the 12 tribes of Israel .
40019029	Everyone who has left houses or families or fields because of me will receive 100 times as much . They will also receive eternal life .
40019030	But many who are first will be last . And many who are last will be first .
40020001	" The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned land . He went out early in the morning to hire people to work in his vineyard .
40020002	He agreed to give them the usual pay for a day's work . Then he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	" About nine o'clock in the morning he went out again . He saw others standing in the market place doing nothing .
40020004	He told them , ' You also go and work in my vineyard . I'll pay you what is right . '
40020005	So they went . " He went out again about noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing .
40020006	About five o'clock he went out and found still others standing around . He asked them , ' Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing ? '
40020007	" ' Because no one has hired us , ' they answered . " He said to them , ' You also go and work in my vineyard . '
40020008	" When evening came , the owner of the vineyard spoke to the person who was in charge of the workers . He said , ' Call the workers and give them their pay . Begin with the last ones I hired . Then go on to the first ones . '
40020009	" The workers who were hired about five o'clock came . Each received the usual day's pay .
40020010	So when those who were hired first came , they expected to receive more . But each of them also received the usual day's pay .
40020011	" When they received it , they began to complain about the owner .
40020012	' These people who were hired last worked only one hour , ' they said . ' You have paid them the same as us . We have done most of the work and have been in the hot sun all day . '
40020013	" The owner answered one of them . ' Friend , ' he said , ' I'm being fair to you . Didn't you agree to work for the usual day's pay ?
40020014	Take your money and go . I want to give the ones I hired last the same pay I gave you .
40020015	Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money ? Do you feel cheated because I gave so freely to the others ? '
40020016	" So those who are last will be first . And those who are first will be last . "
40020017	Jesus was going up to Jerusalem . On the way , he took the 12 disciples to one side to talk to them .
40020018	" We are going up to Jerusalem , " he said . " The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law . They will sentence him to death .
40020019	Then they will turn him over to people who are not Jews . The people will make fun of him and whip him . They will nail him to a cross . On the third day , he will rise from the dead ! "
40020020	The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus . Her sons came with her . Getting on her knees , she asked a favor of him .
40020021	" What do you want ? " Jesus asked . She said , " Promise me that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom . Promise that the other one may sit at your left hand . "
40020022	" You don't know what you're asking for , " Jesus said to them . " Can you drink the cup of suffering I am going to drink ? " " We can , " they answered .
40020023	Jesus said to them , " You will certainly drink from my cup . But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left hand . These places belong to those my Father has prepared them for . "
40020024	The other ten disciples heard about this . They became angry at the two brothers .
40020025	Jesus called them together . He said , " You know about the rulers of the nations . They hold power over their people . Their high officials order them around .
40020026	Don't be like that . Instead , anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant .
40020027	And anyone who wants to be first must be your slave .
40020028	" Be like the Son of Man . He did not come to be served . Instead , he came to serve others . He came to give his life as the price for setting many people free . "
40020029	Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho . A large crowd followed him .
40020030	Two blind men were sitting by the side of the road . They heard that Jesus was going by . So they shouted , " Lord ! Son of David ! Have mercy on us ! "
40020031	The crowd commanded them to stop . They told them to be quiet . But the two men shouted even louder , " Lord ! Son of David ! Have mercy on us ! "
40020032	Jesus stopped and called out to them . " What do you want me to do for you ? " he asked .
40020033	" Lord , " they answered , " we want to be able to see . "
40020034	Jesus felt deep concern for them . He touched their eyes . Right away they could see . And they followed him .
40021001	As they all approached Jerusalem , they came to Bethphage . It was on the Mount of Olives . Jesus sent out two disciples .
40021002	He said to them , " Go to the village ahead of you . As soon as you get there , you will find a donkey tied up . Her colt will be with her . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , say that the Lord needs them . The owner will send them right away . "
40021004	This took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would come true . It says ,
40021005	" Say to the city of Zion , ' See , your king comes to you . He is gentle and riding on a donkey . He is riding on a donkey's colt . ' "
40021006	The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt . They placed their coats on them . Then Jesus sat on the coats .
40021008	A very large crowd spread their coats on the road . Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	Some of the people went ahead of him , and some followed . They all shouted , " Hosanna to the Son of David ! " " Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! " " Hosanna in the highest heaven ! "
40021010	When Jesus entered Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred up . The people asked , " Who is this ? "
40021011	The crowds answered , " This is Jesus . He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee . "
40021012	Jesus entered the temple area . He began chasing out all those who were buying and selling there . He turned over the tables of the people who were exchanging money . He also turned over the benches of those who were selling doves .
40021013	He said to them , " It is written that the Lord said , ' My house will be called a house where people can pray . ' But you are making it a ' den for robbers . ' "
40021014	Blind people and those who were disabled came to Jesus at the temple . There he healed them .
40021015	The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did . They also saw the children in the temple area shouting , " Hosanna to the Son of David ! " But when they saw all of this , they became angry .
40021016	" Do you hear what these children are saying ? " they asked him . " Yes , " replied Jesus . " Haven't you ever read about it in Scripture ? It says , " ' You have made sure that children and infants praise you . ' "
40021017	Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany . He spent the night there .
40021018	Early in the morning , Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem . He was hungry .
40021019	He saw a fig tree by the road . He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves . Then he said to it , " May you never bear fruit again ! " Right away the tree dried up .
40021020	When the disciples saw this , they were amazed . " How did the fig tree dry up so quickly ? " they asked .
40021021	Jesus replied , " What I'm about to tell you is true . You must have faith and not doubt . Then you can do what was done to the fig tree . And you can say to this mountain , ' Go and throw yourself into the sea . ' It will be done .
40021022	If you believe , you will receive what you ask for when you pray . "
40021023	Jesus entered the temple courtyard . While he was teaching there , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him . " By what authority are you doing these things ? " they asked . " Who gave you this authority ? "
40021024	Jesus replied , " I will also ask you one question . If you answer me , I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
40021025	Where did John's baptism come from ? Was it from heaven ? Or did it come from men ? " They talked to each other about it . They said , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask , ' Then why didn't you believe him ? '
40021026	But what if we say , ' From men ' ? We are afraid of the people . Everyone believes that John was a prophet . "
40021027	So they answered Jesus , " We don't know . " Jesus said , " Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things either .
40021028	" What do you think about this ? A man had two sons . He went to the first and said , ' Son , go and work today in the vineyard . '
40021029	" ' I will not , ' the son answered . But later he changed his mind and went .
40021030	" Then the father went to the other son . He said the same thing . The son answered , ' I will , sir . ' But he did not go .
40021031	" Which of the two sons did what his father wanted ? " " The first , " they answered . Jesus said to them , " What I'm about to tell you is true . Tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you .
40021032	John came to show you the right way to live . And you did not believe him . But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did . You saw this . But even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him .
40021033	" Listen to another story . A man who owned some land planted a vineyard . He put a wall around it . He dug a pit for a winepress in it . He also built a lookout tower . He rented the vineyard out to some farmers . Then he went away on a journey .
40021034	When harvest time approached , he sent his servants to the renters . He told the servants to collect his share of the fruit .
40021035	" But the renters grabbed his servants . They beat one of them . They killed another . They threw stones at the third to kill him .
40021036	Then the man sent other servants to the renters . He sent more than he did the first time . The renters treated them the same way .
40021037	" Last of all , he sent his son to them . ' They will respect my son , ' he said .
40021038	" But the renters saw the son coming . They said to each other , ' This is the one who will receive all the owner's property someday . Come , let's kill him . Then everything will be ours . '
40021039	So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard . Then they killed him .
40021040	" When the owner of the vineyard comes back , what will he do to those renters ? "
40021041	" He will destroy those evil people , " they replied . " Then he will rent the vineyard out to other renters . They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time . "
40021042	Jesus said to them , " Haven't you ever read what the Scriptures say , " ' The stone the builders didn't accept has become the most important stone of all . The Lord has done it . It is wonderful in our eyes' ?
40021043	" So here is what I tell you . The kingdom of God will be taken away from you . It will be given to people who will produce its fruit .
40021044	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces . But the stone will crush anyone it falls on . "
40021045	The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories . They knew he was talking about them .
40021046	So they looked for a way to arrest him . But they were afraid of the crowd . The people believed that Jesus was a prophet .
40022001	Jesus told them more stories . He said ,
40022002	" Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like . A king prepared a wedding dinner for his son .
40022003	He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner . The servants told them to come . But they refused .
40022004	" Then he sent some more servants . He said , ' Tell those who were invited that I have prepared my dinner . I have killed my oxen and my fattest cattle . Everything is ready . Come to the wedding dinner . '
40022005	" But the people paid no attention . One went away to his field . Another went away to his business .
40022006	The rest grabbed his servants . They treated them badly and then killed them .
40022007	" The king became very angry . He sent his army to destroy them . They killed those murderers and burned their city .
40022008	" Then the king said to his servants , ' The wedding dinner is ready . But those I invited were not fit to come .
40022009	Go to the street corners . Invite to the dinner anyone you can find . '
40022010	So the servants went out into the streets . They gathered all the people they could find , both good and bad . Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests .
40022011	" The king came in to see the guests . He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes .
40022012	' Friend , ' he asked , ' how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ' The man couldn't think of anything to say .
40022013	" Then the king told his servants , ' Tie up his hands and feet . Throw him outside into the darkness . Out there people will sob and grind their teeth . '
40022014	" Many are invited , but few are chosen . "
40022015	The Pharisees went out . They made plans to trap Jesus with his own words .
40022016	They sent their followers to him . They sent the Herodians with them . " Teacher , " they said , " we know you are a man of honor . You teach the way of God truthfully . You don't let others tell you what to do or say . You don't care how important they are .
40022017	Tell us then , what do you think ? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? "
40022018	But Jesus knew their evil plans . He said , " You pretenders ! Why are you trying to trap me ?
40022019	Show me the coin people use for paying the tax . " They brought him a silver coin .
40022020	He asked them , " Whose picture is this ? And whose words ? "
40022021	" Caesar's , " they replied . Then he said to them , " Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar . And give to God what belongs to God . "
40022022	When they heard this , they were amazed . So they left him and went away .
40022023	That same day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question . They do not believe that people rise from the dead .
40022024	" Teacher , " they said , " here is what Moses told us . If a man dies without having children , his brother must get married to the widow . He must have children to carry on his brother's name .
40022025	There were seven brothers among us . The first one got married and died . Since he had no children , he left his wife to his brother .
40022026	The same thing happened to the second and third brothers . It happened right on down to the seventh brother .
40022027	Finally , the woman died .
40022028	Now then , when the dead rise , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them were married to her . "
40022029	Jesus replied , " You are mistaken , because you do not know the Scriptures . And you do not know the power of God .
40022030	When the dead rise , they won't get married . And their parents won't give them to be married . They will be like the angels in heaven .
40022031	" What about the dead rising ? Haven't you read what God said to you ?
40022032	He said , ' I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob . ' He is not the God of the dead . He is the God of the living . "
40022033	When the crowds heard this , they were amazed by what he taught .
40022034	The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees weren't able to answer Jesus . So the Pharisees got together .
40022035	One of them was an authority on the law . So he tested Jesus with a question .
40022036	" Teacher , " he asked , " which is the most important commandment in the Law ? "
40022037	Jesus replied , " ' Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Love him with all your mind . '
40022038	This is the first and most important commandment .
40022039	And the second is like it . ' Love your neighbor as you love yourself . '
40022040	Everything that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments . "
40022041	The Pharisees were gathered together . Jesus asked them ,
40022042	" What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? " " The son of David , " they replied .
40022043	He said to them , " Then why does David call him ' Lord ' ? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself . David said ,
40022044	" ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control . " '
40022045	So if David calls him ' Lord , ' how can he be David's son ? "
40022046	No one could answer him with a single word . From that day on , no one dared to ask him any more questions .
40023001	Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples .
40023002	" The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat , " he said .
40023003	" So you must obey them . Do everything they tell you . But don't do what they do . They don't practice what they preach .
40023004	They tie up heavy loads and put them on other people's shoulders . But they themselves aren't willing to lift a finger to move them .
40023005	" Everything they do is done for others to see . On their foreheads and arms they wear little boxes that hold Scripture verses . They make the boxes very wide . And they make the tassels on their coats very long .
40023006	" They love to sit down in the place of honor at dinners . They also love to have the most important seats in the synagogues .
40023007	They love to be greeted in the market places . They love it when people call them ' Rabbi . '
40023008	" But you shouldn't be called ' Rabbi . ' You have only one Master , and you are all brothers .
40023009	Do not call anyone on earth ' father . ' You have one Father , and he is in heaven .
40023010	You shouldn't be called ' teacher . ' You have one Teacher , and he is the Christ .
40023011	The most important person among you will be your servant .
40023012	Anyone who lifts himself up will be brought down . And anyone who is brought down will be lifted up .
40023015	" How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You travel everywhere to win one person to your faith . Then you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are .
40023016	" How terrible for you , blind guides ! You say , ' If anyone takes an oath in the name of the temple , it means nothing . But anyone who takes an oath in the name of the gold of the temple must keep the oath . '
40023017	You are blind and foolish ! Which is more important ? Is it the gold ? Or is it the temple that makes the gold holy ?
40023018	" You also say , ' If anyone takes an oath in the name of the altar , it means nothing . But anyone who takes an oath in the name of the gift on it must keep the oath . '
40023019	You blind men ! Which is more important ? Is it the gift ? Or is it the altar that makes the gift holy ?
40023020	" So anyone who takes an oath in the name of the altar takes an oath in the name of it and of everything on it .
40023021	And anyone who takes an oath in the name of the temple takes an oath in the name of it and of the One who lives in it .
40023022	And anyone who takes an oath in the name of heaven takes an oath in the name of God's throne and of the One who sits on it .
40023023	" How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You give God a tenth of your spices , like mint , dill and cummin . But you have not practiced the more important things of the law , like fairness , mercy and faithfulness . You should have practiced the last things without failing to do the first .
40023024	You blind guides ! You remove the smallest insect from your food . But you swallow a whole camel !
40023025	" How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You clean the outside of the cup and dish . But on the inside you are full of greed . You only want to satisfy yourselves .
40023026	Blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and dish . Then the outside will also be clean .
40023027	" How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You are like tombs that are painted white . They look beautiful on the outside . But on the inside they are full of the bones of the dead . They are also full of other things that are not pure and clean .
40023028	It is the same with you . On the outside you seem to be doing what is right . But on the inside you are full of what is wrong . You pretend to be what you are not .
40023029	" How terrible for you , teachers of the law and Pharisees ! You pretenders ! You build tombs for the prophets . You decorate the graves of the godly .
40023030	And you say , ' If we had lived in the days of those who lived before us , we wouldn't have done what they did . We wouldn't have helped to kill the prophets . '
40023031	So you give witness against yourselves . You admit that you are the children of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	So finish the sins that those who lived before you started !
40023033	" You nest of poisonous snakes ! How will you escape from being sentenced to hell ?
40023034	So I am sending you prophets , wise men , and teachers . You will kill some of them . You will nail some to a cross . Others you will whip in your synagogues . You will chase them from town to town .
40023035	" So you will pay for all the godly people's blood spilled on earth . I mean from the blood of godly Abel to the blood of Zechariah , the son of Berekiah . Zechariah was the one you murdered between the temple and the altar .
40023036	What I'm about to tell you is true . All this will happen to those who are now living .
40023037	" Jerusalem ! Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and throw stones in order to kill those who are sent to you . Many times I have wanted to gather your people together . I have wanted to be like a hen who gathers her chicks under her wings . But you would not let me !
40023038	Look , your house is left empty .
40023039	I tell you , you will not see me again until you say , ' Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord . ' "
40024001	Jesus left the temple . He was walking away when his disciples came up to him . They wanted to call his attention to the temple buildings .
40024002	" Do you see all these things ? " Jesus asked . " What I'm about to tell you is true . Not one stone here will be left on top of another . Every stone will be thrown down . "
40024003	Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives . There the disciples came to him in private . " Tell us , " they said . " When will this happen ? And what will be the sign of your coming ? What will be the sign of the end ? "
40024004	Jesus answered , " Keep watch ! Be careful that no one fools you .
40024005	Many will come in my name . They will claim , ' I am the Christ ! ' They will fool many people .
40024006	" You will hear about wars . You will also hear people talking about future wars . Don't be alarmed . Those things must happen . But the end still isn't here .
40024007	Nation will fight against nation . Kingdom will fight against kingdom . People will go hungry . There will be earthquakes in many places .
40024008	All these are the beginning of birth pains .
40024009	" Then people will hand you over to be treated badly and killed . All nations will hate you because of me .
40024010	At that time , many will turn away from their faith . They will hate each other . They will hand each other over to their enemies .
40024011	Many false prophets will appear . They will fool many people .
40024012	Because evil will grow , most people's love will grow cold .
40024013	But the one who stands firm to the end will be saved .
40024014	This good news of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world . It will be a witness to all nations . Then the end will come .
40024015	" The prophet Daniel spoke about ' the hated thing that destroys . ' Someday you will see it standing in the holy place . The reader should understand this .
40024016	Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains .
40024017	No one on the roof should go down into his house to take anything out .
40024018	No one in the field should go back to get his coat .
40024019	How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women ! How awful for nursing mothers !
40024020	Pray that you will not have to escape in winter or on the Sabbath day .
40024021	There will be terrible suffering in those days . It will be worse than any other from the beginning of the world until now . And there will never be anything like it again .
40024022	If the time had not been cut short , no one would live . But because of God's chosen people , it will be shortened .
40024023	" At that time someone may say to you , ' Look ! Here is the Christ ! ' Or , ' There he is ! ' Do not believe it .
40024024	False Christs and false prophets will appear . They will do great signs and miracles . They will try to fool God's chosen people if possible .
40024025	See , I have told you ahead of time .
40024026	" So if anyone tells you , ' He is far out in the desert , ' do not go out there . Or if anyone says , ' He is deep inside the house , ' do not believe it .
40024027	Lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west . It will be the same when the Son of Man comes .
40024028	The vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body .
40024029	" Right after the terrible suffering of those days , " ' The sun will be darkened . The moon will not shine . The stars will fall from the sky . The heavenly bodies will be shaken . '
40024030	" At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky . All the nations on earth will be sad . They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky . He will come with power and great glory .
40024031	He will send his angels with a loud trumpet call . They will gather his chosen people from all four directions . They will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other .
40024032	" Learn a lesson from the fig tree . As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out , you know that summer is near .
40024033	In the same way , when you see all those things happening , you know that the end is near . It is right at the door .
40024034	What I'm about to tell you is true . The people living at that time will certainly not pass away until all those things have happened .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away . But my words will never pass away .
40024036	" No one knows about that day or hour . Not even the angels in heaven know . The Son does not know . Only the Father knows .
40024037	" Remember how it was in the days of Noah . It will be the same when the Son of Man comes .
40024038	" In the days before the flood , people were eating and drinking . They were getting married . They were giving their daughters to be married . They did all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark .
40024039	They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away . That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes .
40024040	" Two men will be in the field . One will be taken and the other left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding with a hand mill . One will be taken and the other left .
40024042	" So keep watch . You do not know on what day your Lord will come .
40024043	You must understand something . Suppose the owner of the house knew what time of night the robber was coming . Then he would have kept watch . He would not have let his house be broken into .
40024044	So you also must be ready . The Son of Man will come at an hour when you don't expect him .
40024045	" Suppose a master puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house . The servant's job is to give them their food at the right time . The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this .
40024046	It will be good for the servant if the master finds him doing his job when the master returns .
40024047	What I'm about to tell you is true . The master will put that servant in charge of everything he owns .
40024048	" But suppose that servant is evil . Suppose he says to himself , ' My master is staying away a long time . '
40024049	Suppose he begins to beat the other servants . And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink too much .
40024050	The master of that servant will come back on a day the servant doesn't expect him . He will return at an hour the servant does not know .
40024051	Then the master will cut him to pieces . He will send him to the place where pretenders go . There people will sob and grind their teeth .
40025001	" Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time . Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went out to meet the groom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish . Five were wise .
40025003	The foolish ones took their lamps but didn't take any olive oil with them .
40025004	The wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps .
40025005	The groom did not come for a long time . So the bridesmaids all grew tired and fell asleep .
40025006	" At midnight someone cried out , ' Here's the groom ! Come out to meet him ! '
40025007	" Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready .
40025008	The foolish ones said to the wise ones , ' Give us some of your oil . Our lamps are going out . '
40025009	" ' No , ' they replied . ' There may not be enough for all of us . Instead , go to those who sell oil . Buy some for yourselves . '
40025010	" So they went to buy the oil . But while they were on their way , the groom arrived . The bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner . Then the door was shut .
40025011	" Later , the other bridesmaids also came . ' Sir ! Sir ! ' they said . ' Open the door for us ! '
40025012	" But he replied , ' What I'm about to tell you is true . I don't know you . '
40025013	" So keep watch . You do not know the day or the hour that the groom will come .
40025014	" Again , here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like . A man was going on a journey . He sent for his servants and put them in charge of his property .
40025015	He gave $ 10,000 to one . He gave $ 4,000 to another . And he gave $ 2,000 to the third . The man gave each servant the amount of money he knew the servant could take care of . Then he went on his journey .
40025016	" The servant who had received the $ 10,000 went at once and put his money to work . He earned $ 10,000 more .
40025017	The one with the $ 4,000 earned $ 4,000 more .
40025018	But the man who had received $ 2,000 went and dug a hole in the ground . He hid his master's money in it .
40025019	" After a long time the master of those servants returned . He wanted to collect all the money they had earned .
40025020	The man who had received $ 10,000 brought the other $ 10,000 . ' Master , ' he said , ' you trusted me with $ 10,000 . See , I have earned $ 10,000 more . '
40025021	" His master replied , ' You have done well , good and faithful servant ! You have been faithful with a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Come and share your master's happiness ! '
40025022	" The man with $ 4,000 also came . ' Master , ' he said , ' you trusted me with $ 4,000 . See , I have earned $ 4,000 more . '
40025023	" His master replied , ' You have done well , good and faithful servant ! You have been faithful with a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Come and share your master's happiness ! '
40025024	" Then the man who had received $ 2,000 came . ' Master , ' he said , ' I knew that you are a hard man . You harvest where you have not planted . You gather crops where you have not scattered seed .
40025025	So I was afraid . I went out and hid your $ 2,000 in the ground . See , here is what belongs to you . '
40025026	" His master replied , ' You evil , lazy servant ! So you knew that I harvest where I have not planted ? You knew that I gather crops where I have not scattered seed ?
40025027	Well then , you should have put my money in the bank . When I returned , I would have received it back with interest . '
40025028	" Then his master commanded the other servants , ' Take the $ 2,000 from him . Give it to the one who has $ 20,000 .
40025029	Everyone who has will be given more . He will have more than enough . And what about anyone who doesn't have ? Even what he has will be taken away from him .
40025030	Throw that worthless servant outside . There in the darkness , people will sob and grind their teeth . '
40025031	" The Son of Man will come in all his glory . All the angels will come with him . Then he will sit on his throne in the glory of heaven .
40025032	All the nations will be gathered in front of him . He will separate the people into two groups . He will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	He will put the sheep to his right and the goats to his left .
40025034	" Then the King will speak to those on his right . He will say , ' My Father has blessed you . Come and take what is yours . It is the kingdom prepared for you since the world was created .
40025035	I was hungry . And you gave me something to eat . I was thirsty . And you gave me something to drink . I was a stranger . And you invited me in .
40025036	I needed clothes . And you gave them to me . I was sick . And you took care of me . I was in prison . And you came to visit me . '
40025037	" Then the people who have done what is right will answer him . ' Lord , ' they will ask , ' when did we see you hungry and feed you ? When did we see you thirsty and give you something to drink ?
40025038	When did we see you as a stranger and invite you in ? When did we see you needing clothes and give them to you ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you ? '
40025040	" The King will reply , ' What I'm about to tell you is true . Anything you did for one of the least important of these brothers of mine , you did for me . '
40025041	" Then he will say to those on his left , ' You are cursed ! Go away from me into the fire that burns forever . It has been prepared for the devil and his angels .
40025042	I was hungry . But you gave me nothing to eat . I was thirsty . But you gave me nothing to drink .
40025043	I was a stranger . But you did not invite me in . I needed clothes . But you did not give me any . I was sick and in prison . But you did not take care of me . '
40025044	" They also will answer , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you ? When did we see you as a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and not help you ? '
40025045	" He will reply , ' What I'm about to tell you is true . Anything you didn't do for one of the least important of these , you didn't do for me . '
40025046	" Then they will go away to be punished forever . But those who have done what is right will receive eternal life . "
40026001	Jesus finished saying all these things . Then he said to his disciples ,
40026002	" As you know , the Passover Feast is two days away . The Son of Man will be handed over to be nailed to a cross . "
40026003	Then the chief priests met with the elders of the people . They met in the palace of Caiaphas , the high priest .
40026004	They made plans to arrest Jesus in a clever way . They wanted to kill him .
40026005	" But not during the Feast , " they said . " The people may stir up trouble . "
40026006	Jesus was in Bethany . He was in the home of a man named Simon , who had a skin disease .
40026007	A woman came to Jesus with a special sealed jar of very expensive perfume . She poured the perfume on his head while he was at the table .
40026008	When the disciples saw this , they became angry . " Why this waste ? " they asked .
40026009	" The perfume could have been sold at a high price . The money could have been given to poor people . "
40026010	Jesus was aware of this . So he said to them , " Why are you bothering this woman ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
40026011	You will always have poor people with you . But you will not always have me .
40026012	She poured the perfume on my body to prepare me to be buried .
40026013	What I'm about to tell you is true . What she has done will be told anywhere this good news is preached all over the world . It will be told in memory of her . "
40026014	One of the Twelve went to the chief priests . His name was Judas Iscariot .
40026015	He asked , " What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you ? " So they counted out 30 silver coins for him .
40026016	From then on , Judas watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them .
40026017	It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread . The disciples came to Jesus . They asked , " Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? "
40026018	He replied , " Go into the city to a certain man . Tell him , ' The Teacher says , " My time is near . I am going to celebrate the Passover at your house with my disciples . " ' "
40026019	So the disciples did what Jesus had told them to do . They prepared the Passover meal .
40026020	When evening came , Jesus was at the table with the Twelve .
40026021	While they were eating , he said , " What I'm about to tell you is true . One of you will hand me over to my enemies . "
40026022	The disciples became very sad . One after the other , they began to say to him , " It's not I , Lord , is it ? "
40026023	Jesus replied , " The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will hand me over .
40026024	The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him . But how terrible it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born . "
40026025	Judas was the one who was going to hand him over . He said , " It's not I , Rabbi , is it ? " Jesus answered , " Yes . It is you . "
40026026	While they were eating , Jesus took bread . He gave thanks and broke it . He handed it to his disciples and said , " Take this and eat it . This is my body . "
40026027	Then he took the cup . He gave thanks and handed it to them . He said , " All of you drink from it .
40026028	This is my blood of the new covenant . It is poured out to forgive the sins of many .
40026029	Here is what I tell you . From now on , I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom . "
40026030	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Jesus told them , " This very night you will all turn away because of me . It is written that the Lord said , " ' I will strike the shepherd down . Then the sheep of the flock will be scattered . '
40026032	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee . "
40026033	Peter replied , " All the others may turn away because of you . But I never will . "
40026034	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " Jesus answered . " It will happen this very night . Before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don't know me . "
40026035	But Peter said , " I may have to die with you . But I will never say I don't know you . " And all the other disciples said the same thing .
40026036	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane . He said to them , " Sit here while I go over there and pray . "
40026037	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him . He began to be sad and troubled .
40026038	Then he said to them , " My soul is very sad . I feel close to death . Stay here . Keep watch with me . "
40026039	He went a little farther . Then he fell with his face to the ground . He prayed , " My Father , if it is possible , take this cup of suffering away from me . But let what you want be done , not what I want . "
40026040	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . " Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour ? " he asked Peter .
40026041	" Watch and pray . Then you won't fall into sin when you are tempted . The spirit is willing . But the body is weak . "
40026042	Jesus went away a second time . He prayed , " My Father , is it possible for this cup to be taken away ? But if I must drink it , may what you want be done . "
40026043	Then he came back . Again he found them sleeping . They couldn't keep their eyes open .
40026044	So he left them and went away once more . For the third time he prayed the same thing .
40026045	Then he returned to the disciples . He said to them , " Are you still sleeping and resting ? Look ! The hour is near . The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners .
40026046	Get up ! Let us go ! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them ! "
40026047	While Jesus was still speaking , Judas arrived . He was one of the Twelve . A large crowd was with him . They were carrying swords and clubs . The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them .
40026048	Judas , who was going to hand Jesus over , had arranged a signal with them . " The one I kiss is the man , " he said . " Arrest him . "
40026049	So Judas went to Jesus at once . He said , " Greetings , Rabbi ! " And he kissed him .
40026050	Jesus replied , " Friend , do what you came to do . " Then the men stepped forward . They grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
40026051	At that moment , one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword . He pulled it out and struck the servant of the high priest with it . He cut off the servant's ear .
40026052	" Put your sword back in its place , " Jesus said to him . " All who use the sword will die by the sword .
40026053	Do you think I can't ask my Father for help ? He would send an army of more than 70,000 angels right away .
40026054	But then how would the Scriptures come true ? They say it must happen in this way . "
40026055	At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd . " Am I leading a band of armed men against you ? " he asked . " Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me ? Every day I sat in the temple courtyard teaching . And you didn't arrest me .
40026056	But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets would come true . " Then all the disciples left him and ran away .
40026057	Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas , the high priest . The teachers of the law and the elders had come together there .
40026058	Not too far away , Peter followed Jesus . He went right up to the courtyard of the high priest . He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen .
40026059	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus . They wanted to put him to death .
40026060	But they did not find any proof , even though many false witnesses came forward . Finally , two other witnesses came forward .
40026061	They said , " This fellow claimed , ' I am able to destroy the temple of God . I can build it again in three days . ' "
40026062	Then the high priest stood up . He asked Jesus , " Aren't you going to answer ? What are these charges that these men are bringing against you ? "
40026063	But Jesus remained silent . The high priest said to him , " I command you under oath by the living God . Tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God . "
40026064	" Yes . It is just as you say , " Jesus replied . " But here is what I say to all of you . In days to come , you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One . You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven . "
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothes . He said , " He has spoken a very evil thing against God ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? You have heard him say this evil thing .
40026066	What do you think ? " " He must die ! " they answered .
40026067	Then they spit in his face . They hit him with their fists . Others slapped him .
40026068	They said , " Prophesy to us , Christ ! Who hit you ? "
40026069	Peter was sitting out in the courtyard . A female servant came to him . " You also were with Jesus of Galilee , " she said .
40026070	But in front of all of them , Peter said he was not . " I don't know what you're talking about , " he said .
40026071	Then he went out to the gate leading into the courtyard . There another woman saw him . She said to the people , " This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth . "
40026072	Again he said he was not . With an oath he said , " I don't know the man ! "
40026073	After a little while , those standing there went up to Peter . " You must be one of them , " they said . " The way you talk gives you away . "
40026074	Then Peter began to call down curses on himself . He took an oath and said to them , " I don't know the man ! " Right away a rooster crowed .
40026075	Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said . " The rooster will crow , " Jesus had told him . " Before it does , you will say three times that you don't know me . " Peter went outside . He broke down and sobbed .
40027001	It was early in the morning . All the chief priests and the elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death .
40027002	They tied him up and led him away . Then they handed him over to Pilate , who was the governor .
40027003	Judas , who had handed him over , saw that Jesus had been sentenced to die . He felt deep shame and sadness for what he had done . So he returned the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and the elders .
40027004	" I have sinned , " he said . " I handed over a man who is not guilty . " " What do we care ? " they replied . " That's your problem . "
40027005	So Judas threw the money into the temple and left . Then he went away and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests picked up the coins . They said , " It's against the law to put this money into the temple fund . It is blood money . It has paid for a man's death . "
40027007	So they decided to use the money to buy a potter's field . People from other countries would be buried there .
40027008	That is why it has been called The Field of Blood to this very day .
40027009	Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true . He had said , " They took the 30 silver coins . That price was set for him by the people of Israel .
40027010	They used the coins to buy a potter's field , just as the Lord commanded me . "
40027011	Jesus was standing in front of the governor . The governor asked him , " Are you the king of the Jews ? " " Yes . It is just as you say , " Jesus replied .
40027012	But when the chief priests and the elders brought charges against him , he did not answer .
40027013	Then Pilate asked him , " Don't you hear the charges they are bringing against you ? "
40027014	But Jesus made no reply , not even to a single charge . The governor was really amazed .
40027015	It was the governor's practice at the Passover Feast to let one prisoner go free . The people could choose the one they wanted .
40027016	At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas .
40027017	So when the crowd gathered , Pilate asked them , " Which one do you want me to set free ? Barabbas ? Or Jesus who is called Christ ? "
40027018	Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous . He knew this was why they had handed Jesus over to him .
40027019	While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat , his wife sent him a message . It said , " Don't have anything to do with that man . He is not guilty . I have suffered a great deal in a dream today because of him . "
40027020	But the chief priests and the elders talked the crowd into asking for Barabbas and having Jesus put to death .
40027021	" Which of the two do you want me to set free ? " asked the governor . " Barabbas , " they answered .
40027022	" Then what should I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? " Pilate asked . They all answered , " Crucify him ! "
40027023	" Why ? What wrong has he done ? " asked Pilate . But they shouted even louder , " Crucify him ! "
40027024	Pilate saw that he wasn't getting anywhere . Instead , the crowd was starting to get angry . So he took water and washed his hands in front of them . " I am not guilty of this man's death , " he said . " You are accountable for that ! "
40027025	All the people answered , " We and our children will accept the guilt for his death ! "
40027026	Pilate let Barabbas go free . But he had Jesus whipped . Then he handed him over to be nailed to a cross .
40027027	The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace , which was called the Praetorium . All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him .
40027028	They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him .
40027029	Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown . They placed it on his head . They put a stick in his right hand . Then they fell on their knees in front of him and made fun of him . " We honor you , king of the Jews ! " they said .
40027030	They spit on him . They hit him on the head with the stick again and again .
40027031	After they had made fun of him , they took off the robe . They put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him away to nail him to a cross .
40027032	On their way out of the city , they met a man from Cyrene . His name was Simon . They forced him to carry the cross .
40027033	They came to a place called Golgotha . The word Golgotha means The Place of the Skull .
40027034	There they mixed wine with bitter spices and gave it to Jesus to drink . After tasting it , he refused to drink it .
40027035	When they had nailed him to the cross , they divided up his clothes by casting lots .
40027036	They sat down and kept watch over him there .
40027037	Above his head they placed the written charge against him . It read , this is jesus , the king of the jews .
40027038	Two robbers were crucified with him . One was on his right and one was on his left .
40027039	Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and made fun of him . They shook their heads
40027040	and said , " So you are going to destroy the temple and build it again in three days ? Then save yourself ! Come down from the cross , if you are the Son of God ! "
40027041	In the same way the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the elders made fun of him .
40027042	" He saved others , " they said . " But he can't save himself ! He's the King of Israel ! Let him come down now from the cross ! Then we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusts in God . Let God rescue him now if he wants him . He's the one who said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
40027044	In the same way the robbers who were being crucified with Jesus also made fun of him .
40027045	From noon until three o'clock , the whole land was covered with darkness .
40027046	About three o'clock , Jesus cried out in a loud voice . He said , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " This means " My God , my God , why have you deserted me ? "
40027047	Some of those standing there heard Jesus cry out . They said , " He's calling for Elijah . "
40027048	Right away one of them ran and got a sponge . He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick . He offered it to Jesus to drink .
40027049	The rest said , " Leave him alone . Let's see if Elijah comes to save him . "
40027050	After Jesus cried out again in a loud voice , he died .
40027051	At that moment the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook . The rocks split .
40027052	Tombs broke open . The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life .
40027053	They came out of the tombs . After Jesus was raised to life , they went into the holy city . There they appeared to many people .
40027054	The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened . They were terrified . They exclaimed , " He was surely the Son of God ! "
40027055	Not very far away , many women were watching . They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs .
40027056	Mary Magdalene was among them . Mary , the mother of James and Joses , was also there . So was the mother of Zebedee's sons .
40027057	As evening approached , a rich man came from the town of Arimathea . His name was Joseph . He had become a follower of Jesus .
40027058	He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body . Pilate ordered that it be given to him .
40027059	Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth .
40027060	He placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock . He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb . Then he went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there across from the tomb .
40027062	The next day was the day after Preparation Day . The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate .
40027063	" Sir , " they said , " we remember something that liar said while he was still alive . He claimed , ' After three days I will rise again . '
40027064	So give the order to make the tomb secure until the third day . If you don't , his disciples might come and steal the body . Then they will tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead . This last lie will be worse than the first . "
40027065	" Take some guards with you , " Pilate answered . " Go . Make the tomb as secure as you can . "
40027066	So they went and made the tomb secure . They put a seal on the stone and placed some guards on duty .
40028001	The Sabbath day was now over . It was dawn on the first day of the week . Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb .
40028002	There was a powerful earthquake . An angel of the Lord came down from heaven . The angel went to the tomb . He rolled back the stone and sat on it .
40028003	His body shone like lightning . His clothes were as white as snow .
40028004	The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men .
40028005	The angel said to the women , " Don't be afraid . I know that you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here ! He has risen , just as he said he would ! Come and see the place where he was lying .
40028007	Go quickly ! Tell his disciples , ' He has risen from the dead . He is going ahead of you into Galilee . There you will see him . ' Now I have told you . "
40028008	So the women hurried away from the tomb . They were afraid , but they were filled with joy . They ran to tell the disciples .
40028009	Suddenly Jesus met them . " Greetings ! " he said . They came to him , took hold of his feet and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , " Don't be afraid . Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee . There they will see me . "
40028011	While the women were on their way , some of the guards went into the city . They reported to the chief priests all that had happened .
40028012	When the chief priests met with the elders , they came up with a plan . They gave the soldiers a large amount of money .
40028013	They told the soldiers , " We want you to say , ' His disciples came during the night . They stole his body while we were sleeping . '
40028014	If the governor hears this report , we will pay him off . That will keep you out of trouble . "
40028015	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told . This story has spread all around among the Jews to this very day .
40028016	Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee . They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go .
40028017	When they saw him , they worshiped him . But some still had their doubts .
40028018	Then Jesus came to them . He said , " All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
40028019	So you must go and make disciples of all nations . Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit .
40028020	Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you . And you can be sure that I am always with you , to the very end . "
41001001	This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	Long ago Isaiah the prophet wrote , " I will send my messenger ahead of you . He will prepare your way . "
41001003	" A messenger is calling out in the desert , ' Prepare the way for the Lord . Make straight paths for him . ' "
41001004	And so John came . He baptized people in the desert . He also preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins . Then God would forgive them .
41001005	All the people from the countryside of Judea went out to him . All the people from Jerusalem went too . When they admitted they had sinned , John baptized them in the Jordan River .
41001006	John wore clothes made out of camel's hair . He had a leather belt around his waist . And he ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	Here is what John was preaching . " After me , one will come who is more powerful than I am . I'm not good enough to bend down and untie his sandals .
41001008	I baptize you with water . But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . "
41001009	At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee . John baptized him in the Jordan River .
41001010	Jesus was coming up out of the water . Just then he saw heaven being torn open . He saw the Holy Spirit coming down on him like a dove .
41001011	A voice spoke to him from heaven . It said , " You are my Son , and I love you . I am very pleased with you . "
41001012	At once the Holy Spirit sent Jesus out into the desert .
41001013	He was in the desert 40 days . There Satan tempted him . The wild animals didn't harm Jesus . Angels took care of him .
41001014	After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee . He preached God's good news .
41001015	" The time has come , " he said . " The kingdom of God is near . Turn away from your sins and believe the good news ! "
41001016	One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee . There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew . They were throwing a net into the lake . They were fishermen .
41001017	" Come . Follow me , " Jesus said . " I will make you fishers of people . "
41001018	At once they left their nets and followed him .
41001019	Then Jesus walked a little farther . As he did , he saw James , son of Zebedee , and his brother John . They were in a boat preparing their nets .
41001020	Right away he called out to them . They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men . Then they followed Jesus .
41001021	Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum . When the Sabbath day came , he went into the synagogue . There he began to teach .
41001022	The people were amazed at his teaching . He taught them like one who had authority . He did not talk like the teachers of the law .
41001023	Just then a man in their synagogue cried out . He was controlled by an evil spirit . He said ,
41001024	" What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the Holy One of God ! "
41001025	" Be quiet ! " said Jesus firmly . " Come out of him ! "
41001026	The evil spirit shook the man wildly . Then it came out of him with a scream .
41001027	All the people were amazed . So they asked each other , " What is this ? A new teaching ! And with so much authority ! He even gives orders to evil spirits , and they obey him . "
41001028	News about Jesus spread quickly all over Galilee .
41001029	Jesus and those with him left the synagogue . Right away they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed . She had a fever . They told Jesus about her .
41001031	So he went to her . He took her hand and helped her up . The fever left her . Then she began to serve them .
41001032	That evening after sunset , the people brought to Jesus all who were sick . They also brought all who were controlled by demons .
41001033	All the people in town gathered at the door .
41001034	Jesus healed many of them . They had all kinds of sicknesses . He also drove out many demons . But he would not let the demons speak , because they knew who he was .
41001035	It was very early in the morning and still dark . Jesus got up and left the house . He went to a place where he could be alone . There he prayed .
41001036	Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus .
41001037	When they found him , they called out , " Everyone is looking for you ! "
41001038	Jesus replied , " Let's go somewhere else . I want to go to the nearby towns . I must preach there also . That is why I have come . "
41001039	So he traveled all around Galilee . He preached in their synagogues . He also drove out demons .
41001040	A man who had a skin disease came to Jesus . On his knees he begged Jesus . He said , " If you are willing to make me ' clean , ' you can do it . "
41001041	Jesus was filled with deep concern . He reached out his hand and touched the man . " I am willing to do it , " he said . " Be ' clean ' ! "
41001042	Right away the disease left him . He was healed .
41001043	Jesus sent him away at once . He gave the man a strong warning .
41001044	" Don't tell this to anyone , " he said . " Go and show yourself to the priest . Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded . It will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are ' clean . ' "
41001045	But the man went out and started talking right away . He spread the news to everyone . So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly . He stayed outside in lonely places . But people still came to him from everywhere .
41002001	A few days later , Jesus entered Capernaum again . The people heard that he had come home .
41002002	So many people gathered that there was no room left . There was not even room outside the door . And Jesus preached the word to them .
41002003	Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk .
41002004	But they could not get him close to Jesus because of the crowd . So they made a hole in the roof above Jesus . Then they lowered the man through it on a mat .
41002005	Jesus saw their faith . So he said to the man , " Son , your sins are forgiven . "
41002006	Some teachers of the law were sitting there . They were thinking ,
41002007	" Why is this fellow talking like that ? He's saying a very evil thing ! Only God can forgive sins ! "
41002008	Right away Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said to them , " Why are you thinking these things ?
41002009	Is it easier to say to this man , ' Your sins are forgiven ' ? Or to say , ' Get up , take your mat and walk ' ?
41002010	I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . " Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk .
41002011	" I tell you , " he said , " get up . Take your mat and go home . "
41002012	The man got up and took his mat . Then he walked away while everyone watched . All the people were amazed . They praised God and said , " We have never seen anything like this ! "
41002013	Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee . A large crowd came to him . He began to teach them .
41002014	As he walked along he saw Levi , son of Alphaeus . Levi was sitting at the tax collector's booth . " Follow me , " Jesus told him . Levi got up and followed him .
41002015	Later Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house . Many tax collectors and " sinners " were eating with him and his disciples . They were part of the large crowd following Jesus .
41002016	Some teachers of the law who were Pharisees were there . They saw Jesus eating with " sinners " and tax collectors . So they asked his disciples , " Why does he eat with tax collectors and ' sinners' ? "
41002017	Jesus heard that . So he said to them , " Those who are healthy don't need a doctor . Sick people do . I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me . I have come to get sinners to follow me . "
41002018	John's disciples and the Pharisees were going without eating . Some people came to Jesus . They said to him , " John's disciples are fasting . The disciples of the Pharisees are also fasting . But your disciples are not . Why aren't they ? "
41002019	Jesus answered , " How can the guests of the groom go without eating while he is with them ? They will not fast as long as he is with them .
41002020	But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . On that day they will go without eating .
41002021	" People don't sew a patch of new cloth on old clothes . If they do , the new piece will pull away from the old . That will make the tear worse .
41002022	People don't pour new wine into old wineskins . If they do , the wine will burst the skins . Then the wine and the wineskins will both be destroyed . No , everyone pours new wine into new wineskins . "
41002023	One Sabbath day Jesus was walking with his disciples through the grainfields . The disciples began to break off some heads of grain .
41002024	The Pharisees said to Jesus , " Look ! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath . Why are your disciples doing it ? "
41002025	He answered , " Haven't you ever read about what David did ? He and his men were hungry . They needed food .
41002026	It was when Abiathar was high priest . David entered the house of God and ate the holy bread . Only priests were allowed to eat it . David also gave some to his men . "
41002027	Then Jesus said to them , " The Sabbath day was made for man . Man was not made for the Sabbath day .
41002028	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day . "
41003001	Another time Jesus went into the synagogue . A man with a weak and twisted hand was there .
41003002	Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus . They watched him closely . They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day .
41003003	Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and twisted hand . " Stand up in front of everyone , " he said .
41003004	Then Jesus asked them , " What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath day ? Should we do good ? Or should we do evil ? Should we save life ? Or should we kill ? " But no one answered .
41003005	Jesus looked around at them in anger . He was very upset because their hearts were stubborn . Then he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He stretched it out , and his hand was as good as new .
41003006	Then the Pharisees went out and began to make plans with the Herodians . They wanted to kill Jesus .
41003007	Jesus went off to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples . A large crowd from Galilee followed .
41003008	People heard about all that Jesus was doing . And many came to him . They came from Judea , Jerusalem , and Idumea . They came from the lands east of the Jordan River . And they came from the area around Tyre and Sidon .
41003009	Because of the crowd , Jesus told his disciples to get a small boat ready for him . This would keep the people from crowding him .
41003010	Jesus had healed many people . So those who were sick were pushing forward to touch him .
41003011	When people with evil spirits saw him , they fell down in front of him . The spirits shouted , " You are the Son of God ! "
41003012	But Jesus ordered them not to tell who he was .
41003013	Jesus went up on a mountainside . He called for certain people to come to him , and they came .
41003014	He appointed 12 of them and called them apostles . From that time on they would be with him . He would also send them out to preach .
41003015	They would have authority to drive out demons .
41003016	So Jesus appointed the Twelve . Simon was one of them . Jesus gave him the name Peter .
41003017	There were James , son of Zebedee , and his brother John . Jesus gave them the name Boanerges . Boanerges means Sons of Thunder .
41003018	There were also Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , and James , son of Alphaeus . And there were Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot .
41003019	Judas Iscariot was one of them too . He was the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies .
41003020	Jesus entered a house . Again a crowd gathered . It was so large that Jesus and his disciples were not even able to eat .
41003021	His family heard about this . So they went to take charge of him . They said , " He is out of his mind . "
41003022	Some teachers of the law were there . They had come down from Jerusalem . They said , " He is controlled by Beelzebub ! He is driving out demons by the power of the prince of demons . "
41003023	So Jesus called them over and spoke to them by using stories . He said , " How can Satan drive out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom fights against itself , it can't stand .
41003025	If a family is divided , it can't stand .
41003026	And if Satan fights against himself , and his helpers are divided , he can't stand . That is the end of him .
41003027	In fact , none of you can enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns . You must first tie him up . Then you can rob his house .
41003028	" What I'm about to tell you is true . Everyone's sins and evil words against God will be forgiven .
41003029	But anyone who speaks evil things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven . His guilt will last forever . "
41003030	Jesus said this because the teachers of the law were saying , " He has an evil spirit . "
41003031	Jesus' mother and brothers came and stood outside . They sent someone in to get him .
41003032	A crowd was sitting around Jesus . They told him , " Your mother and your brothers are outside . They are looking for you . "
41003033	" Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? " he asked .
41003034	Then Jesus looked at the people sitting in a circle around him . He said , " Here is my mother ! Here are my brothers !
41003035	Anyone who does what God wants is my brother or sister or mother . "
41004001	Again Jesus began to teach by the Sea of Galilee . The crowd that gathered around him was very large . So he got into a boat . He sat down in it out on the lake . All the people were along the shore at the water's edge .
41004002	He taught them many things by using stories . In his teaching he said ,
41004003	" Listen ! A farmer went out to plant his seed .
41004004	He scattered the seed on the ground . Some fell on a path . Birds came and ate it up .
41004005	Some seed fell on rocky places , where there wasn't much soil . The plants came up quickly , because the soil wasn't deep .
41004006	When the sun came up , it burned the plants . They dried up because they had no roots .
41004007	Other seed fell among thorns . The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants . So the plants did not bear grain .
41004008	Still other seed fell on good soil . It grew up and produced a crop 30 , 60 , or even 100 times more than the farmer planted . "
41004009	Then Jesus said , " Those who have ears should listen . "
41004010	Later Jesus was alone . The Twelve asked him about the stories . So did the others around him .
41004011	He told them , " The secret of God's kingdom has been given to you . But to outsiders everything is told by using stories .
41004012	In that way , " ' They will see but never know what they are seeing . They will hear but never understand . Otherwise they might turn and be forgiven ! ' "
41004013	Then Jesus said to them , " Don't you understand this story ? Then how will you understand any stories of this kind ?
41004014	The seed the farmer plants is God's message .
41004015	What is seed scattered on a path like ? The message is planted . The people hear the message . Then Satan comes . He takes away the message that was planted in them .
41004016	And what is seed scattered on rocky places like ? The people hear the message . At once they receive it with joy .
41004017	But they have no roots . So they last only a short time . They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message .
41004018	And what is seed scattered among thorns like ? The people hear the message .
41004019	But then the worries of this life come to them . Wealth comes with its false promises . The people also long for other things . All of those are the kinds of things that crowd out the message . They keep it from producing fruit .
41004020	And what is seed scattered on good soil like ? The people hear the message . They accept it . They produce a good crop 30 , 60 , or even 100 times more than the farmer planted . "
41004021	Jesus said to them , " Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a large bowl or a bed ? Don't you put it on its stand ?
41004022	What is hidden is meant to be seen . And what is put out of sight is meant to be brought out into the open .
41004023	Everyone who has ears should listen . "
41004024	" Think carefully about what you hear , " he said . " As you give , so you will receive . In fact , you will receive even more .
41004025	If you have something , you will be given more . If you have nothing , even what you have will be taken away from you . "
41004026	Jesus also said , " Here is what God's kingdom is like . A farmer scatters seed on the ground .
41004027	Night and day the seed comes up and grows . It happens whether the farmer sleeps or gets up . He doesn't know how it happens .
41004028	All by itself the soil produces grain . First the stalk comes up . Then the head appears . Finally , the full grain appears in the head .
41004029	Before long the grain ripens . So the farmer cuts it down , because the harvest is ready . "
41004030	Again Jesus said , " What can we say God's kingdom is like ? What story can we use to explain it ?
41004031	It is like a mustard seed , which is the smallest seed planted in the ground .
41004032	But when you plant the seed , it grows . It becomes the largest of all garden plants . Its branches are so big that birds can rest in its shade . "
41004033	Using many stories like those , Jesus spoke the word to them . He told them as much as they could understand .
41004034	He did not say anything to them without using a story . But when he was alone with his disciples , he explained everything .
41004035	When evening came , Jesus said to his disciples , " Let's go over to the other side of the lake . "
41004036	They left the crowd behind . And they took him along in a boat , just as he was . There were also other boats with him .
41004037	A wild storm came up . Waves crashed over the boat . It was about to sink .
41004038	Jesus was in the back , sleeping on a cushion . The disciples woke him up . They said , " Teacher ! Don't you care if we drown ? "
41004039	He got up and ordered the wind to stop . He said to the waves , " Quiet ! Be still ! " Then the wind died down . And it was completely calm .
41004040	He said to his disciples , " Why are you so afraid ? Don't you have any faith at all yet ? "
41004041	They were terrified . They asked each other , " Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! "
41005001	They went across the Sea of Galilee to the area of the Gerasenes .
41005002	Jesus got out of the boat . A man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him .
41005003	The man lived in the tombs . No one could keep him tied up anymore . Not even a chain could hold him .
41005004	His hands and feet had often been chained . But he tore the chains apart . And he broke the iron cuffs on his ankles . No one was strong enough to control him .
41005005	Night and day he screamed among the tombs and in the hills . He cut himself with stones .
41005006	When he saw Jesus a long way off , he ran to him . He fell on his knees in front of him .
41005007	He shouted at the top of his voice , " Jesus , Son of the Most High God , what do you want with me ? Promise before God that you won't hurt me ! "
41005008	This was because Jesus had said to him , " Come out of this man , you evil spirit ! "
41005009	Then Jesus asked the demon , " What is your name ? " " My name is Legion , " he replied . " There are many of us . "
41005010	And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area .
41005011	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside .
41005012	The demons begged Jesus , " Send us among the pigs . Let us go into them . "
41005013	Jesus allowed it . The evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs . There were about 2,000 pigs in the herd . The whole herd rushed down the steep bank . They ran into the lake and drowned .
41005014	Those who were tending the pigs ran off . They told the people in the town and countryside what had happened . The people went out to see for themselves .
41005015	Then they came to Jesus . They saw the man who had been controlled by many demons . He was sitting there . He was now dressed and thinking clearly . All this made the people afraid .
41005016	Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man . They told about the pigs as well .
41005017	Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area .
41005018	Jesus was getting into the boat . The man who had been controlled by demons begged to go with him .
41005019	Jesus did not let him . He said , " Go home to your family . Tell them how much the Lord has done for you . Tell them how kind he has been to you . "
41005020	So the man went away . In the area known as the Ten Cities , he began to tell how much Jesus had done for him . And all the people were amazed .
41005021	Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee in a boat . It landed at the other side . There a large crowd gathered around him .
41005022	Then a man named Jairus came . He was a synagogue ruler . Seeing Jesus , he fell at his feet .
41005023	He begged Jesus , " Please come . My little daughter is dying . Place your hands on her to heal her . Then she will live . "
41005024	So Jesus went with him . A large group of people followed . They crowded around him .
41005025	A woman was there who had a sickness that made her bleed . It had lasted for 12 years .
41005026	She had suffered a great deal , even though she had gone to many doctors . She had spent all the money she had . But she was getting worse , not better .
41005027	Then she heard about Jesus . She came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes .
41005028	She thought , " I just need to touch his clothes . Then I will be healed . "
41005029	Right away her bleeding stopped . She felt in her body that her suffering was over .
41005030	At once Jesus knew that power had gone out from him . He turned around in the crowd . He asked , " Who touched my clothes ? "
41005031	" You see the people , " his disciples answered . " They are crowding against you . And you still ask , ' Who touched me ? ' "
41005032	But Jesus kept looking around . He wanted to see who had touched him .
41005033	Then the woman came and fell at his feet . She knew what had happened to her . She was shaking with fear . But she told him the whole truth .
41005034	He said to her , " Dear woman , your faith has healed you . Go in peace . You are free from your suffering . "
41005035	While Jesus was still speaking , some people came from the house of Jairus . He was the synagogue ruler . " Your daughter is dead , " they said . " Why bother the teacher anymore ? "
41005036	But Jesus didn't listen to them . He told the synagogue ruler , " Don't be afraid . Just believe . "
41005037	He let only Peter , James , and John , the brother of James , follow him .
41005038	They came to the home of the synagogue ruler . There Jesus saw a lot of confusion . People were crying and sobbing loudly .
41005039	He went inside . Then he said to them , " Why all this confusion and sobbing ? The child is not dead . She is only sleeping . "
41005040	But they laughed at him . He made them all go outside . He took only the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him . And he went in where the child was .
41005041	He took her by the hand . Then he said to her , " Talitha koum ! " This means , " Little girl , I say to you , get up ! "
41005042	The girl was 12 years old . Right away she stood up and walked around . They were totally amazed at this .
41005043	Jesus gave strict orders not to let anyone know what had happened . And he told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	Jesus left there and went to his hometown of Nazareth . His disciples went with him .
41006002	When the Sabbath day came , he began to teach in the synagogue . Many who heard him were amazed . " Where did this man get these things ? " they asked . " What's this wisdom that has been given to him ? He even does miracles !
41006003	Isn't this the carpenter ? Isn't this Mary's son ? Isn't this the brother of James , Joseph , Judas and Simon ? Aren't his sisters here with us ? " They were not pleased with him at all .
41006004	Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not honored in his hometown . He doesn't receive any honor among his relatives . And he doesn't receive any in his own home . "
41006005	Jesus laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them . But he could not do any other miracles there .
41006006	He was amazed because they had no faith . Jesus went around teaching from village to village .
41006007	He called the Twelve to him . Then he sent them out two by two . He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits .
41006008	Here were his orders . " Take only a walking stick for your trip . Do not take bread or a bag . Take no money in your belts .
41006009	Wear sandals . But do not take extra clothes .
41006010	When you are invited into a house , stay there until you leave town .
41006011	Some places may not welcome you or listen to you . If they don't , shake the dust off your feet when you leave . That will be a witness against the people living there . "
41006012	They went out . And they preached that people should turn away from their sins .
41006013	They drove out many demons . They poured olive oil on many sick people and healed them .
41006014	King Herod heard about this . Jesus' name had become well known . Some were saying , " John the Baptist has been raised from the dead ! That is why he has the power to do miracles . "
41006015	Others said , " He is Elijah . " Still others claimed , " He is a prophet . He is like one of the prophets of long ago . "
41006016	But when Herod heard this , he said , " I had John's head cut off . And now he has been raised from the dead ! "
41006017	In fact , it was Herod himself who had given orders to arrest John . He had him tied up and put in prison . He did this because of Herodias . She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip . But now Herod was married to her .
41006018	John had been saying to Herod , " It is against the Law for you to have your brother's wife . "
41006019	Herodias held that against John . She wanted to kill him . But she could not ,
41006020	because Herod was afraid of John . So he kept John safe . Herod knew John was a holy man who did what was right . When Herod heard him , he was very puzzled . But he liked to listen to him .
41006021	Finally the right time came . Herod gave a big dinner on his birthday . He invited his high officials and military leaders . He also invited the most important men in Galilee .
41006022	Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced . She pleased Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the girl , " Ask me for anything you want . I'll give it to you . "
41006023	And he promised her with an oath , " Anything you ask for I will give you . I'll give you up to half of my kingdom . "
41006024	She went out and said to her mother , " What should I ask for ? " " The head of John the Baptist , " she answered .
41006025	At once the girl hurried to ask the king . She said , " I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate right now . "
41006026	The king was very upset . But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests . So he did not want to say no to the girl .
41006027	He sent a man right away to bring John's head . The man went to the prison and cut off John's head .
41006028	He brought it back on a big plate . He gave it to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
41006029	John's disciples heard about this . So they came and took his body . Then they placed it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles gathered around Jesus . They told him all they had done and taught .
41006031	But many people were coming and going . So they did not even have a chance to eat . Then Jesus said to his apostles , " Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place . You need to get some rest . "
41006032	So they went away by themselves in a boat to a quiet place .
41006033	But many people who saw them leaving recognized them . They ran from all the towns and got there ahead of them .
41006034	When Jesus came ashore , he saw a large crowd . He felt deep concern for them . They were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began teaching them many things .
41006035	By that time it was late in the day . His disciples came to him . " There is nothing here , " they said . " It's already very late .
41006036	Send the people away . They can go and buy something to eat in the nearby countryside and villages . "
41006037	But Jesus answered , " You give them something to eat . " They said to him , " That would take eight months of a person's pay ! Should we go and spend that much on bread ? Are we supposed to feed them ? "
41006038	" How many loaves do you have ? " Jesus asked . " Go and see . " When they found out , they said , " Five loaves and two fish . "
41006039	Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	So they sat down in groups of 100s and 50s .
41006041	Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and gave thanks . He broke the loaves into pieces . Then he gave them to his disciples to set in front of the people . He also divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	All of them ate and were satisfied .
41006043	The disciples picked up 12 baskets of broken pieces of bread and fish .
41006044	The number of men who had eaten was 5,000 .
41006045	Right away Jesus made his disciples get into the boat . He had them go on ahead of him to Bethsaida . Then he sent the crowd away .
41006046	After leaving them , he went up on a mountainside to pray .
41006047	When evening came , the boat was in the middle of the Sea of Galilee . Jesus was alone on land .
41006048	He saw the disciples pulling hard on the oars . The wind was blowing against them . Early in the morning , he went out to them . He walked on the lake . When he was about to pass by them ,
41006049	they saw him walking on the lake . They thought he was a ghost . They cried out .
41006050	They all saw him and were terrified . Right away he said to them , " Be brave ! It is I . Don't be afraid . "
41006051	Then he climbed into the boat with them . The wind died down . And they were completely amazed .
41006052	They had not understood about the loaves . They were stubborn .
41006053	They crossed over the lake and landed at Gennesaret . There they tied up the boat .
41006054	As soon as Jesus and his disciples got out , people recognized him .
41006055	They ran through that whole area to bring to him those who were sick . They carried them on mats to where they heard he was .
41006056	He went into the villages , the towns and the countryside . Everywhere he went , the people brought the sick to the market places . Those who were sick begged him to let them touch just the edge of his clothes . And all who touched him were healed .
41007001	The Pharisees gathered around Jesus . So did some of the teachers of the law . All of them had come from Jerusalem .
41007002	They saw some of his disciples eating food with " unclean " hands . That means they were not washed .
41007003	The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands to make them pure . That's what the elders teach .
41007004	When they come from the market place , they do not eat unless they wash . And they follow many other teachings . For example , they wash cups , pitchers , and kettles in a special way .
41007005	So the Pharisees and the teachers of the law questioned Jesus . " Why don't your disciples live by what the elders teach ? " they asked . " Why do they eat their food with ' unclean ' hands ? "
41007006	He replied , " Isaiah was right . He prophesied about you people who pretend to be good . He said , " ' These people honor me by what they say . But their hearts are far away from me .
41007007	Their worship doesn't mean anything to me . They teach nothing but human rules . '
41007008	You have let go of God's commands . And you are holding on to the teachings that men have made up . "
41007009	Jesus then said to them , " You have a fine way of setting aside God's commands ! You do this so you can follow your own teachings .
41007010	Moses said , ' Honor your father and mother . ' He also said , ' If anyone calls down a curse on his father or mother , he will be put to death . '
41007011	But you allow people to say to their parents , ' Any help you might have received from us is Corban . '
41007012	So you no longer let them do anything for their parents .
41007013	You make the word of God useless by putting your own teachings in its place . And you do many things like that . "
41007014	Again Jesus called the crowd to him . He said , " Listen to me , everyone . Understand this .
41007017	Then he left the crowd and entered the house . His disciples asked him about this teaching .
41007018	" Don't you understand ? " Jesus asked . " Don't you see ? Nothing that enters people from the outside can make them ' unclean . '
41007019	It doesn't go into the heart . It goes into the stomach . Then it goes out of the body . " In saying this , Jesus was calling all foods " clean . "
41007020	He went on to say , " What comes out of people makes them ' unclean . '
41007021	Evil thoughts come from the inside , from people's hearts . So do sexual sins , stealing and murder . Adultery ,
41007022	greed , hate and cheating come from people's hearts too . So do desires that are not pure , and wanting what belongs to others . And so do telling lies about others and being proud and being foolish .
41007023	All those evil things come from inside a person . They make him ' unclean . ' "
41007024	Jesus went from there to a place near Tyre . He entered a house . He did not want anyone to know where he was . But he could not keep it a secret .
41007025	Soon a woman heard about him . An evil spirit controlled her little daughter . The woman came to Jesus and fell at his feet .
41007026	She was a Greek , born in Syrian Phoenicia . She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	" First let the children eat all they want , " he told her . " It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs . "
41007028	" Yes , Lord , " she replied . " But even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs . "
41007029	Then he told her , " That was a good reply . You may go . The demon has left your daughter . "
41007030	So she went home and found her child lying on the bed . And the demon was gone .
41007031	Then Jesus left the area of Tyre and went through Sidon . He went down to the Sea of Galilee and into the area known as the Ten Cities .
41007032	There some people brought a man to him . The man was deaf and could hardly speak . They begged Jesus to place his hand on him .
41007033	Jesus took the man to one side , away from the crowd . He put his fingers into the man's ears . Then he spit and touched the man's tongue .
41007034	Jesus looked up to heaven . With a deep sigh , he said to the man , " Ephphatha ! " That means " Be opened ! "
41007035	The man's ears were opened . His tongue was freed up , and he began to speak clearly .
41007036	Jesus ordered the people not to tell anyone . But the more he did so , the more they kept talking about it .
41007037	People were really amazed . " He has done everything well , " they said . " He even makes deaf people able to hear . And he makes those who can't speak able to talk . "
41008001	During those days another large crowd gathered . They had nothing to eat . So Jesus called for his disciples to come to him . He said ,
41008002	" I feel deep concern for these people . They have already been with me three days . They don't have anything to eat .
41008003	If I send them away hungry , they will become too weak on their way home . Some of them have come from far away . "
41008004	His disciples answered him . " There is nothing here , " they said . " Where can anyone get enough bread to feed them ? "
41008005	" How many loaves do you have ? " Jesus asked . " Seven , " they replied .
41008006	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground . He took the seven loaves and gave thanks to God . Then he broke them and gave them to his disciples . They set the loaves down in front of the people .
41008007	The disciples also had a few small fish . Jesus gave thanks for them too . He told the disciples to pass them around .
41008008	The people ate and were satisfied . After that , the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces .
41008009	About 4,000 men were there . Jesus sent them away .
41008010	Then he got into a boat with his disciples . He went to the area of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came and began to ask Jesus questions . They wanted to put him to the test . So they asked him for a miraculous sign from heaven .
41008012	He sighed deeply . He said , " Why do you people ask for a sign ? What I'm about to tell you is true . No sign will be given to you . "
41008013	Then he left them . He got back into the boat and crossed to the other side of the lake .
41008014	The disciples had forgotten to bring bread . They had only one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	" Be careful , " Jesus warned them . " Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees . And watch out for the yeast of Herod . "
41008016	They talked about this with each other . They said , " He must be saying this because we don't have any bread . "
41008017	Jesus knew what they were saying . So he asked them , " Why are you talking about having no bread ? Why can't you see or understand ? Are you stubborn ?
41008018	Do you have eyes and still don't see ? Do you have ears and still don't hear ? And don't you remember ?
41008019	Earlier I broke five loaves for the 5,000 . How many baskets of pieces did you pick up ? " " Twelve , " they replied .
41008020	" Later I broke seven loaves for the 4,000 . How many baskets of pieces did you pick up ? " " Seven , " they answered .
41008021	He said to them , " Can't you understand yet ? "
41008022	Jesus and his disciples came to Bethsaida . Some people brought a blind man . They begged Jesus to touch him .
41008023	He took the blind man by the hand . Then he led him outside the village . He spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him . " Do you see anything ? " Jesus asked .
41008024	The man looked up . He said , " I see people . They look like trees walking around . "
41008025	Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes . Then his eyes were opened so that he could see again . He saw everything clearly .
41008026	Jesus sent him home . He told him , " Don't go into the village . "
41008027	Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked them , " Who do people say I am ? "
41008028	They replied , " Some say John the Baptist . Others say Elijah . Still others say one of the prophets . "
41008029	" But what about you ? " he asked . " Who do you say I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
41008030	Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him .
41008031	Jesus then began to teach his disciples . He taught them that the Son of Man must suffer many things . He taught them that the elders would not accept him . The chief priests and the teachers of the law would not accept him either . He must be killed and after three days rise again .
41008032	He spoke clearly about this . Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him .
41008033	Jesus turned and looked at his disciples . He scolded Peter . " Get behind me , Satan ! " he said . " You are not thinking about the things of God . Instead , you are thinking about human things . "
41008034	Jesus called the crowd to him along with his disciples . He said , " If anyone wants to come after me , he must say no to himself . He must pick up his cross and follow me .
41008035	If he wants to save his life , he will lose it . But if he loses his life for me and for the good news , he will save it .
41008036	What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses his soul ?
41008037	Or what can anyone trade for his soul ?
41008038	" Suppose you are ashamed of me and my words among these adulterous and sinful people . Then the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels . "
41009001	Jesus said to them , " What I'm about to tell you is true . Some who are standing here will not die before they see God's kingdom coming with power . "
41009002	After six days Jesus took Peter , James and John with him . He led them up a high mountain . They were all alone . There in front of them his appearance was changed .
41009003	His clothes became so white they shone . They were whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them .
41009004	Elijah and Moses appeared in front of Jesus and his disciples . The two of them were talking with Jesus .
41009005	Peter said to Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three shelters . One will be for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
41009006	Peter didn't really know what to say , because they were so afraid .
41009007	Then a cloud appeared and surrounded them . A voice came from the cloud . It said , " This is my Son , and I love him . Listen to him ! "
41009008	They looked around . Suddenly they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus .
41009009	They came down the mountain . On the way down , Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen . He told them to wait until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41009010	So they kept the matter to themselves . But they asked each other what " rising from the dead " meant .
41009011	Then they asked Jesus , " Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first ? "
41009012	Jesus replied , " That's right . Elijah does come first . He makes all things new again . So why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and not be accepted ?
41009013	I tell you , Elijah has come . They have done to him everything they wanted to do . They did it just as it is written about him . "
41009014	When Jesus and those who were with him came to the other disciples , they saw a large crowd around them . The teachers of the law were arguing with them .
41009015	When all the people saw Jesus , they were filled with wonder . And they ran to greet him .
41009016	" What are you arguing with them about ? " Jesus asked .
41009017	A man in the crowd answered . " Teacher , " he said , " I brought you my son . He is controlled by a spirit . Because of this , my son can't speak anymore .
41009018	When the spirit takes hold of him , it throws him to the ground . He foams at the mouth . He grinds his teeth . And his body becomes stiff . I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit . But they couldn't do it . "
41009019	" You unbelieving people ! " Jesus replied . " How long do I have to stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy to me . "
41009020	So they brought him . As soon as the spirit saw Jesus , it threw the boy into a fit . He fell to the ground . He rolled around and foamed at the mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked the boy's father , " How long has he been like this ? " " Since he was a child , " he answered .
41009022	" The spirit has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him . But if you can do anything , take pity on us . Please help us . "
41009023	" ' If you can ' ? " said Jesus . " Everything is possible for the one who believes . "
41009024	Right away the boy's father cried out , " I do believe ! Help me overcome my unbelief ! "
41009025	Jesus saw that a crowd was running over to see what was happening . Then he ordered the evil spirit to leave the boy . " You spirit that makes him unable to hear and speak ! " he said . " I command you , come out of him . Never enter him again . "
41009026	The spirit screamed . It shook the boy wildly . Then it came out of him . The boy looked so lifeless that many people said , " He's dead . "
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand . He lifted the boy to his feet , and the boy stood up .
41009028	Jesus went indoors . Then his disciples asked him in private , " Why couldn't we drive out the evil spirit ? "
41009029	He replied , " This kind can come out only by prayer . "
41009030	They left that place and passed through Galilee . Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were .
41009031	That was because he was teaching his disciples . He said to them , " The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men . They will kill him . After three days he will rise from the dead . "
41009032	But they didn't understand what he meant . And they were afraid to ask him about it .
41009033	Jesus and his disciples came to a house in Capernaum . There he asked them , " What were you arguing about on the road ? "
41009034	But they kept quiet . On the way , they had argued about which one of them was the most important person .
41009035	Jesus sat down and called for the Twelve to come to him . Then he said , " If you want to be first , you must be the very last . You must be the servant of everyone . "
41009036	Jesus took a little child and had the child stand among them . Then he took the child in his arms . He said to them ,
41009037	" Anyone who welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me . And anyone who welcomes me doesn't welcome only me but also the One who sent me . "
41009038	" Teacher , " said John , " we saw a man driving out demons in your name . We told him to stop , because he was not one of us . "
41009039	" Do not stop him , " Jesus said . " No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me .
41009040	Anyone who is not against us is for us .
41009041	" What I'm about to tell you is true . Suppose someone gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to me . That one will certainly not go without a reward .
41009042	" What if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me to sin ? If he does , it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck .
41009047	" If your eye causes you to sin , poke it out . It would be better for you to enter God's kingdom with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .
41009048	In hell , " ' The worms do not die . The fire is not put out . '
41009049	Everyone will be salted with fire .
41009050	" Salt is good . But suppose it loses its saltiness . How can you make it salty again ? Have salt in yourselves . And be at peace with each other . "
41010001	Jesus left that place and went into the area of Judea and across the Jordan River . Again crowds of people came to him . As usual , he taught them .
41010002	Some Pharisees came to put him to the test . They asked , " Does the Law allow a man to divorce his wife ? "
41010003	" What did Moses command you ? " he replied .
41010004	They said , " Moses allowed a man to write a letter of divorce and send her away . "
41010005	" You were stubborn . That's why Moses wrote you this law , " Jesus replied .
41010006	" But at the beginning of creation , God ' made them male and female . '
41010007	' That's why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .
41010008	The two of them will become one . ' They are no longer two , but one .
41010009	So a man must not separate what God has joined together . "
41010010	When they were in the house again , the disciples asked Jesus about this .
41010011	He answered , " What if a man divorces his wife and gets married to another woman ? He commits adultery against her .
41010012	And what if she divorces her husband and gets married to another man ? She commits adultery . "
41010013	People were bringing little children to Jesus . They wanted him to touch them . But the disciples told the people to stop .
41010014	When Jesus saw this , he was angry . He said to his disciples , " Let the little children come to me . Don't keep them away . God's kingdom belongs to people like them .
41010015	What I'm about to tell you is true . Anyone who will not receive God's kingdom like a little child will never enter it . "
41010016	Then he took the children in his arms . He put his hands on them and blessed them .
41010017	As Jesus started on his way , a man ran up to him . He fell on his knees before Jesus . " Good teacher , " he said , " what must I do to receive eternal life ? "
41010018	" Why do you call me good ? " Jesus answered . " No one is good except God .
41010019	You know what the commandments say . ' Do not commit murder . Do not commit adultery . Do not steal . Do not give false witness . Do not cheat . Honor your father and mother . ' "
41010020	" Teacher , " he said , " I have obeyed all those commandments since I was a boy . "
41010021	Jesus looked at him and loved him . " You are missing one thing , " he said . " Go and sell everything you have . Give the money to those who are poor . You will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . "
41010022	The man's face fell . He went away sad , because he was very rich .
41010023	Jesus looked around . He said to his disciples , " How hard it is for rich people to enter God's kingdom ! "
41010024	The disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus said again , " Children , how hard it is to enter God's kingdom !
41010025	Is it hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle ? It is even harder for the rich to enter God's kingdom ! "
41010026	The disciples were even more amazed . They said to each other , " Then who can be saved ? "
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , " With man , that is impossible . But not with God . All things are possible with God . "
41010028	Peter said to him , " We have left everything to follow you ! "
41010029	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " Jesus replied . " Has anyone left home or family or fields for me and the good news ?
41010030	They will receive 100 times as much in this world . They will have homes and families and fields . But they will also be treated badly by others . In the world to come they will live forever .
41010031	But many who are first will be last . And the last will be first . "
41010032	They were on their way up to Jerusalem . Jesus was leading the way . The disciples were amazed . Those who followed were afraid . Again Jesus took the Twelve to one side . He told them what was going to happen to him .
41010033	" We are going up to Jerusalem , " he said . " The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law . They will sentence him to death . Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews .
41010034	The people will make fun of him and spit on him . They will whip him and kill him . Three days later he will rise from the dead ! "
41010035	James and John came to Jesus . They were the sons of Zebedee . " Teacher , " they said , " we would like to ask a favor of you . "
41010036	" What do you want me to do for you ? " he asked .
41010037	They replied , " Let one of us sit at your right hand in your glorious kingdom . Let the other one sit at your left hand . "
41010038	" You don't know what you're asking for , " Jesus said . " Can you drink the cup of suffering I drink ? Or can you go through the baptism of suffering I must go through ? "
41010039	" We can , " they answered . Jesus said to them , " You will drink the cup I drink . And you will go through the baptism I go through .
41010040	But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or left hand . These places belong to those they are prepared for . "
41010041	The other ten disciples heard about it . They became angry at James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them together . He said , " You know about those who are rulers of the nations . They hold power over their people . Their high officials order them around .
41010043	Don't be like that . Instead , anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant .
41010044	And anyone who wants to be first must be the slave of everyone .
41010045	Even the Son of Man did not come to be served . Instead , he came to serve others . He came to give his life as the price for setting many people free . "
41010046	Jesus and his disciples came to Jericho . They were leaving the city . A large crowd was with them . A blind man was sitting by the side of the road begging . His name was Bartimaeus . Bartimaeus means Son of Timaeus .
41010047	He heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by . So he began to shout , " Jesus ! Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! "
41010048	Many people commanded him to stop . They told him to be quiet . But he shouted even louder , " Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! "
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , " Call for him . " So they called out to the blind man , " Cheer up ! Get up on your feet ! Jesus is calling for you . "
41010050	He threw his coat to one side . Then he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus .
41010051	" What do you want me to do for you ? " Jesus asked him . The blind man said , " Rabbi , I want to be able to see . "
41010052	" Go , " said Jesus . " Your faith has healed you . " Right away he could see . And he followed Jesus along the road .
41011001	As they all approached Jerusalem , they came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives . Jesus sent out two of his disciples .
41011002	He said to them , " Go to the village ahead of you . Just as you enter it , you will find a donkey's colt tied there . No one has ever ridden it . Untie it and bring it here .
41011003	Someone may ask you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' If so , say , ' The Lord needs it . But he will send it back here soon . ' "
41011004	So they left . They found a colt out in the street . It was tied at a doorway . They untied it .
41011005	Some people standing there asked , " What are you doing ? Why are you untying that colt ? "
41011006	They answered as Jesus had told them to . So the people let them go .
41011007	They brought the colt to Jesus . They threw their coats over it . Then he sat on it .
41011008	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others spread branches they had cut in the fields .
41011009	Those in front and those in back shouted , " Hosanna ! " " Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! "
41011010	" Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ! " " Hosanna in the highest heaven ! "
41011011	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple . He looked around at everything . But it was already late . So he went out to Bethany with the Twelve .
41011012	The next day as Jesus and his disciples were leaving Bethany , they were hungry .
41011013	Not too far away , he saw a fig tree . It was covered with leaves . He went to find out if it had any fruit . When he reached it , he found nothing but leaves . It was not the season for figs .
41011014	Then Jesus said to the tree , " May no one ever eat fruit from you again ! " And his disciples heard him say it .
41011015	When Jesus reached Jerusalem , he entered the temple area . He began chasing out those who were buying and selling there . He turned over the tables of the people who were exchanging money . He also turned over the benches of those who were selling doves .
41011016	He would not allow anyone to carry items for sale through the temple courtyards .
41011017	Then he taught them . He told them , " It is written that the Lord said , " ' My house will be called a house where people from all nations can pray . ' But you have made it a ' den for robbers . ' "
41011018	The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard about this . They began looking for a way to kill Jesus . They were afraid of him , because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching .
41011019	When evening came , Jesus and his disciples left the city .
41011020	In the morning as Jesus and his disciples walked along , they saw the fig tree . It was dried up all the way down to the roots .
41011021	Peter remembered . He said to Jesus , " Rabbi , look ! The fig tree you put a curse on has dried up ! "
41011022	" Have faith in God , " Jesus said .
41011023	" What I'm about to tell you is true . Suppose one of you says to this mountain , ' Go and throw yourself into the sea . ' You must not doubt in your heart . You must believe that what you say will happen . Then it will be done for you .
41011024	" So I tell you , when you pray for something , believe that you have already received it . Then it will be yours .
41011027	Jesus and his disciples arrived again in Jerusalem . He was walking in the temple courtyards . Then the chief priests came to him . The teachers of the law and the elders came too .
41011028	" By what authority are you doing these things ? " they asked . " Who gave you authority to do this ? "
41011029	Jesus replied , " I will ask you one question . Answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
41011030	Was John's baptism from heaven ? Or did it come from men ? Tell me ! "
41011031	They talked to each other about it . They said , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask , ' Then why didn't you believe him ? '
41011032	But what if we say , ' From men ' ? " They were afraid of the people . Everyone believed that John really was a prophet .
41011033	So they answered Jesus , " We don't know . " Jesus said , " Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things either . "
41012001	Jesus began to speak to the people by using stories . He said , " A man planted a vineyard . He put a wall around it . He dug a pit for a winepress . He also built a lookout tower . He rented the vineyard out to some farmers . Then he went away on a journey .
41012002	" At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters . He told the servant to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
41012003	But they grabbed the servant and beat him up . Then they sent him away with nothing .
41012004	So the man sent another servant to the renters . They hit this one on the head and treated him badly .
41012005	The man sent still another servant . The renters killed him . The man sent many others . The renters beat up some of them . They killed the others .
41012006	" The man had one person left to send . It was his son , and he loved him . He sent him last of all . He said , ' They will respect my son . '
41012007	" But the renters said to each other , ' This is the one who will receive all the owner's property someday . Come , let's kill him . Then everything will be ours . '
41012008	So they took him and killed him . They threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	" What will the owner of the vineyard do then ? He will come and kill those renters . He will give the vineyard to others .
41012010	" Haven't you read what Scripture says , " ' The stone the builders didn't accept has become the most important stone of all .
41012011	The Lord has done it . It is wonderful in our eyes' ? "
41012012	Then the religious leaders looked for a way to arrest Jesus . They knew he had told the story against them . But they were afraid of the crowd . So they left him and went away .
41012013	Later the religious leaders sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus . They wanted to trap him with his own words .
41012014	They came to him and said , " Teacher , we know you are a man of honor . You don't let others tell you what to do or say . You don't care how important they are . But you teach the way of God truthfully . Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ?
41012015	Should we pay or shouldn't we ? " But Jesus knew what they were trying to do . So he asked , " Why are you trying to trap me ? Bring me a silver coin . Let me look at it . "
41012016	They brought the coin . He asked them , " Whose picture is this ? And whose words ? " " Caesar's , " they replied .
41012017	Then Jesus said to them , " Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar . And give to God what belongs to God . " They were amazed at him .
41012018	The Sadducees came to Jesus with a question . They do not believe that people rise from the dead .
41012019	" Teacher , " they said , " Moses wrote for us about a man who died and didn't have any children . But he did leave a wife behind . That man's brother must get married to the widow . He must have children to carry on his dead brother's name .
41012020	" There were seven brothers . The first one got married . He died without leaving any children .
41012021	The second one got married to the widow . He also died and left no child . It was the same with the third one .
41012022	In fact , none of the seven left any children . Last of all , the woman died too .
41012023	When the dead rise , whose wife will she be ? All seven of them were married to her . "
41012024	Jesus replied , " You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures . And you do not know the power of God .
41012025	When the dead rise , they won't get married . And their parents won't give them to be married . They will be like the angels in heaven .
41012026	" What about the dead rising ? Haven't you read in the scroll of Moses the story of the bush ? God said to Moses , ' I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob . '
41012027	He is not the God of the dead . He is the God of the living . You have made a big mistake ! "
41012028	One of the teachers of the law came and heard the Sadducees arguing . He noticed that Jesus had given the Sadducees a good answer . So he asked him , " Which is the most important of all the commandments ? "
41012029	Jesus answered , " Here is the most important one . Moses said , ' Israel , listen to me . The Lord is our God . The Lord is one .
41012030	Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Love him with all your mind and with all your strength . '
41012031	And here is the second one . ' Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ' There is no commandment more important than these . "
41012032	" You have spoken well , teacher , " the man replied . " You are right in saying that God is one . There is no other God but him .
41012033	To love God with all your heart and mind and strength is very important . So is loving your neighbor as you love yourself . These things are more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
41012034	Jesus saw that the man had answered wisely . He said to him , " You are not far from God's kingdom . " From then on , no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions .
41012035	Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard . He asked , " Why do the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David ?
41012036	The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself . David said , " ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control . " '
41012037	David himself calls him ' Lord . ' So how can he be David's son ? " The large crowd listened to Jesus with delight .
41012038	As he taught , he said , " Watch out for the teachers of the law . They like to walk around in long robes . They like to be greeted in the market places .
41012039	They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues . They also love to have the places of honor at dinners .
41012040	They take over the houses of widows . They say long prayers to show off . God will punish those men very much . "
41012041	Jesus sat down across from the place where people put their temple offerings . He watched the crowd putting their money into the offering boxes . Many rich people threw large amounts into them .
41012042	But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins . They were worth much less than a penny .
41012043	Jesus asked his disciples to come to him . He said , " What I'm about to tell you is true . That poor widow has put more into the offering box than all the others .
41012044	They all gave a lot because they are rich . But she gave even though she is poor . She put in everything she had . She gave all she had to live on . "
41013001	Jesus was leaving the temple . One of his disciples said to him , " Look , Teacher ! What huge stones ! What wonderful buildings ! "
41013002	" Do you see these huge buildings ? " Jesus asked . " Not one stone here will be left on top of another . Every stone will be thrown down . "
41013003	Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , across from the temple . Peter , James , John and Andrew asked him a question in private .
41013004	" Tell us , " they said . " When will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are all about to come true ? "
41013005	Jesus said to them , " Keep watch ! Be careful that no one fools you .
41013006	Many will come in my name . They will claim , ' I am he . ' They will fool many people .
41013007	" You will hear about wars . You will also hear people talking about future wars . Don't be alarmed . Those things must happen . But the end still isn't here .
41013008	Nation will fight against nation . Kingdom will fight against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in many places . People will go hungry . All of those things are the beginning of birth pains .
41013009	" Watch out ! You will be handed over to the local courts . You will be whipped in the synagogues . You will stand in front of governors and kings because of me . In that way you will be witnesses to them .
41013010	The good news has to be preached to all nations before the end comes .
41013011	You will be arrested and brought to trial . But don't worry ahead of time about what you will say . Just say what God brings to your mind at the time . It is not you speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	" Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed . Fathers will hand over their children . Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death .
41013013	Everyone will hate you because of me . But the one who stands firm to the end will be saved .
41013014	" You will see ' the hated thing that destroys . ' It will stand where it does not belong . The reader should understand this . Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains .
41013015	No one on the roof should go down into his house to take anything out .
41013016	No one in the field should go back to get his coat .
41013017	How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women ! How awful for nursing mothers !
41013018	Pray that this will not happen in winter .
41013019	" Those days will be worse than any others from the time God created the world until now . And there will never be any like them again .
41013020	If the Lord had not cut the time short , no one would live . But because of God's chosen people , he has shortened it .
41013021	" At that time someone may say to you , ' Look ! Here is the Christ ! ' Or , ' Look ! There he is ! ' Do not believe it .
41013022	False Christs and false prophets will appear . They will do signs and miracles . They will try to fool God's chosen people if possible .
41013023	Keep watch ! I have told you everything ahead of time .
41013024	" So in those days there will be terrible suffering . After that , Scripture says , " ' The sun will be darkened . The moon will not shine .
41013025	The stars will fall from the sky . The heavenly bodies will be shaken . '
41013026	" At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds . He will come with great power and glory .
41013027	He will send his angels . He will gather his chosen people from all four directions . He will bring them from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens .
41013028	" Learn a lesson from the fig tree . As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out , you know that summer is near .
41013029	In the same way , when you see those things happening , you know that the end is near . It is right at the door .
41013030	What I'm about to tell you is true . The people living at that time will certainly not pass away until all those things have happened .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away . But my words will never pass away .
41013032	" No one knows about that day or hour . Not even the angels in heaven know . The Son does not know . Only the Father knows .
41013033	" Keep watch ! Stay awake ! You do not know when that time will come .
41013034	It's like a man going away . He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge . Each one is given a task to do . He tells the one at the door to keep watch .
41013035	" So keep watch ! You do not know when the owner of the house will come back . It may be in the evening or at midnight . It may be when the rooster crows or at dawn .
41013036	He may come suddenly . So do not let him find you sleeping .
41013037	" What I say to you , I say to everyone . ' Watch ! ' "
41014001	The Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away . The chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for a clever way to arrest Jesus . They wanted to kill him .
41014002	" But not during the Feast , " they said . " The people may stir up trouble . "
41014003	Jesus was in Bethany . He was at the table in the home of a man named Simon , who had a skin disease . A woman came with a special sealed jar of very expensive perfume . It was made out of pure nard . She broke the jar open and poured the perfume on Jesus' head .
41014004	Some of the people there became angry . They said to one another , " Why waste this perfume ?
41014005	It could have been sold for more than a year's pay . The money could have been given to poor people . " So they found fault with the woman .
41014006	" Leave her alone , " Jesus said . " Why are you bothering her ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
41014007	You will always have poor people with you . You can help them any time you want to . But you will not always have me .
41014008	She did what she could . She poured perfume on my body to prepare me to be buried .
41014009	What I'm about to tell you is true . What she has done will be told anywhere the good news is preached all over the world . It will be told in memory of her . "
41014010	Judas Iscariot was one of the Twelve . He went to the chief priests to hand Jesus over to them .
41014011	They were delighted to hear that he would do this . They promised to give Judas money . So he watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them .
41014012	It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread . That was the time to sacrifice the Passover lamb . Jesus' disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal ? "
41014013	So he sent out two of his disciples . He told them , " Go into the city . A man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him .
41014014	He will enter a house . Say to its owner , ' The Teacher asks , " Where is my guest room ? Where can I eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? " '
41014015	He will show you a large upstairs room . It will have furniture and will be ready . Prepare for us to eat there . "
41014016	The disciples left and went into the city . They found things just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover meal .
41014017	When evening came , Jesus arrived with the Twelve .
41014018	While they were at the table eating , Jesus said , " What I'm about to tell you is true . One of you who is eating with me will hand me over to my enemies . "
41014019	The disciples became sad . One by one they said to him , " It's not I , is it ? "
41014020	" It is one of the Twelve , " Jesus replied . " It is the one who dips bread into the bowl with me .
41014021	The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him . But how terrible it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born . "
41014022	While they were eating , Jesus took bread . He gave thanks and broke it . He handed it to his disciples and said , " Take it . This is my body . "
41014023	Then he took the cup . He gave thanks and handed it to them . All of them drank from it .
41014024	" This is my blood of the new covenant , " he said to them . " It is poured out for many .
41014025	What I'm about to tell you is true . I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it in God's kingdom . "
41014026	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	" You will all turn away , " Jesus told the disciples . " It is written , " ' I will strike the shepherd down . Then the sheep will be scattered . '
41014028	But after I rise from the dead , I will go ahead of you into Galilee . "
41014029	Peter said , " All the others may turn away . But I will not . "
41014030	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " Jesus answered . " It will happen today , this very night . Before the rooster crows twice , you yourself will say three times that you don't know me . "
41014031	But Peter would not give in . He said , " I may have to die with you . But I will never say I don't know you . " And all the others said the same thing .
41014032	Jesus and his disciples went to a place called Gethsemane . Jesus said to them , " Sit here while I pray . "
41014033	He took Peter , James and John along with him . He began to be very upset and troubled .
41014034	" My soul is very sad . I feel close to death , " he said to them . " Stay here . Keep watch . "
41014035	He went a little farther . Then he fell to the ground . He prayed that , if possible , the hour might pass by him .
41014036	[ " Abba ] , " he said , " everything is possible for you . Take this cup of suffering away from me . But let what you want be done , not what I want . " Abba means Father .
41014037	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . " Simon , " he said to Peter , " are you asleep ? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour ?
41014038	Watch and pray . Then you won't fall into sin when you are tempted . The spirit is willing . But the body is weak . "
41014039	Once more Jesus went away and prayed the same thing .
41014040	Then he came back . Again he found them sleeping . They couldn't keep their eyes open . They did not know what to say to him .
41014041	Jesus returned the third time . He said to them , " Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough ! The hour has come . Look ! The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners .
41014042	Get up ! Let us go ! Here comes the one who is handing me over to them ! "
41014043	Just as Jesus was speaking , Judas appeared . He was one of the Twelve . A crowd was with him . They were carrying swords and clubs . The chief priests , the teachers of the law , and the elders had sent them .
41014044	Judas , who was going to hand Jesus over , had arranged a signal with them . " The one I kiss is the man , " he said . " Arrest him and have the guards lead him away . "
41014045	So Judas went to Jesus at once . He said , " Rabbi ! " And he kissed him .
41014046	The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
41014047	Then one of those standing nearby pulled his sword out . He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
41014048	" Am I leading a band of armed men against you ? " asked Jesus . " Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to capture me ?
41014049	Every day I was with you . I taught in the temple courtyard , and you didn't arrest me . But the Scriptures must come true . "
41014050	Then everyone left him and ran away .
41014051	A young man was following Jesus . The man was wearing nothing but a piece of linen cloth . When the crowd grabbed him ,
41014052	he ran away naked . He left his clothing behind .
41014053	The crowd took Jesus to the high priest . All of the chief priests , the elders , and the teachers of the law came together .
41014054	Not too far away , Peter followed Jesus . He went right into the courtyard of the high priest . There he sat with the guards . He warmed himself at the fire .
41014055	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for something to use against Jesus . They wanted to put him to death . But they did not find any proof .
41014056	Many witnesses lied about him . But their stories did not agree .
41014057	Then some stood up . They gave false witness about him .
41014058	" We heard him say , ' I will destroy this temple made by human hands . In three days I will build another temple , not made by human hands . ' "
41014059	But what they said did not agree .
41014060	Then the high priest stood up in front of them . He asked Jesus , " Aren't you going to answer ? What are these charges these men are bringing against you ? "
41014061	But Jesus remained silent . He gave no answer . Again the high priest asked him , " Are you the Christ ? Are you the Son of the Blessed One ? "
41014062	" I am , " said Jesus . " And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One . You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven . "
41014063	The high priest tore his clothes . " Why do we need any more witnesses ? " he asked .
41014064	" You have heard him say a very evil thing against God . What do you think ? " They all found him guilty and said he must die .
41014065	Then some began to spit at him . They blindfolded him . They hit him with their fists . They said , " Prophesy ! " And the guards took him and beat him .
41014066	Peter was below in the courtyard . One of the high priest's female servants came by .
41014067	When she saw Peter warming himself , she looked closely at him . " You also were with Jesus , that Nazarene , " she said .
41014068	But Peter said he had not been with him . " I don't know or understand what you're talking about , " he said . He went out to the entrance to the courtyard .
41014069	The servant saw him there . She said again to those standing around , " This fellow is one of them . "
41014070	Again he said he was not . After a little while , those standing nearby said to Peter , " You must be one of them . You are from Galilee . "
41014071	He began to call down curses on himself . He took an oath and said to them , " I don't know this man you're talking about ! "
41014072	Right away the rooster crowed the second time . Then Peter remembered what Jesus had spoken to him . " The rooster will crow twice , " he had said . " Before it does , you will say three times that you don't know me . " Peter broke down and sobbed .
41015001	It was very early in the morning . The chief priests , with the elders , the teachers of the law , and the whole Sanhedrin , made a decision . They tied Jesus up and led him away . Then they handed him over to Pilate .
41015002	" Are you the king of the Jews ? " asked Pilate . " Yes . It is just as you say , " Jesus replied .
41015003	The chief priests brought many charges against him .
41015004	So Pilate asked him again , " Aren't you going to answer ? See how many things they charge you with . "
41015005	But Jesus still did not reply . Pilate was amazed .
41015006	It was the usual practice at the Passover Feast to let one prisoner go free . The people could choose the one they wanted .
41015007	A man named Barabbas was in prison . He was there with some other people who had fought against the country's rulers . They had committed murder while they were fighting against the rulers .
41015008	The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did .
41015009	" Do you want me to let the king of the Jews go free ? " asked Pilate .
41015010	He knew that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him because they were jealous .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd . So the crowd asked Pilate to let Barabbas go free instead .
41015012	" Then what should I do with the one you call the king of the Jews ? " Pilate asked them .
41015013	" Crucify him ! " the crowd shouted .
41015014	" Why ? What wrong has he done ? " asked Pilate . But they shouted even louder , " Crucify him ! "
41015015	Pilate wanted to satisfy the crowd . So he let Barabbas go free . He ordered that Jesus be whipped . Then he handed him over to be nailed to a cross .
41015016	The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace . It was called the Praetorium . They called together the whole company of soldiers .
41015017	The soldiers put a purple robe on Jesus . Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown . They placed it on his head .
41015018	They began to call out to him , " We honor you , king of the Jews ! "
41015019	Again and again they hit him on the head with a stick . They spit on him . They fell on their knees and pretended to honor him .
41015020	After they had made fun of him , they took off the purple robe . They put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him out to nail him to a cross .
41015021	A man named Simon from Cyrene was passing by . He was the father of Alexander and Rufus . Simon was on his way in from the country . The soldiers forced him to carry the cross .
41015022	They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha . The word Golgotha means The Place of the Skull .
41015023	Then they gave him wine mixed with spices . But he did not take it .
41015024	They nailed him to the cross . Then they divided up his clothes . They cast lots to see what each of them would get .
41015025	It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him .
41015026	They wrote out the charge against him . It read , the king of the jews .
41015029	Those who passed by shouted at Jesus and made fun of him . They shook their heads and said , " So you are going to destroy the temple and build it again in three days ?
41015030	Then come down from the cross ! Save yourself ! "
41015031	In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law made fun of him among themselves . " He saved others , " they said . " But he can't save himself !
41015032	Let this Christ , this King of Israel , come down now from the cross ! When we see that , we will believe . " Those who were being crucified with Jesus also made fun of him .
41015033	At noon , darkness covered the whole land . It lasted three hours .
41015034	At three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " This means " My God , my God , why have you deserted me ? "
41015035	Some of those standing nearby heard Jesus cry out . They said , " Listen ! He's calling for Elijah . "
41015036	One of them ran and filled a sponge with wine vinegar . He put it on a stick . He offered it to Jesus to drink . " Leave him alone , " he said . " Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down . "
41015037	With a loud cry , Jesus took his last breath .
41015038	The temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	A Roman commander was standing there in front of Jesus . He heard his cry and saw how Jesus died . Then he said , " This man was surely the Son of God ! "
41015040	Not very far away , some women were watching . Mary Magdalene was among them . Mary , the mother of the younger James and of Joses , was also there . So was Salome .
41015041	In Galilee those women had followed Jesus . They had taken care of his needs . Many other women were also there . They had come up with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	It was the day before the Sabbath . That day was called Preparation Day . As evening approached ,
41015043	Joseph went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body . Joseph was from the town of Arimathea . He was a leading member of the Jewish Council . He was waiting for God's kingdom .
41015044	Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead . So he called for the Roman commander . He asked him if Jesus had already died .
41015045	The commander said it was true . So Pilate gave the body to Joseph .
41015046	Then Joseph bought some linen cloth . He took the body down and wrapped it in the linen . He put it in a tomb cut out of rock . Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where Jesus' body had been placed .
41016001	The Sabbath day ended . Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought spices . They were going to apply them to Jesus' body .
41016002	Very early on the first day of the week , they were on their way to the tomb . It was just after sunrise .
41016003	They asked each other , " Who will roll the stone away from the entrance to the tomb ? "
41016004	Then they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away . The stone was very large .
41016005	They entered the tomb . As they did , they saw a young man dressed in a white robe . He was sitting on the right side . They were alarmed .
41016006	" Don't be alarmed , " he said . " You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene , who was crucified . But he has risen ! He is not here ! See the place where they had put him .
41016007	Go ! Tell his disciples and Peter , ' He is going ahead of you into Galilee . There you will see him . It will be just as he told you . ' "
41016008	The women were shaking and confused . They went out and ran away from the tomb . They said nothing to anyone , because they were afraid .
41016009	Jesus rose from the dead early on the first day of the week . He appeared first to Mary Magdalene . He had driven seven demons out of her .
41016010	She went and told those who had been with him . She found them crying . They were very sad .
41016011	They heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him . But they did not believe it .
41016012	After that , Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them . This happened while they were walking out in the country .
41016013	The two returned and told the others about it . But the others did not believe them either .
41016014	Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating . He spoke firmly to them because they had no faith . They would not believe those who had seen him after he rose from the dead .
41016015	He said to them , " Go into all the world . Preach the good news to everyone .
41016016	Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved . But anyone who does not believe will be punished .
41016017	Here are the miraculous signs that those who believe will do . In my name they will drive out demons . They will speak in languages they had not known before .
41016018	They will pick up snakes with their hands . And when they drink deadly poison , it will not hurt them at all . They will place their hands on sick people . And the people will get well . "
41016019	When the Lord Jesus finished speaking to them , he was taken up into heaven . He sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere . The Lord worked with them . And he backed up his word by the signs that went with it .
42001001	Many people have attempted to write about the things that have taken place among us .
42001002	Reports of these things were handed down to us . There were people who saw these things for themselves from the beginning and then passed the word on .
42001003	I myself have carefully looked into everything from the beginning . So it seemed good also to me to write down an orderly report of exactly what happened . I am doing this for you , most excellent Theophilus .
42001004	I want you to know that the things you have been taught are true .
42001005	Herod was king of Judea . During the time he was ruling , there was a priest named Zechariah . He belonged to a group of priests named after Abijah . His wife Elizabeth also came from the family line of Aaron .
42001006	Both of them did what was right in God's eyes . They obeyed all the Lord's commandments and rules faithfully .
42001007	But they had no children , because Elizabeth was not able to have any . And they were both very old .
42001008	One day Zechariah's group was on duty . He was serving as a priest in God's temple .
42001009	He happened to be chosen , in the usual way , to go into the temple of the Lord . There he was supposed to burn incense .
42001010	The time came for this to be done . All who had gathered to worship were praying outside .
42001011	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah . The angel was standing at the right side of the incense altar .
42001012	When Zechariah saw him , he was amazed and terrified .
42001013	But the angel said to him , " Do not be afraid , Zechariah . Your prayer has been heard . Your wife Elizabeth will have a child . It will be a boy , and you must name him John .
42001014	He will be a joy and delight to you . His birth will make many people very glad .
42001015	He will be important in the Lord's eyes . " He must never use wine or other such drinks . He will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the time he is born .
42001016	He will bring many of Israel's people back to the Lord their God .
42001017	And he will prepare the way for the Lord . He will have the same spirit and power that Elijah had . He will teach parents how to love their children . He will also teach people who don't obey to be wise and do what is right . In this way , he will prepare a people who are ready for the Lord . "
42001018	Zechariah asked the angel , " How can I be sure of this ? I am an old man , and my wife is old too . "
42001019	The angel answered , " I am Gabriel . I serve God . I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news .
42001020	And now you will have to be silent . You will not be able to speak until after John is born . That's because you did not believe my words . They will come true when the time is right . "
42001021	During that time , the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out . They wondered why he stayed in the temple so long .
42001022	When he came out , he could not speak to them . They realized he had seen a vision in the temple . They knew this because he kept motioning to them . He still could not speak .
42001023	When his time of service was over , he returned home .
42001024	After that , his wife Elizabeth became pregnant . She stayed at home for five months .
42001025	" The Lord has done this for me , " she said . " In these days , he has been kind to me . He has taken away my shame among the people . "
42001026	In the sixth month after Elizabeth had become pregnant , God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth , a town in Galilee .
42001027	He was sent to a virgin . The girl was engaged to a man named Joseph . He came from the family line of David . The virgin's name was Mary .
42001028	The angel greeted her and said , " The Lord has given you special favor . He is with you . "
42001029	Mary was very upset because of his words . She wondered what kind of greeting this could be .
42001030	But the angel said to her , " Do not be afraid , Mary . God is very pleased with you .
42001031	You will become pregnant and give birth to a son . You must name him Jesus .
42001032	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High God . The Lord God will make him a king like his father David of long ago .
42001033	He will rule forever over his people , who came from Jacob's family . His kingdom will never end . "
42001034	" How can this happen ? " Mary asked the angel . " I am a virgin . "
42001035	The angel answered , " The Holy Spirit will come to you . The power of the Most High God will cover you . So the holy one that is born will be called the Son of God .
42001036	Your relative Elizabeth is old . And even she is going to have a child . People thought she could not have children . But she has been pregnant for six months now .
42001037	Nothing is impossible with God . "
42001038	" I serve the Lord , " Mary answered . " May it happen to me just as you said it would . " Then the angel left her .
42001039	At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in Judea's hill country .
42001040	There she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting , the baby inside her jumped . And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	In a loud voice she called out , " God has blessed you more than other women . And blessed is the child you will have !
42001043	But why is God so kind to me ? Why has the mother of my Lord come to me ?
42001044	As soon as I heard the sound of your voice , the baby inside me jumped for joy .
42001045	You are a woman God has blessed . You have believed that what the Lord has said to you will be done ! "
42001046	Mary said , " My soul gives glory to the Lord .
42001047	My spirit delights in God my Savior .
42001048	He has taken note of me even though I am not important . From now on all people will call me blessed .
42001049	The Mighty One has done great things for me . His name is holy .
42001050	He shows his mercy to those who have respect for him , from parent to child down through the years .
42001051	He has done mighty things with his arm . He has scattered those who are proud in their deepest thoughts .
42001052	He has brought down rulers from their thrones . But he has lifted up people who are not important .
42001053	He has filled those who are hungry with good things . But he has sent those who are rich away empty .
42001054	He has helped the people of Israel , who serve him . He has always remembered to be kind
42001055	to Abraham and his children down through the years . He has done it just as he said to our people of long ago . "
42001056	Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months . Then she returned home .
42001057	The time came for Elizabeth to have her baby . She gave birth to a son .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very kind to her . They shared her joy .
42001059	On the eighth day , they came to have the child circumcised . They were going to name him Zechariah , like his father .
42001060	But his mother spoke up . " No ! " she said . " He must be called John . "
42001061	They said to her , " No one among your relatives has that name . "
42001062	Then they motioned to his father . They wanted to find out what he would like to name the child .
42001063	He asked for something to write on . Then he wrote , " His name is John . " Everyone was amazed .
42001064	Right away Zechariah could speak again . His first words gave praise to God .
42001065	The neighbors were all filled with fear and wonder . All through Judea's hill country , people were talking about all these things .
42001066	Everyone who heard this wondered about it . And because the Lord was with John , they asked , " What is this child going to be ? "
42001067	His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit . He prophesied ,
42001068	" Give praise to the Lord , the God of Israel ! He has come and set his people free .
42001069	He has acted with great power and has saved us . He did it for those who are from the family line of his servant David .
42001070	Long ago holy prophets said he would do it .
42001071	He has saved us from our enemies . We are rescued from all who hate us .
42001072	He has been kind to our people . He has remembered his holy covenant .
42001073	He made an oath to our father Abraham .
42001074	He promised to save us from our enemies , so that we could serve him without fear .
42001075	He wants us to be holy and godly as long as we live .
42001076	" And you , my child , will be called a prophet of the Most High God . You will go ahead of the Lord to prepare the way for him .
42001077	You will tell his people how they can be saved . You will tell them that their sins can be forgiven .
42001078	All of that will happen because our God is tender and caring . His kindness will bring the rising sun to us from heaven .
42001079	It will shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death . It will guide our feet on the path of peace . "
42001080	The child grew up , and his spirit became strong . He lived in the desert until he appeared openly to Israel .
42002001	In those days , Caesar Augustus made a law . It required that a list be made of everyone in the whole Roman world .
42002002	It was the first time a list was made of the people while Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	All went to their own towns to be listed .
42002004	So Joseph went also . He went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea . That is where Bethlehem , the town of David , was . Joseph went there because he belonged to the family line of David .
42002005	He went there with Mary to be listed . Mary was engaged to him . She was expecting a baby .
42002006	While Joseph and Mary were there , the time came for the child to be born .
42002007	She gave birth to her first baby . It was a boy . She wrapped him in large strips of cloth . Then she placed him in a manger . There was no room for them in the inn .
42002008	There were shepherds living out in the fields nearby . It was night , and they were looking after their sheep .
42002009	An angel of the Lord appeared to them . And the glory of the Lord shone around them . They were terrified .
42002010	But the angel said to them , " Do not be afraid . I bring you good news of great joy . It is for all the people .
42002011	Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you . He is Christ the Lord .
42002012	Here is how you will know I am telling you the truth . You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger . "
42002013	Suddenly a large group of angels from heaven also appeared . They were praising God . They said ,
42002014	" May glory be given to God in the highest heaven ! And may peace be given to those he is pleased with on earth ! "
42002015	The angels left and went into heaven . Then the shepherds said to one another , " Let's go to Bethlehem . Let's see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has told us about . "
42002016	So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby . The baby was lying in the manger .
42002017	After the shepherds had seen him , they told everyone . They reported what the angel had said about this child .
42002018	All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them .
42002019	But Mary kept all these things like a secret treasure in her heart . She thought about them over and over .
42002020	The shepherds returned . They gave glory and praise to God . Everything they had seen and heard was just as they had been told .
42002021	When the child was eight days old , he was circumcised . At the same time he was named Jesus . This was the name the angel had given him before his mother became pregnant .
42002022	The time for making them pure came as it is written in the Law of Moses . So Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem . There they presented him to the Lord .
42002023	In the Law of the Lord it says , " The first boy born in every family must be set apart for the Lord . "
42002024	They also offered a sacrifice . They did it in keeping with the Law , which says , " a pair of doves or two young pigeons . "
42002025	In Jerusalem there was a man named Simeon . He was a good and godly man . He was waiting for God's promise to Israel to happen . The Holy Spirit was with him .
42002026	The Spirit had told Simeon that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ .
42002027	The Spirit led him into the temple courtyard . Then Jesus' parents brought the child in . They came to do for him what the Law required .
42002028	Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God . He said ,
42002029	" Lord , you are the King over all . Now let me , your servant , go in peace . That is what you promised .
42002030	My eyes have seen your salvation .
42002031	You have prepared it in the sight of all people .
42002032	It is a light to be given to those who aren't Jews . It will bring glory to your people Israel . "
42002033	The child's father and mother were amazed at what was said about him .
42002034	Then Simeon blessed them . He said to Mary , Jesus' mother , " This child is going to cause many people in Israel to fall and to rise . God has sent him . But many will speak against him .
42002035	The thoughts of many hearts will be known . A sword will wound your own soul too . "
42002036	There was also a prophet named Anna . She was the daughter of Penuel from the tribe of Asher . Anna was very old . After getting married , she lived with her husband seven years .
42002037	Then she was a widow until she was 84 . She never left the temple . She worshiped night and day , praying and going without eating .
42002038	Anna came up to Jesus' family at that very moment . She gave thanks to God . And she spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the time when Jerusalem would be set free .
42002039	Joseph and Mary did everything the Law of the Lord required . Then they returned to Galilee . They went to their own town of Nazareth .
42002040	And the child grew and became strong . He was very wise . He was blessed by God's grace .
42002041	Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast .
42002042	When he was 12 years old , they went up to the Feast as usual .
42002043	After the Feast was over , his parents left to go back home . The boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . But they were not aware of it .
42002044	They thought he was somewhere in their group . So they traveled on for a day . Then they began to look for him among their relatives and friends .
42002045	They did not find him . So they went back to Jerusalem to look for him .
42002046	After three days they found him in the temple courtyard . He was sitting with the teachers . He was listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	Everyone who heard him was amazed at how much he understood . They also were amazed at his answers .
42002048	When his parents saw him , they were amazed . His mother said to him , " Son , why have you treated us like this ? Your father and I have been worried about you . We have been looking for you everywhere . "
42002049	" Why were you looking for me ? " he asked . " Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house ? "
42002050	But they did not understand what he meant by that .
42002051	Then he went back to Nazareth with them , and he obeyed them . But his mother kept all these things like a secret treasure in her heart .
42002052	Jesus became wiser and stronger . He also became more and more pleasing to God and to people .
42003001	Tiberius Caesar had been ruling for 15 years . Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea . Herod was the ruler of Galilee . His brother Philip was the ruler of Iturea and Traconitis . Lysanias was ruler of Abilene .
42003002	Annas and Caiaphas were high priests . At that time God's word came to John , son of Zechariah , in the desert .
42003003	He went into all the countryside around the Jordan River . There he preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins . Then God would forgive them .
42003004	Here is what is written in the scroll of the prophet Isaiah . It says , " A messenger is calling out in the desert , ' Prepare the way for the Lord . Make straight paths for him .
42003005	Every valley will be filled in . Every mountain and hill will be made level . The crooked roads will become straight . The rough ways will become smooth .
42003006	And everyone will see God's salvation . ' "
42003007	John spoke to the crowds coming to be baptized by him . He said , " You are like a nest of poisonous snakes ! Who warned you to escape the coming of God's anger ?
42003008	Produce fruit that shows you have turned away from your sins . And don't start saying to yourselves , ' Abraham is our father . ' I tell you , God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones .
42003009	The ax is already lying at the roots of the trees . All the trees that don't produce good fruit will be cut down . They will be thrown into the fire . "
42003010	" Then what should we do ? " the crowd asked .
42003011	John answered , " If you have extra clothes , you should share with those who have none . And if you have extra food , you should do the same . "
42003012	Tax collectors also came to be baptized . " Teacher , " they asked , " what should we do ? "
42003013	" Don't collect any more than you are required to , " John told them .
42003014	Then some soldiers asked him , " And what should we do ? " John replied , " Don't force people to give you money . Don't bring false charges against people . Be happy with your pay . "
42003015	The people were waiting . They were expecting something . They were all wondering in their hearts if John might be the Christ .
42003016	John answered them all , " I baptize you with water . But One who is more powerful than I am will come . I'm not good enough to untie the straps of his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
42003017	His pitchfork is in his hand to toss the straw away from his threshing floor . He will gather the wheat into his storeroom . But he will burn up the husks with fire that can't be put out . "
42003018	John said many other things to warn the people . He also preached the good news to them .
42003019	But John found fault with Herod , the ruler of Galilee , because of Herodias . She was the wife of Herod's brother . John also spoke strongly to Herod about all the other evil things he had done .
42003020	So Herod locked him up in prison . He added this sin to all his others .
42003021	When all the people were being baptized , Jesus was baptized too . And as he was praying , heaven was opened .
42003022	The Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove . A voice came from heaven . It said , " You are my Son , and I love you . I am very pleased with you . "

42004001	Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan River . The Spirit led him into the desert .
42004002	There the devil tempted him for 40 days . Jesus ate nothing during that time . At the end of the 40 days , he was hungry .
42004003	The devil said to him , " If you are the Son of God , tell this stone to become bread . "
42004004	Jesus answered , " It is written , ' Man doesn't live only on bread . ' "
42004005	Then the devil led Jesus up to a high place . In an instant , he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world .
42004006	He said to him , " I will give you all their authority and glory . It has been given to me , and I can give it to anyone I want to .
42004007	So if you worship me , it will all be yours . "
42004008	Jesus answered , " It is written , ' Worship the Lord your God . He is the only one you should serve . ' "
42004009	Then the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem . He had him stand on the highest point of the temple . " If you are the Son of God , " he said , " throw yourself down from here .
42004010	It is written , " ' The Lord will command his angels to take good care of you .
42004011	They will lift you up in their hands . Then you won't trip over a stone . ' "
42004012	Jesus answered , " Scripture says , ' Do not put the Lord your God to the test . ' "
42004013	When the devil finished all this tempting , he left Jesus until a better time .
42004014	Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit . News about him spread through the whole countryside .
42004015	He taught in their synagogues , and everyone praised him .
42004016	Jesus went to Nazareth , where he had been brought up . On the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue as he usually did . And he stood up to read .
42004017	The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . He unrolled it and found the right place . There it is written ,
42004018	" The Spirit of the Lord is on me . He has anointed me to tell the good news to poor people . He has sent me to announce freedom for prisoners . He has sent me so that the blind will see again . He wants me to free those who are beaten down .
42004019	And he has sent me to announce the year when he will set his people free . "
42004020	Then Jesus rolled up the scroll . He gave it back to the attendant and sat down . The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were staring at him .
42004021	He began by saying to them , " Today this passage of Scripture is coming true as you listen . "
42004022	Everyone said good things about him . They were amazed at the gracious words they heard from his lips . " Isn't this Joseph's son ? " they asked .
42004023	Jesus said , " Here is a saying you will certainly apply to me . ' Doctor , heal yourself ! Do the things here in your hometown that we heard you did in Capernaum . ' "
42004024	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " he continued . " A prophet is not accepted in his hometown .
42004025	I tell you for sure that there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah . And there had been no rain for three and a half years . There wasn't enough food to eat anywhere in the land .
42004026	But Elijah was not sent to any of those widows . Instead , he was sent to a widow in Zarephath near Sidon .
42004027	And there were many in Israel who had skin diseases in the days of Elisha the prophet . But not one of them was healed except Naaman the Syrian . "
42004028	All the people in the synagogue were very angry when they heard that .
42004029	They got up and ran Jesus out of town . They took him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built . They planned to throw him down the cliff .
42004030	But Jesus walked right through the crowd and went on his way .
42004031	Then Jesus went to Capernaum , a town in Galilee . On the Sabbath day he began to teach the people .
42004032	They were amazed at his teaching , because his message had authority .
42004033	In the synagogue there was a man controlled by a demon , an evil spirit . He cried out at the top of his voice .
42004034	" Ha ! " he said . " What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are . You are the Holy One of God ! "
42004035	" Be quiet ! " Jesus said firmly . " Come out of him ! " Then the demon threw the man down in front of everybody . And it came out without hurting him .
42004036	All the people were amazed . They said to each other , " What is this teaching ? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits . And they come out ! "
42004037	The news about Jesus spread throughout the whole area .
42004038	Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon . At that time , Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever . So they asked Jesus to help her .
42004039	He bent over her and commanded the fever to leave , and it left her . She got up at once and began to serve them .
42004040	At sunset , people brought to Jesus all who were sick . He placed his hands on each one and healed them .
42004041	Also , demons came out of many people . The demons shouted , " You are the Son of God ! " But he commanded them to be quiet . He would not allow them to speak , because they knew he was the Christ .
42004042	At dawn , Jesus went out to a place where he could be by himself . The people went to look for him . When they found him , they tried to keep him from leaving them .
42004043	But he said , " I must announce the good news of God's kingdom to the other towns also . That is why I was sent . "
42004044	And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea .
42005001	One day Jesus was standing by the Sea of Galilee . The people crowded around him and listened to the word of God .
42005002	Jesus saw two boats at the edge of the water . They had been left there by the fishermen , who were washing their nets .
42005003	He got into the boat that belonged to Simon . Jesus asked him to go out a little way from shore . Then he sat down in the boat and taught the people .
42005004	When he finished speaking , he turned to Simon . He said , " Go out into deep water . Let the nets down so you can catch some fish . "
42005005	Simon answered , " Master , we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything . But because you say so , I will let down the nets . "
42005006	When they had done so , they caught a large number of fish . There were so many that their nets began to break .
42005007	So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . They came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw this , he fell at Jesus' knees . " Go away from me , Lord ! " he said . " I am a sinful man ! "
42005009	He and everyone with him were amazed at the number of fish they had caught .
42005010	So were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who worked with Simon . Then Jesus said to Simon , " Don't be afraid . From now on you will catch people . "
42005011	So they pulled their boats up on shore . Then they left everything and followed him .
42005012	While Jesus was in one of the towns , a man came along . He had a skin disease all over his body . When he saw Jesus , he fell with his face to the ground . He begged him , " Lord , if you are willing to make me ' clean , ' you can do it . "
42005013	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . " I am willing to do it , " he said . " Be ' clean ' ! " Right away the disease left him .
42005014	Then Jesus ordered him , " Don't tell anyone . Go and show yourself to the priest . Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded . It will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are ' clean . ' "
42005015	But the news about Jesus spread even more . So crowds of people came to hear him . They also came to be healed of their sicknesses .
42005016	But Jesus often went away to be by himself and pray .
42005017	One day Jesus was teaching . Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there . They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem . They heard that the Lord had given Jesus the power to heal the sick .
42005018	Some men came carrying a man who could not walk . He was lying on a mat . They tried to take him into the house to place him in front of Jesus .
42005019	They could not find a way to do this because of the crowd . So they went up on the roof . Then they lowered the man on his mat through the opening in the roof tiles . They lowered him into the middle of the crowd , right in front of Jesus .
42005020	When Jesus saw that they had faith , he said , " Friend , your sins are forgiven . "
42005021	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to think , " Who is this fellow who says such an evil thing ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? "
42005022	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he asked , " Why are you thinking these things in your hearts ?
42005023	Is it easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven ' ? Or to say , ' Get up and walk ' ?
42005024	I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . " So he spoke to the man who could not walk . " I tell you , " he said , " get up . Take your mat and go home . "
42005025	Right away , the man stood up in front of them . He took his mat and went home praising God .
42005026	Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God . They were filled with wonder . They said , " We have seen unusual things today . "
42005027	After this , Jesus left the house . He saw a tax collector sitting at the tax booth . The man's name was Levi . " Follow me , " Jesus said to him .
42005028	Levi got up , left everything and followed him .
42005029	Then Levi gave a huge dinner for Jesus at his house . A large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them .
42005030	But the Pharisees and their teachers of the law complained to Jesus' disciples . They said , " Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and ' sinners' ? "
42005031	Jesus answered them , " Those who are healthy don't need a doctor . Sick people do .
42005032	I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me . I have come to get sinners to turn away from their sins . "
42005033	Some of the people who were there said to Jesus , " John's disciples often pray and go without eating . So do the disciples of the Pharisees . But yours go on eating and drinking . "
42005034	Jesus answered , " Can you make the guests of the groom go without eating while he is with them ?
42005035	But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . In those days they will fast . "
42005036	Then Jesus gave them an example . He said , " People don't tear a patch from new clothes and sew it on old clothes . If they do , they will tear the new clothes . Also , the patch from the new clothes will not match the old clothes .
42005037	People don't pour new wine into old wineskins . If they do , the new wine will burst the skins . The wine will run out , and the wineskins will be destroyed .
42005038	No , new wine must be poured into new wineskins .
42005039	After people drink old wine , they don't want the new . They say , ' The old wine is better . ' "
42006001	One Sabbath day Jesus was walking through the grainfields . His disciples began to break off some heads of grain . They rubbed them in their hands and ate them .
42006002	Some of the Pharisees said , " It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath . Why are you doing it ? "
42006003	Jesus answered them , " Haven't you ever read about what David did ? He and his men were hungry .
42006004	He entered the house of God and took the holy bread . He ate the bread that only priests were allowed to eat . David also gave some to his men . "
42006005	Then Jesus said to them , " The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day . "
42006006	On another Sabbath day , Jesus went into the synagogue and was teaching . A man whose right hand was weak and twisted was there .
42006007	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were trying to find fault with Jesus . So they watched him closely . They wanted to see if he would heal on the Sabbath .
42006008	But Jesus knew what they were thinking . He spoke to the man who had the weak and twisted hand . " Get up and stand in front of everyone , " he said . So the man got up and stood there .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them , " What does the Law say we should do on the Sabbath day ? Should we do good ? Or should we do evil ? Should we save life ? Or should we destroy it ? "
42006010	He looked around at all of them . Then he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He did , and his hand was as good as new .
42006011	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were very angry . They began to talk to each other about what they might do to Jesus .
42006012	On one of those days , Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray . He spent the night praying to God .
42006013	When morning came , he called for his disciples to come to him . He chose 12 of them and made them apostles .
42006014	Simon was one of them . Jesus gave him the name Peter . There were also Simon's brother Andrew , James , John , Philip and Bartholomew .
42006015	And there were Matthew , Thomas , and James , son of Alphaeus . There were also Simon who was called the Zealot
42006016	and Judas , son of James . Judas Iscariot was one of them too . He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies .
42006017	Jesus went down the mountain with them and stood on a level place . A large crowd of his disciples was there . A large number of other people were there too . They came from all over Judea , including Jerusalem . They also came from the coast of Tyre and Sidon .
42006018	They had all come to hear Jesus and to be healed of their sicknesses . People who were troubled by evil spirits were made well .
42006019	Everyone tried to touch Jesus . Power was coming from him and healing them all .
42006020	Jesus looked at his disciples . He said to them , " Blessed are you who are needy . God's kingdom belongs to you .
42006021	Blessed are you who are hungry now . You will be satisfied . Blessed are you who are sad now . You will laugh .
42006022	Blessed are you when people hate you , when they have nothing to do with you and say bad things about you , and when they treat your name as something evil . They do all this because you are followers of the Son of Man .
42006023	" Their people treated the prophets the same way long ago . When these things happen to you , be glad and jump for joy . You will receive many blessings in heaven .
42006024	" But how terrible it will be for you who are rich ! You have already had your easy life .
42006025	How terrible for you who are well fed now ! You will go hungry . How terrible for you who laugh now ! You will cry and be sad .
42006026	How terrible for you when everyone says good things about you ! Their people treated the false prophets the same way long ago .
42006027	" But here is what I tell you who hear me . Love your enemies . Do good to those who hate you .
42006028	Bless those who call down curses on you . And pray for those who treat you badly .
42006029	" Suppose someone hits you on one cheek . Turn your other cheek to him also . Suppose someone takes your coat . Don't stop him from taking your shirt .
42006030	" Give to everyone who asks you . And if anyone takes what belongs to you , don't ask to get it back .
42006031	Do to others as you want them to do to you .
42006032	" Suppose you love those who love you . Should anyone praise you for that ? Even ' sinners' love those who love them .
42006033	And suppose you do good to those who are good to you . Should anyone praise you for that ? Even ' sinners' do that .
42006034	And suppose you lend money to those who can pay you back . Should anyone praise you for that ? Even a ' sinner ' lends to ' sinners , ' expecting them to pay everything back .
42006035	" But love your enemies . Do good to them . Lend to them without expecting to get anything back . Then you will receive a lot in return . And you will be sons of the Most High God . He is kind to people who are evil and are not thankful .
42006036	So have mercy , just as your Father has mercy .
42006037	" If you do not judge others , then you will not be judged . If you do not find others guilty , then you will not be found guilty . Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you . A good amount will be poured into your lap . It will be pressed down , shaken together , and running over . The same amount you give will be measured out to you . "
42006039	Jesus also gave them another example . He asked , " Can a blind person lead another blind person ? Won't they both fall into a pit ?
42006040	Students are not better than their teachers . But everyone who is completely trained will be like his teacher .
42006041	" You look at the bit of sawdust in your friend's eye . But you pay no attention to the piece of wood in your own eye .
42006042	How can you say to your friend , ' Let me take the bit of sawdust out of your eye ' ? How can you say this while there is a piece of wood in your own eye ? You pretender ! First take the piece of wood out of your own eye . Then you will be able to see clearly to take the bit of sawdust out of your friend's eye .
42006043	" A good tree doesn't bear bad fruit . And a bad tree doesn't bear good fruit .
42006044	You can tell each tree by the kind of fruit it bears . People do not pick figs from thorns . And they don't pick grapes from bushes .
42006045	" A good man says good things . These come from the good that is put away in his heart . An evil man says evil things . These come from the evil that is put away in his heart . Their mouths say everything that is in their hearts .
42006046	" Why do you call me , ' Lord , Lord , ' and still don't do what I say ?
42006047	Some people come to me and listen to me and do what I say . I will show you what they are like .
42006048	They are like someone who builds a house . He digs down deep and sets it on solid rock . When a flood comes , the river rushes against the house . But the water can't shake it . The house is well built .
42006049	" But here is what happens when people listen to my words and do not obey them . They are like someone who builds a house on soft ground instead of solid rock . The moment the river rushes against that house , it falls down . It is completely destroyed . "
42007001	Jesus finished saying all those things to the people . Then he entered Capernaum .
42007002	There the servant of a Roman commander was sick and about to die . His master thought highly of him .
42007003	The commander heard about Jesus . So he sent some elders of the Jews to him . He told them to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant .
42007004	They came to Jesus and begged him , " This man deserves to have you do this .
42007005	He loves our nation and has built our synagogue . "
42007006	So Jesus went with them . When Jesus came near the house , the Roman commander sent friends to him . He told them to say , " Lord , don't trouble yourself . I am not good enough to have you come into my house .
42007007	That is why I did not even think I was fit to come to you . But just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
42007008	I myself am a man who is under authority . And I have soldiers who obey my orders . I tell this one , ' Go , ' and he goes . I tell that one , ' Come , ' and he comes . I say to my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
42007009	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed at him . He turned to the crowd that was following him . He said , " I tell you , even in Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong . "
42007010	Then the men who had been sent to Jesus returned to the house . They found that the servant was healed .
42007011	Some time later , Jesus went to a town called Nain . His disciples and a large crowd went along with him .
42007012	He approached the town gate . Just then , a dead person was being carried out . He was the only son of his mother . She was a widow . A large crowd from the town was with her .
42007013	When the Lord saw her , he felt sorry for her . So he said , " Don't cry . "
42007014	Then he went up and touched the coffin . Those carrying it stood still . Jesus said , " Young man , I say to you , get up ! "
42007015	The dead man sat up and began to talk . Then Jesus gave him back to his mother .
42007016	The people were all filled with wonder and praised God . " A great prophet has appeared among us , " they said . " God has come to help his people . "
42007017	This news about Jesus spread all through Judea and the whole country .
42007018	John's disciples told him about all these things . So he chose two of them .
42007019	He sent them to the Lord . They were to ask Jesus , " Are you the one who was supposed to come ? Or should we look for someone else ? "
42007020	The men came to Jesus . They said , " John the Baptist sent us to ask you , ' Are you the one who was supposed to come ? Or should we look for someone else ? ' "
42007021	At that very time Jesus healed many people . They had illnesses , sicknesses and evil spirits . He also gave sight to many who were blind .
42007022	So Jesus replied to the messengers , " Go back to John . Tell him what you have seen and heard . Blind people receive sight . Disabled people walk . Those who have skin diseases are healed . Deaf people hear . Those who are dead are raised to life . And the good news is preached to those who are poor .
42007023	Blessed are those who do not give up their faith because of me . "
42007024	So John's messengers left . Then Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John . He said , " What did you go out into the desert to see ? Tall grass waving in the wind ?
42007025	If not , what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No . Those who wear fine clothes and have many expensive things are in palaces .
42007026	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	" He is the one written about in Scripture . It says , " ' I will send my messenger ahead of you . He will prepare your way for you . '
42007028	I tell you , no one more important than John has ever been born . But the least important person in God's kingdom is more important than he is . "
42007029	All the people who heard Jesus' words agreed that God's way was right . Even the tax collectors agreed . These people had all been baptized by John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the authorities on the law did not accept God's purpose for themselves . They had not been baptized by John .
42007031	" What can I compare today's people to ? " Jesus asked . " What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the market place and calling out to each other . They say , " ' We played a flute for you . But you didn't dance . We sang a funeral song . But you didn't cry . '
42007033	" That is how it has been with John the Baptist . When he came to you , he didn't eat bread or drink wine . And you say , ' He has a demon . '
42007034	But when the Son of Man came , he ate and drank as you do . And you say , ' This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much . He's a friend of tax collectors and " sinners . " '
42007035	All who follow wisdom prove that wisdom is right . "
42007036	One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him . So he went to the Pharisee's house . He took his place at the table .
42007037	There was a woman in that town who had lived a sinful life . She learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house . So she came with a special sealed jar of perfume .
42007038	She stood behind Jesus and cried at his feet . She began to wet his feet with her tears . Then she wiped them with her hair . She kissed them and poured perfume on them .
42007039	The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this . He said to himself , " If this man were a prophet , he would know who is touching him . He would know what kind of woman she is . She is a sinner ! "
42007040	Jesus answered him , " Simon , I have something to tell you . " " Tell me , teacher , " he said .
42007041	" Two people owed money to a certain lender . One owed him 500 silver coins . The other owed him 50 silver coins .
42007042	Neither of them had the money to pay him back . So he let them go without paying . Which of them will love him more ? "
42007043	Simon replied , " I suppose the one who owed the most money . " " You are right , " Jesus said .
42007044	Then he turned toward the woman . He said to Simon , " Do you see this woman ? I came into your house . You did not give me any water to wash my feet . But she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You did not give me a kiss . But this woman has not stopped kissing my feet since I came in .
42007046	You did not put any olive oil on my head . But she has poured perfume on my feet .
42007047	So I tell you this . Her many sins have been forgiven . She has loved a lot . But the one who has been forgiven little loves only a little . "
42007048	Then Jesus said to her , " Your sins are forgiven . "
42007049	The other guests began to talk about this among themselves . They said , " Who is this who even forgives sins ? "
42007050	Jesus said to the woman , " Your faith has saved you . Go in peace . "
42008001	After this , Jesus traveled around from one town and village to another . He announced the good news of God's kingdom . The Twelve were with him .
42008002	So were some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses . One was Mary Magdalene . Seven demons had come out of her .
42008003	Another was Joanna , the wife of Cuza . He was the manager of Herod's household . Susanna and many others were there also . These women were helping to support Jesus and the Twelve with their own money .
42008004	A large crowd gathered together . People came to Jesus from town after town . As they did , he told a story . He said ,
42008005	" A farmer went out to plant his seed . He scattered the seed on the ground . Some fell on a path . People walked on it , and the birds of the air ate it up .
42008006	Some seed fell on rocky places . When it grew , the plants dried up because they had no water .
42008007	Other seed fell among thorns . The thorns grew up with it and crowded out the plants .
42008008	Still other seed fell on good soil . It grew up and produced a crop 100 times more than the farmer planted . " When Jesus said this , he called out , " Those who have ears should listen . "
42008009	His disciples asked him what the story meant .
42008010	He said , " You have been given the chance to understand the secrets of God's kingdom . But to outsiders I speak by using stories . In that way , " ' They see , but they will not know what they are seeing . They hear , but they will not understand what they are hearing . '
42008011	" Here is what the story means . The seed is God's message .
42008012	People on the path are those who hear . But then the devil comes . He takes away the message from their hearts . He does it so they won't believe . Then they can't be saved .
42008013	Those on the rock are the ones who hear the message and receive it with joy . But they have no roots . They believe for a while . But when they are put to the test , they fall away from the faith .
42008014	The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear the message . But as they go on their way , they are choked by life's worries , riches and pleasures . So they do not reach full growth .
42008015	" But the seed on good soil stands for those with an honest and good heart . They hear the message . They keep it in their hearts . They remain faithful and produce a good crop .
42008016	" People do not light a lamp and then hide it in a jar or put it under a bed . Instead , they put it on a stand . Then those who come in can see its light .
42008017	What is hidden will be seen . And what is out of sight will be brought into the open and made known .
42008018	" So be careful how you listen . If you have something , you will be given more . If you have nothing , even what you think you have will be taken away from you . "
42008019	Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him . But they could not get near him because of the crowd .
42008020	Someone told him , " Your mother and brothers are standing outside . They want to see you . "
42008021	He replied , " My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and do what it says . "
42008022	One day Jesus said to his disciples , " Let's go over to the other side of the lake . " So they got into a boat and left .
42008023	As they sailed , Jesus fell asleep . A storm came down on the lake . It was so bad that the boat was about to sink . They were in great danger .
42008024	The disciples went and woke Jesus up . They said , " Master ! Master ! We're going to drown ! " He got up and ordered the wind and the huge waves to stop . The storm quieted down . It was completely calm .
42008025	" Where is your faith ? " he asked his disciples . They were amazed and full of fear . They asked one another , " Who is this ? He commands even the winds and the waves , and they obey him . "
42008026	Jesus and his disciples sailed to the area of the Gerasenes across the lake from Galilee .
42008027	When Jesus stepped on shore , he was met by a man from the town . The man was controlled by demons . For a long time he had not worn clothes or lived in a house . He lived in the tombs .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell at his feet . He shouted at the top of his voice , " Jesus , Son of the Most High God , what do you want with me ? I beg you , don't hurt me ! "
42008029	This was because Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man . Many times the spirit had taken hold of him . His hands and feet were chained , and he was kept under guard . But he had broken his chains . And then the demon had forced him to go out into lonely places in the countryside .
42008030	Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " " Legion , " he replied , because many demons had gone into him .
42008031	And they begged Jesus again and again not to order them to go into the Abyss .
42008032	A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside . The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs . And he allowed it .
42008033	When the demons came out of the man , they went into the pigs . Then the herd rushed down the steep bank . They ran into the lake and drowned .
42008034	Those who were tending the pigs saw what had happened . They ran off and reported it in the town and countryside .
42008035	The people went out to see what had happened . Then they came to Jesus . They found the man who was now free of the demons . He was sitting at Jesus' feet . He was dressed and thinking clearly . All this made the people afraid .
42008036	Those who had seen it told the others how the man who had been controlled by demons was now healed .
42008037	Then all the people who lived in the area of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them . They were filled with fear . So he got into the boat and left .
42008038	The man who was now free of the demons begged to go with him . But Jesus sent him away . He said to him ,
42008039	" Return home and tell how much God has done for you . " So the man went away . He told people all over town how much Jesus had done for him .
42008040	When Jesus returned , a crowd welcomed him . They were all expecting him .
42008041	Then a man named Jairus came . He was a synagogue ruler . He fell at Jesus' feet . He begged Jesus to come to his house .
42008042	His only daughter was dying . She was about 12 years old . As Jesus was on his way , the crowds almost crushed him .
42008043	A woman was there who had a sickness that made her bleed . Her sickness had lasted for 12 years . No one could heal her .
42008044	She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his clothes . Right away her bleeding stopped .
42008045	" Who touched me ? " Jesus asked . They all said they didn't do it . Then Peter said , " Master , the people are crowding and pushing against you . "
42008046	But Jesus said , " Someone touched me . I know that power has gone out from me . "
42008047	The woman realized that people would notice her . Shaking with fear , she came and fell at his feet . In front of everyone , she told why she had touched him . She also told how she had been healed in an instant .
42008048	Then he said to her , " Dear woman , your faith has healed you . Go in peace . "
42008049	While Jesus was still speaking , someone came from the house of Jairus . Jairus was the synagogue ruler . " Your daughter is dead , " the messenger said . " Don't bother the teacher anymore . "
42008050	Hearing this , Jesus said to Jairus , " Don't be afraid . Just believe . She will be healed . "
42008051	When he arrived at the house of Jairus , he did not let everyone go in with him . He took only Peter , John and James , and the child's father and mother .
42008052	During this time , all the people were crying and sobbing loudly over the child . " Stop crying ! " Jesus said . " She is not dead . She is sleeping . "
42008053	They laughed at him . They knew she was dead .
42008054	But he took her by the hand and said , " My child , get up ! "
42008055	Her spirit returned , and right away she stood up . Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat .
42008056	Her parents were amazed . But Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened .
42009001	Jesus called the Twelve together . He gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to heal sicknesses .
42009002	Then he sent them out to preach about God's kingdom and to heal those who were sick .
42009003	He told them , " Don't take anything for the journey . Do not take a walking stick or a bag . Do not take any bread , money or extra clothes .
42009004	When you are invited into a house , stay there until you leave town .
42009005	Some people may not welcome you . If they don't , shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town . This will be a witness against the people living there . "
42009006	So the Twelve left . They went from village to village . They preached the good news and healed people everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod , the ruler of Galilee , heard about everything that was going on . He was bewildered , because some were saying that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead .
42009008	Others were saying that Elijah had appeared . Still others were saying that a prophet of long ago had come back to life .
42009009	But Herod said , " I had John's head cut off . So who is it that I hear such things about ? " And he tried to see Jesus .
42009010	The apostles returned . They told Jesus what they had done . Then he took them with him . They went off by themselves to a town called Bethsaida .
42009011	But the crowds learned about it and followed Jesus . He welcomed them and spoke to them about God's kingdom . He also healed those who needed to be healed .
42009012	Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him . They said , " Send the crowd away . They can go to the nearby villages and countryside . There they can find food and a place to stay . There is nothing here . "
42009013	Jesus replied , " You give them something to eat . " The disciples answered , " We have only five loaves of bread and two fish . We would have to go and buy food for all this crowd . "
42009014	About 5,000 men were there . But Jesus said to his disciples , " Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each . "
42009015	The disciples did so , and everyone sat down .
42009016	Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up to heaven and gave thanks . He broke them into pieces . Then he gave them to the disciples to set in front of the people .
42009017	All of them ate and were satisfied . The disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftover pieces .
42009018	One day Jesus was praying alone . Only his disciples were with him . He asked them , " Who do the crowds say I am ? "
42009019	They replied , " Some say John the Baptist . Others say Elijah . Still others say that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life . "
42009020	" But what about you ? " he asked . " Who do you say I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
42009021	Jesus strongly warned them not to tell this to anyone .
42009022	He said , " The Son of Man must suffer many things . The elders will not accept him . The chief priests and teachers of the law will not accept him either . He must be killed and on the third day rise from the dead . "
42009023	Then he said to all of them , " If anyone wants to follow me , he must say no to himself . He must pick up his cross every day and follow me .
42009024	If he wants to save his life , he will lose it . But if he loses his life for me , he will save it .
42009025	What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses or gives up his very self ?
42009026	" Suppose you are ashamed of me and my words . The Son of Man will come in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels . Then he will be ashamed of you .
42009027	" What I'm about to tell you is true . Some who are standing here will not die before they see God's kingdom . "
42009028	About eight days after Jesus said this , he went up on a mountain to pray . He took Peter , John and James with him .
42009029	As he was praying , the appearance of his face changed . His clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning .
42009030	Two men , Moses and Elijah ,
42009031	appeared in shining glory . Jesus and the two of them talked together . They spoke about his coming death . He was going to die soon in Jerusalem .
42009032	Peter and his companions had been very sleepy . But then they became completely awake . They saw Jesus' glory and the two men standing with him .
42009033	As the men were leaving Jesus , Peter spoke up . " Master , " he said to him , " it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three shelters . One will be for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . " He didn't really know what he was saying .
42009034	While Jesus was speaking , a cloud appeared . It surrounded them . The disciples were afraid as they entered the cloud .
42009035	A voice came from the cloud . It said , " This is my Son , and I have chosen him . Listen to him . "
42009036	When the voice had spoken , they found that Jesus was alone . The disciples kept quiet about this . They didn't tell anyone at that time what they had seen .
42009037	The next day Jesus and those who were with him came down from the mountain . A large crowd met Jesus .
42009038	A man in the crowd called out . " Teacher , " he said , " I beg you to look at my son . He is my only child .
42009039	A spirit takes hold of him , and he suddenly screams . It throws him into fits so that he foams at the mouth . It hardly ever leaves him . It is destroying him .
42009040	I begged your disciples to drive it out . But they couldn't do it . "
42009041	" You unbelieving and evil people ! " Jesus replied . " How long do I have to stay with you ? How long do I have to put up with you ? " Then he said to the man , " Bring your son here . "
42009042	Even while the boy was coming , the demon threw him into a fit . The boy fell to the ground . But Jesus ordered the evil spirit to leave the boy . Then Jesus healed him and gave him back to his father .
42009043	They were all amazed at God's greatness . Everyone was wondering about all that Jesus did . Then Jesus said to his disciples ,
42009044	" Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you . The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men . "
42009045	But they didn't understand what this meant . That was because it was hidden from them . And they were afraid to ask Jesus about it .
42009046	The disciples began to argue about which one of them would be the most important person .
42009047	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he took a little child and had the child stand beside him .
42009048	Then he spoke to them . " Anyone who welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me , " he said . " And anyone who welcomes me welcomes the One who sent me . The least important person among all of you is the most important . "
42009049	" Master , " said John , " we saw a man driving out demons in your name . We tried to stop him , because he is not one of us . "
42009050	" Do not stop him , " Jesus said . " Anyone who is not against you is for you . "
42009051	The time grew near for Jesus to be taken up to heaven . So he made up his mind to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	He sent messengers on ahead . They went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him .
42009053	But the people there did not welcome Jesus . That was because he was heading for Jerusalem .
42009054	The disciples James and John saw this . They asked , " Lord , do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy them ? "
42009055	But Jesus turned and commanded them not to do it .
42009056	They went on to another village .
42009057	Once Jesus and those who were with him were walking along the road . A man said to Jesus , " I will follow you no matter where you go . "
42009058	Jesus replied , " Foxes have holes . Birds of the air have nests . But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
42009059	He said to another man , " Follow me . " But the man replied , " Lord , first let me go and bury my father . "
42009060	Jesus said to him , " Let dead people bury their own dead . You go and tell others about God's kingdom . "
42009061	Still another man said , " I will follow you , Lord . But first let me go back and say good-by to my family . "
42009062	Jesus replied , " Suppose you start to plow and then look back . If you do , you are not fit for service in God's kingdom . "
42010001	After this the Lord appointed 72 others . He sent them out two by two ahead of him . They went to every town and place where he was about to go .
42010002	He told them , " The harvest is huge , but the workers are few . So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field .
42010003	" Go ! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves .
42010004	Do not take a purse or bag or sandals . And don't greet anyone on the road .
42010005	" When you enter a house , first say , ' May this house be blessed with peace . '
42010006	If someone there loves peace , your blessing of peace will rest on him . If not , it will return to you .
42010007	Stay in that house . Eat and drink anything they give you . Workers are worthy of their pay . Do not move around from house to house .
42010008	" When you enter a town and are welcomed , eat what is set down in front of you .
42010009	Heal the sick people who are there . Tell them , ' God's kingdom is near you . '
42010010	" But what if you enter a town and are not welcomed ? Then go into its streets and say ,
42010011	' We wipe off even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet . We do it to show that God isn't pleased with you . But here is what you can be sure of . God's kingdom is near . '
42010012	" I tell you this . On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for that town .
42010013	" How terrible it will be for you , Korazin ! How terrible for you , Bethsaida ! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon . They would have turned away from their sins long ago . They would have put on black clothes . They would have sat down in ashes .
42010014	On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
42010015	" And what about you , Capernaum ? Will you be lifted up to heaven ? No ! You will go down to the place of the dead .
42010016	" Anyone who listens to you listens to me . Anyone who does not accept you does not accept me . And anyone who does not accept me does not accept the One who sent me . "
42010017	The 72 returned with joy . They said , " Lord , even the demons obey us when we speak in your name . "
42010018	Jesus replied , " I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	I have given you authority to walk all over snakes and scorpions . You will be able to destroy all the power of the enemy . Nothing will harm you .
42010020	But do not be glad when the evil spirits obey you . Instead , be glad that your names are written in heaven . "
42010021	At that time Jesus was full of joy through the Holy Spirit . He said , " I praise you , Father . You are Lord of heaven and earth . You have hidden these things from the wise and educated . But you have shown them to little children . Yes , Father . This is what you wanted .
42010022	" My Father has given all things to me . The Father is the only one who knows who the Son is . And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make the Father known . "
42010023	Then Jesus turned to his disciples . He said to them in private , " Blessed are the eyes that see what you see .
42010024	I tell you , many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see . But they didn't see it . They wanted to hear what you hear . But they didn't hear it . "
42010025	One day an authority on the law stood up to put Jesus to the test . " Teacher , " he asked , " what must I do to receive eternal life ? "
42010026	" What is written in the Law ? " Jesus replied . " How do you understand it ? "
42010027	He answered , " ' Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Love him with all your strength and with all your mind . ' And , ' Love your neighbor as you love yourself . ' "
42010028	" You have answered correctly , " Jesus replied . " Do that , and you will live . "
42010029	But the man wanted to make himself look good . So he asked Jesus , " And who is my neighbor ? "
42010030	Jesus replied , " A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho . Robbers attacked him . They stripped off his clothes and beat him . Then they went away , leaving him almost dead .
42010031	A priest happened to be going down that same road . When he saw the man , he passed by on the other side .
42010032	A Levite also came by . When he saw the man , he passed by on the other side too .
42010033	But a Samaritan came to the place where the man was . When he saw the man , he felt sorry for him .
42010034	He went to him , poured olive oil and wine on his wounds and bandaged them . Then he put the man on his own donkey . He took him to an inn and took care of him .
42010035	The next day he took out two silver coins . He gave them to the owner of the inn . ' Take care of him , ' he said . ' When I return , I will pay you back for any extra expense you may have . '
42010036	" Which of the three do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by robbers ? "
42010037	The authority on the law replied , " The one who felt sorry for him . " Jesus told him , " Go and do as he did . "
42010038	Jesus and his disciples went on their way . Jesus came to a village where a woman named Martha lived . She welcomed him into her home .
42010039	She had a sister named Mary . Mary sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said .
42010040	But Martha was busy with all the things that had to be done . She came to Jesus and said , " Lord , my sister has left me to do the work by myself . Don't you care ? Tell her to help me ! "
42010041	" Martha , Martha , " the Lord answered . " You are worried and upset about many things .
42010042	But only one thing is needed . Mary has chosen what is better . And it will not be taken away from her . "
42011001	One day Jesus was praying in a certain place . When he finished , one of his disciples spoke to him . " Lord , " he said , " teach us to pray , just as John taught his disciples . "
42011002	Jesus said to them , " When you pray , this is what you should say . " ' Father , may your name be honored . May your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us each day our daily bread .
42011004	Forgive us our sins , as we also forgive everyone who sins against us . Keep us from falling into sin when we are tempted . ' "
42011005	Then Jesus said to them , " Suppose someone has a friend . He goes to him at midnight . He says , ' Friend , lend me three loaves of bread .
42011006	A friend of mine on a journey has come to stay with me . I have nothing for him to eat . '
42011007	" Then the one inside answers , ' Don't bother me . The door is already locked . My children are with me in bed . I can't get up and give you anything . '
42011008	" I tell you , that person will not get up . And he won't give the man bread just because he is his friend . But because the man keeps on asking , he will get up . He will give him as much as he needs .
42011009	" So here is what I say to you . Ask , and it will be given to you . Search , and you will find . Knock , and the door will be opened to you .
42011010	Everyone who asks will receive . He who searches will find . And the door will be opened to the one who knocks .
42011011	" Fathers , suppose your son asks for a fish . Which of you will give him a snake instead ?
42011012	Or suppose he asks for an egg . Which of you will give him a scorpion ?
42011013	Even though you are evil , you know how to give good gifts to your children . How much more will your Father who is in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! "
42011014	Jesus was driving out a demon . The man who had the demon could not speak . When the demon left , the man began to speak . The crowd was amazed .
42011015	But some of them said , " Jesus is driving out demons by the power of Beelzebub , the prince of demons . "
42011016	Others put Jesus to the test by asking for a miraculous sign from heaven .
42011017	Jesus knew what they were thinking . So he said to them , " Any kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed . A family that is divided against itself will fall .
42011018	If Satan fights against himself , how can his kingdom stand ? " I say this because of what you claim . You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub .
42011019	Suppose I do drive out demons with Beelzebub's help . With whose help do your followers drive them out ? So then , they will be your judges .
42011020	But suppose I drive out demons with the help of God's powerful finger . Then God's kingdom has come to you .
42011021	" When a strong man is completely armed and guards his house , what he owns is safe .
42011022	But when someone stronger attacks , he is overpowered . The attacker takes away the armor the man had trusted in . Then he divides up what he has stolen .
42011023	" Anyone who is not with me is against me . Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them .
42011024	" What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man ? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest . But it doesn't find it . Then it says , ' I will return to the house I left . '
42011025	When it arrives there , it finds the house swept clean and put in order .
42011026	Then the evil spirit goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself . They go in and live there . That man is worse off than before . "
42011027	As Jesus was saying these things , a woman in the crowd called out . She shouted , " Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you . "
42011028	He replied , " Instead , blessed are those who hear God's word and obey it . "
42011029	As the crowds grew larger , Jesus spoke to them . " The people of today are evil , " he said . " They ask for a miraculous sign from God . But none will be given except the sign of Jonah .
42011030	He was a sign from God to the people of Nineveh . In the same way , the Son of Man will be a sign from God to the people of today .
42011031	" The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the men now living . And she will prove that they are guilty . She came from very far away to listen to Solomon's wisdom . And now one who is more important than Solomon is here .
42011032	" The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living . And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty . The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them . And now one who is more important than Jonah is here .
42011033	" No one lights a lamp and hides it . No one puts it under a bowl . Instead , people put a lamp on its stand . Then those who come in can see the light .
42011034	" Your eye is like a lamp for your body . Suppose your eyes are good . Then your whole body also is full of light . But suppose your eyes are bad . Then your body also is full of darkness .
42011035	So make sure that the light inside you is not darkness .
42011036	" Suppose your whole body is full of light . And suppose no part of it is dark . Then your body will be completely lit up . It will be as when the light of a lamp shines on you . "
42011037	Jesus finished speaking . Then a Pharisee invited him to eat with him . So Jesus went in and took his place at the table .
42011038	But the Pharisee noticed that Jesus did not wash before the meal . He was surprised .
42011039	Then the Lord spoke to him . " You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish , " he said . " But inside you are full of greed and evil .
42011040	You foolish people ! Didn't the one who made the outside make the inside also ?
42011041	Give to poor people what is inside the dish . Then everything will be clean for you .
42011042	" How terrible it will be for you Pharisees ! You give God a tenth of your garden plants , such as mint and rue . But you have forgotten to be fair and to love God . You should have practiced the last things without failing to do the first .
42011043	" How terrible for you Pharisees ! You love the most important seats in the synagogues . You love having people greet you in the market places .
42011044	" How terrible for you ! You are like graves that are not marked . People walk over them without knowing it . "
42011045	An authority on the law spoke to Jesus . He said , " Teacher , when you say things like that , you say bad things about us too . "
42011046	Jesus replied , " How terrible for you authorities on the law ! You put such heavy loads on people that they can hardly carry them . But you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them .
42011047	" How terrible for you ! You build tombs for the prophets . It was your people of long ago who killed them .
42011048	So you give witness that you agree with what your people did long ago . They killed the prophets , and now you build the prophets' tombs .
42011049	" So God in his wisdom said , ' I will send prophets and apostles to them . They will kill some . And they will try to hurt others . '
42011050	So the people of today will be punished . They will pay for all the prophets' blood spilled since the world began .
42011051	I mean from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who was killed between the altar and the temple . Yes , I tell you , the people of today will be punished for all these things .
42011052	" How terrible for you authorities on the law ! You have taken away the key to the door of knowledge . You yourselves have not entered . And you have stood in the way of those who were entering . "
42011053	When Jesus left there , the Pharisees and the teachers of the law strongly opposed him . They threw a lot of questions at him .
42011054	They set traps for him . They wanted to catch him in something he might say .
42012001	During that time a crowd of many thousands had gathered . There were so many people that they were stepping on one another . Jesus spoke first to his disciples . " Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees , " he said . " They just pretend to be godly .
42012002	Everything that is secret will be brought out into the open . Everything that is hidden will be uncovered .
42012003	What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight . What you have whispered to someone behind closed doors will be shouted from the rooftops .
42012004	" My friends , listen to me . Don't be afraid of those who kill the body but can't do any more than that .
42012005	I will show you whom you should be afraid of . Be afraid of the One who can kill the body and also has the power to throw you into hell . Yes , I tell you , be afraid of him .
42012006	" Aren't five sparrows sold for two pennies ? But God does not forget even one of them .
42012007	In fact , he even counts every hair on your head ! So don't be afraid . You are worth more than many sparrows .
42012008	" What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me ? I tell you , the Son of Man will say that he knows that person in front of God's angels .
42012009	But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me ? I , the Son of Man , will say that I don't know him in front of God's angels .
42012010	" Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven . But anyone who speaks evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	" You will be brought before synagogues , rulers and authorities . But do not worry about how to stand up for yourselves or what to say .
42012012	The Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say . "
42012013	Someone in the crowd spoke to Jesus . " Teacher , " he said , " tell my brother to divide the family property with me . "
42012014	Jesus replied , " Friend , who made me a judge or umpire between you ? "
42012015	Then he said to them , " Watch out ! Be on your guard against wanting to have more and more things . Life is not made up of how much a person has . "
42012016	Then Jesus told them a story . He said , " A certain rich man's land produced a good crop .
42012017	He thought to himself , ' What should I do ? I don't have any place to store my crops . '
42012018	" Then he said , ' This is what I'll do . I will tear down my storerooms and build bigger ones . I will store all my grain and my other things in them .
42012019	I'll say to myself , " You have plenty of good things stored away for many years . Take life easy . Eat , drink and have a good time . " '
42012020	" But God said to him , ' You foolish man ! This very night I will take your life away from you . Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself ? '
42012021	" That is how it will be for anyone who stores things away for himself but is not rich in God's eyes . "
42012022	Then Jesus spoke to his disciples . He said , " I tell you , do not worry . Don't worry about your life and what you will eat . And don't worry about your body and what you will wear .
42012023	There is more to life than eating . There are more important things for the body than clothes .
42012024	" Think about the ravens . They don't plant or gather crops . They don't have any storerooms at all . But God feeds them . You are worth much more than birds !
42012025	" Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying ?
42012026	You can't do that very little thing . So why worry about the rest ?
42012027	" Think about how the lilies grow . They don't work or make clothing . But here is what I tell you . Not even Solomon in all of his glory was dressed like one of those flowers .
42012028	If that is how God dresses the wild grass , how much better will he dress you ! After all , the grass is here only today . Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire . Your faith is so small !
42012029	" Don't spend time thinking about what you will eat or drink . Don't worry about it .
42012030	People who are ungodly run after all of those things . Your Father knows that you need them .
42012031	" But put God's kingdom first . Then those other things will also be given to you .
42012032	" Little flock , do not be afraid . Your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell what you own . Give to those who are poor . Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out . Put away riches in heaven that will not be used up . There , no thief can come near it . There , no moth can destroy it .
42012034	Your heart will be where your riches are .
42012035	" Be dressed and ready to serve . Keep your lamps burning .
42012036	Be like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding dinner . When he comes and knocks , they can open the door for him at once .
42012037	" It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready when he comes . What I'm about to tell you is true . The master will then dress himself so he can serve them . He will have them take their places at the table . And he will come and wait on them .
42012038	It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready . It will even be good if he comes very late at night .
42012039	" But here is what you must understand . Suppose the owner of the house knew at what hour the robber was coming . He would not have let his house be broken into .
42012040	You also must be ready . The Son of Man will come at an hour when you don't expect him . "
42012041	Peter asked , " Lord , are you telling this story to us , or to everyone ? "
42012042	The Lord answered , " Suppose a master puts one of his servants in charge of his other servants . The servant's job is to give them the food they are to receive at the right time . The master wants a faithful and wise manager for this .
42012043	It will be good for the servant if the master finds him doing his job when the master returns .
42012044	What I'm about to tell you is true . The master will put that servant in charge of everything he owns .
42012045	" But suppose the servant says to himself , ' My master is taking a long time to come back . ' Suppose he begins to beat the other servants . Suppose he feeds himself . And suppose he drinks until he gets drunk .
42012046	The master of that servant will come back on a day the servant doesn't expect him . He will return at an hour the servant doesn't know . Then the master will cut him to pieces . He will send him to the place where unbelievers go .
42012047	" Suppose a servant knows his master's wishes . But he doesn't get ready . And he doesn't do what his master wants . That servant will be beaten with many blows .
42012048	" But suppose the servant does not know his master's wishes . And suppose he does things for which he should be punished . He will be beaten with only a few blows . " Much will be required of everyone who has been given much . Even more will be asked of the person who is supposed to take care of much .
42012049	" I have come to bring fire on the earth . How I wish the fire had already started !
42012050	But I have a baptism of suffering to go through . And I will be very troubled until it is completed .
42012051	" Do you think I came to bring peace on earth ? No , I tell you . I have come to separate people .
42012052	From now on there will be five members in a family , each one against the other . There will be three against two and two against three .
42012053	They will be separated . Father will turn against son and son against father . Mother will turn against daughter and daughter against mother . Mother-in-law will turn against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . "
42012054	Jesus spoke to the crowd . He said , " You see a cloud rising in the west . Right away you say , ' It's going to rain . ' And it does .
42012055	The south wind blows . So you say , ' It's going to be hot . ' And it is .
42012056	You pretenders ! You know how to understand the appearance of the earth and the sky . Why can't you understand the meaning of what is happening right now ?
42012057	" Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	Suppose someone has a claim against you , and you are on your way to court . Try hard to settle the matter on the way . If you don't , that person may drag you off to the judge . The judge may turn you over to the officer . And the officer may throw you into prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny ! "
42013001	Some people who were there at that time told Jesus about certain Galileans . Pilate had mixed their blood with their sacrifices .
42013002	Jesus said , " These people from Galilee suffered greatly . Do you think they were worse sinners than all the other Galileans ?
42013003	I tell you , no ! But unless you turn away from your sins , you will all die too .
42013004	Or what about the 18 people in Siloam ? They died when the tower fell on them . Do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem ?
42013005	I tell you , no ! But unless you turn away from your sins , you will all die too . "
42013006	Then Jesus told a story . " A man had a fig tree , " he said . " It had been planted in his vineyard . When he went to look for fruit on it , he didn't find any .
42013007	So he went to the man who took care of the vineyard . He said , ' For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree . But I haven't found any . Cut it down ! Why should it use up the soil ? '
42013008	" ' Sir , ' the man replied , ' leave it alone for one more year . I'll dig around it and feed it .
42013009	If it bears fruit next year , fine ! If not , then cut it down . ' "
42013010	Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on a Sabbath day .
42013011	A woman there had been disabled by an evil spirit for 18 years . She was bent over and could not stand up straight .
42013012	Jesus saw her . He asked her to come to him . He said to her , " Woman , you will no longer be disabled . I am about to set you free . "
42013013	Then he put his hands on her . Right away she stood up straight and praised God .
42013014	Jesus had healed the woman on the Sabbath day . This made the synagogue ruler angry . He told the people , " There are six days for work . So come and be healed on those days . But do not come on the Sabbath . "
42013015	The Lord answered him , " You pretenders ! Doesn't each of you go to the barn and untie his ox or donkey on the Sabbath day ? Then don't you lead it out to give it water ?
42013016	This woman is a member of Abraham's family line . But Satan has kept her disabled for 18 long years . Shouldn't she be set free on the Sabbath day from what was keeping her disabled ? "
42013017	When Jesus said this , all those who opposed him were put to shame . But the people were delighted . They loved all the wonderful things he was doing .
42013018	Then Jesus asked , " What is God's kingdom like ? What can I compare it to ?
42013019	It is like a mustard seed . Someone took the seed and planted it in a garden . It grew and became a tree . The birds sat in its branches . "
42013020	Again he asked , " What can I compare God's kingdom to ?
42013021	It is like yeast that a woman used . She mixed it into a large amount of flour . The yeast worked its way all through the dough . "
42013022	Then Jesus went through the towns and villages , teaching the people . He was on his way to Jerusalem .
42013023	Someone asked him , " Lord , are only a few people going to be saved ? " He said to them ,
42013024	" Try very hard to enter through the narrow door . I tell you , many will try to enter and will not be able to .
42013025	The owner of the house will get up and close the door . Then you will stand outside knocking and begging . You will say , ' Sir , open the door for us . ' " But he will answer , ' I don't know you . And I don't know where you come from . '
42013026	" Then you will say , ' We ate and drank with you . You taught in our streets . '
42013027	" But he will reply , ' I don't know you . And I don't know where you come from . Get away from me , all you who do evil ! '
42013028	" You will sob and grind your teeth when you see those who are in God's kingdom . You will see Abraham , Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets there . But you yourselves will be thrown out .
42013029	People will come from east and west and north and south . They will take their places at the feast in God's kingdom .
42013030	Then the last will be first . And the first will be last . "
42013031	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus . They said to him , " Leave this place . Go somewhere else . Herod wants to kill you . "
42013032	He replied , " Go and tell that fox , ' I will drive out demons . I will heal people today and tomorrow . And on the third day I will reach my goal . '
42013033	In any case , I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day . Certainly no prophet can die outside Jerusalem !
42013034	" Jerusalem ! Jerusalem ! You kill the prophets and throw stones in order to kill those who are sent to you . Many times I have wanted to gather your people together . I have wanted to be like a hen who gathers her chicks under her wings . But you would not let me !
42013035	" Look , your house is left empty . I tell you , you will not see me again until you say , ' Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord . ' "
42014001	One Sabbath day , Jesus went to eat in the house of a well-known Pharisee . While he was there , he was being carefully watched .
42014002	In front of him was a man whose body was badly swollen .
42014003	Jesus turned to the Pharisees and the authorities on the law . He asked them , " Is it breaking the Law to heal on the Sabbath ? "
42014004	But they remained silent . So Jesus took hold of the man and healed him . Then he sent him away .
42014005	He asked them another question . He said , " Suppose one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day . Wouldn't you pull him out right away ? "
42014006	And they had nothing to say .
42014007	Jesus noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table . So he told them a story .
42014008	He said , " Suppose someone invites you to a wedding feast . Do not take the place of honor . A person more important than you may have been invited .
42014009	If so , the host who invited both of you will come to you . He will say , ' Give this person your seat . ' Then you will be filled with shame . You will have to take the least important place .
42014010	" But when you are invited , take the lowest place . Then your host will come over to you . He will say , ' Friend , move up to a better place . ' Then you will be honored in front of all the other guests .
42014011	Anyone who lifts himself up will be brought down . And anyone who is brought down will be lifted up . "
42014012	Then Jesus spoke to his host . " Suppose you give a lunch or a dinner , " he said . " Do not invite your friends , your brothers or sisters , or your relatives , or your rich neighbors . If you do , they may invite you to eat with them . So you will be paid back .
42014013	" But when you give a big dinner , invite those who are poor . Also invite those who can't walk , the disabled and the blind .
42014014	Then you will be blessed . Your guests can't pay you back . But you will be paid back when those who are right with God rise from the dead . "
42014015	One of the people at the table with Jesus heard him say those things . So he said to Jesus , " Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in God's kingdom . "
42014016	Jesus replied , " A certain man was preparing a big dinner . He invited many guests .
42014017	Then the day of the dinner arrived . He sent his servant to those who had been invited . The servant told them , ' Come . Everything is ready now . '
42014018	" But they all had the same idea . They began to make excuses . The first one said , ' I have just bought a field . I have to go and see it . Please excuse me . '
42014019	" Another said , ' I have just bought five pairs of oxen . I'm on my way to try them out . Please excuse me . '
42014020	" Still another said , ' I just got married , so I can't come . '
42014021	" The servant came back and reported this to his master . " Then the owner of the house became angry . He ordered his servant , ' Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the town . Bring in those who are poor . Also bring those who can't walk , the blind and the disabled . '
42014022	" ' Sir , ' the servant said , ' what you ordered has been done . But there is still room . '
42014023	" Then the master told his servant , ' Go out to the roads . Go out to the country lanes . Make the people come in . I want my house to be full .
42014024	I tell you , not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my dinner . ' "
42014025	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus . He turned and spoke to them . He said ,
42014026	" Anyone who comes to me must hate his father and mother . He must hate his wife and children . He must hate his brothers and sisters . And he must hate even his own life . Unless he does , he can't be my disciple .
42014027	Anyone who doesn't carry his cross and follow me can't be my disciple .
42014028	" Suppose someone wants to build a tower . Won't he sit down first and figure out how much it will cost ? Then he will see whether he has enough money to finish it .
42014029	Suppose he starts building and is not able to finish . Then everyone who sees what he has done will laugh at him .
42014030	They will say , ' This fellow started to build . But he wasn't able to finish . '
42014031	" Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king . And suppose he has 10,000 men , while the other has 20,000 coming against him . Won't he first sit down and think about whether he can win ?
42014032	" And suppose he decides he can't win . Then he will send some men to ask how peace can be made . He will do this while the other king is still far away .
42014033	" In the same way , you must give up everything you have . If you don't , you can't be my disciple .
42014034	" Salt is good . But suppose it loses its saltiness . How can it be made salty again ?
42014035	It is not good for the soil . And it is not good for the trash pile . It will be thrown out . " Those who have ears should listen . "
42015001	The tax collectors and " sinners " were all gathering around to hear Jesus .
42015002	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were whispering among themselves . They said , " This man welcomes sinners and eats with them . "
42015003	Then Jesus told them a story .
42015004	He said , " Suppose one of you has 100 sheep and loses one of them . Won't he leave the 99 in the open country ? Won't he go and look for the one lost sheep until he finds it ?
42015005	When he finds it , he will joyfully put it on his shoulders
42015006	and go home . Then he will call his friends and neighbors together . He will say , ' Be joyful with me . I have found my lost sheep . '
42015007	" I tell you , it will be the same in heaven . There will be great joy when one sinner turns away from sin . Yes , there will be more joy than for 99 godly people who do not need to turn away from their sins .
42015008	" Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one . She will light a lamp and sweep the house . She will search carefully until she finds the coin .
42015009	And when she finds it , she will call her friends and neighbors together . She will say , ' Be joyful with me . I have found my lost coin . '
42015010	" I tell you , it is the same in heaven . There is joy in heaven over one sinner who turns away from sin . "
42015011	Jesus continued , " There was a man who had two sons .
42015012	The younger son spoke to his father . He said , ' Father , give me my share of the family property . ' So the father divided his property between his two sons .
42015013	" Not long after that , the younger son packed up all he had . Then he left for a country far away . There he wasted his money on wild living .
42015014	He spent everything he had . " Then the whole country ran low on food . So the son didn't have what he needed .
42015015	He went to work for someone who lived in that country , who sent him to the fields to feed the pigs .
42015016	The son wanted to fill his stomach with the food the pigs were eating . But no one gave him anything .
42015017	" Then he began to think clearly again . He said , ' How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food ! But here I am dying from hunger !
42015018	I will get up and go back to my father . I will say to him , " Father , I have sinned against heaven . And I have sinned against you .
42015019	I am no longer fit to be called your son . Make me like one of your hired workers . " '
42015020	So he got up and went to his father . " While the son was still a long way off , his father saw him . He was filled with tender love for his son . He ran to him . He threw his arms around him and kissed him .
42015021	" The son said to him , ' Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you . I am no longer fit to be called your son . '
42015022	" But the father said to his servants , ' Quick ! Bring the best robe and put it on him . Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet .
42015023	Bring the fattest calf and kill it . Let's have a big dinner and celebrate .
42015024	This son of mine was dead . And now he is alive again . He was lost . And now he is found . ' " So they began to celebrate .
42015025	" The older son was in the field . When he came near the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	So he called one of the servants . He asked him what was going on .
42015027	" ' Your brother has come home , ' the servant replied . ' Your father has killed the fattest calf . He has done this because your brother is back safe and sound . '
42015028	" The older brother became angry . He refused to go in . So his father went out and begged him .
42015029	" But he answered his father , ' Look ! All these years I've worked like a slave for you . I have always obeyed your orders . You never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends .
42015030	But this son of yours wasted your money with some prostitutes . Now he comes home . And for him you kill the fattest calf ! '
42015031	" ' My son , ' the father said , ' you are always with me . Everything I have is yours .
42015032	But we had to celebrate and be glad . This brother of yours was dead . And now he is alive again . He was lost . And now he is found . ' "
42016001	Jesus told his disciples another story . He said , " There was a rich man who had a manager . Some said that the manager was wasting what the rich man owned .
42016002	So the rich man told him to come in . He asked him , ' What is this I hear about you ? Tell me exactly how you have handled what I own . You can't be my manager any longer . '
42016003	" The manager said to himself , ' What will I do now ? My master is taking away my job . I'm not strong enough to dig . And I'm too ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what I'm going to do . I'll do something so that when I lose my job here , people will welcome me into their houses . '
42016005	" So he called in each person who owed his master something . He asked the first one , ' How much do you owe my master ? '
42016006	" ' I owe 800 gallons of olive oil , ' he replied . " The manager told him , ' Take your bill . Sit down quickly and change it to 400 gallons . '
42016007	" Then he asked the second one , ' And how much do you owe ? ' " ' I owe 1,000 bushels of wheat , ' he replied . " The manager told him , ' Take your bill and change it to 800 bushels . '
42016008	" The manager had not been honest . But the master praised him for being clever . The people of this world are clever in dealing with those who are like themselves . They are more clever than God's people .
42016009	" I tell you , use the riches of this world to help others . In that way , you will make friends for yourselves . Then when your riches are gone , you will be welcomed into your eternal home in heaven .
42016010	" Suppose you can be trusted with very little . Then you can be trusted with a lot . But suppose you are not honest with very little . Then you will not be honest with a lot .
42016011	" Suppose you have not been worthy of trust in handling worldly wealth . Then who will trust you with true riches ?
42016012	Suppose you have not been worthy of trust in handling someone else's property . Then who will give you property of your own ?
42016013	" No servant can serve two masters at the same time . He will hate one of them and love the other . Or he will be faithful to one and dislike the other . You can't serve God and Money at the same time . "
42016014	The Pharisees loved money . They heard all that Jesus said and made fun of him .
42016015	Jesus said to them , " You try to make yourselves look good in the eyes of other people . But God knows your hearts . What is worth a great deal among people is hated by God .
42016016	" The teachings of the Law and the Prophets were preached until John came . Since then , the good news of God's kingdom is being preached . And everyone is trying very hard to enter it .
42016017	It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest part of a letter to drop out of the Law .
42016018	" Anyone who divorces his wife and gets married to another woman commits adultery . Also , the man who gets married to a divorced woman commits adultery .
42016019	" Once there was a rich man . He was dressed in purple cloth and fine linen . He lived an easy life every day .
42016020	A man named Lazarus was placed at his gate . Lazarus was a beggar . His body was covered with sores .
42016021	Even dogs came and licked his sores . All he wanted was to eat what fell from the rich man's table .
42016022	" The time came when the beggar died . The angels carried him to Abraham's side . The rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	In hell , the rich man was suffering terribly . He looked up and saw Abraham far away . Lazarus was by his side .
42016024	So the rich man called out , ' Father Abraham ! Have pity on me ! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water . Then he can cool my tongue with it . I am in terrible pain in this fire . '
42016025	" But Abraham replied , ' Son , remember what happened in your lifetime . You received your good things . Lazarus received bad things . Now he is comforted here , and you are in terrible pain .
42016026	Besides , a wide space has been placed between us and you . So those who want to go from here to you can't go . And no one can cross over from there to us . '
42016027	" The rich man answered , ' Then I beg you , father . Send Lazarus to my family .
42016028	I have five brothers . Let Lazarus warn them . Then they will not come to this place of terrible suffering . '
42016029	" Abraham replied , ' They have the teachings of Moses and the Prophets . Let your brothers listen to them . '
42016030	" ' No , father Abraham , ' he said . ' But if someone from the dead goes to them , they will turn away from their sins . '
42016031	" Abraham said to him , ' They do not listen to Moses and the Prophets . So they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead . ' "
42017001	Jesus spoke to his disciples . " Things that make people sin are sure to come , " he said . " But how terrible it will be for the person who brings them !
42017002	Suppose people lead one of these little ones to sin . It would be better for those people to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck .
42017003	So watch what you do . " If your brother sins , tell him he is wrong . Then if he turns away from his sins , forgive him .
42017004	Suppose he sins against you seven times in one day . And suppose he comes back to you each time and says , ' I'm sorry . ' Forgive him . "
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , " Give us more faith ! "
42017006	He replied , " Suppose you have faith as small as a mustard seed . Then you can say to this mulberry tree , ' Be pulled up . Be planted in the sea . ' And it will obey you .
42017007	" Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep . And suppose the servant came in from the field . Would you say to him , ' Come along now and sit down to eat ' ?
42017008	No . Instead , you would say , ' Prepare my supper . Get yourself ready . Wait on me while I eat and drink . Then after that you can eat and drink . '
42017009	Would you thank the servant because he did what he was told to do ?
42017010	" It's the same with you . Suppose you have done everything you were told to do . Then you should say , ' We are not worthy to serve you . We have only done our duty . ' "
42017011	Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem . He traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he was going into a village , ten men met him . They had a skin disease . They were standing close by .
42017013	And they called out in a loud voice , " Jesus ! Master ! Have pity on us ! "
42017014	Jesus saw them and said , " Go . Show yourselves to the priests . " While they were on the way , they were healed .
42017015	When one of them saw that he was healed , he came back . He praised God in a loud voice .
42017016	He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him . The man was a Samaritan .
42017017	Jesus asked , " Weren't all ten healed ? Where are the other nine ?
42017018	Didn't anyone else return and give praise to God except this outsider ? "
42017019	Then Jesus said to him , " Get up and go . Your faith has healed you . "
42017020	Once the Pharisees asked Jesus when God's kingdom would come . He replied , " The coming of God's kingdom is not something you can see just by watching for it carefully .
42017021	People will not say , ' Here it is . ' Or , ' There it is . ' God's kingdom is among you . "
42017022	Then Jesus spoke to his disciples . " The time is coming , " he said , " when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man . But you won't see it .
42017023	People will tell you , ' There he is ! ' Or , ' Here he is ! ' Don't go running off after them .
42017024	" When the Son of Man comes , he will be like the lightning . It flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other .
42017025	But first the Son of Man must suffer many things . He will not be accepted by the people of today .
42017026	" Remember how it was in the days of Noah . It will be the same when the Son of Man comes .
42017027	People were eating and drinking . They were getting married . They were giving their daughters to be married . They did all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark . Then the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	" It was the same in the days of Lot . People were eating and drinking . They were buying and selling . They were planting and building .
42017029	But on the day Lot left Sodom , fire and sulfur rained down from heaven . And all the people were destroyed .
42017030	" It will be just like that on the day the Son of Man is shown to the world .
42017031	Suppose someone is on the roof of his house on that day . And suppose his goods are inside the house . He should not go down to get them . No one in the field should go back for anything either .
42017032	Remember Lot's wife !
42017033	Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it . Anyone who loses his life will keep it .
42017034	" I tell you , on that night two people will be in one bed . One person will be taken and the other left .
42017037	" Where , Lord ? " his disciples asked . He replied , " The vultures will gather where there is a dead body . "
42018001	Jesus told his disciples a story . He wanted to show them that they should always pray and not give up .
42018002	He said , " In a certain town there was a judge . He didn't have any respect for God or care about people .
42018003	A widow lived in that town . She came to the judge again and again . She kept begging him , ' Make things right for me . Someone is doing me wrong . '
42018004	" For some time the judge refused . But finally he said to himself , ' I don't have any respect for God . I don't care about people .
42018005	But this widow keeps bothering me . So I will see that things are made right for her . If I don't , she will wear me out by coming again and again ! ' "
42018006	The Lord said , " Listen to what the unfair judge says .
42018007	" God's chosen people cry out to him day and night . Won't he make things right for them ? Will he keep putting them off ?
42018008	I tell you , God will see that things are made right for them . He will make sure it happens quickly . " But when the Son of Man comes , will he find people on earth who have faith ? "
42018009	Jesus told a story to some people who were sure they were right with God . They looked down on everybody else .
42018010	He said to them , " Two men went up to the temple to pray . One was a Pharisee . The other was a tax collector .
42018011	" The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself . ' God , I thank you that I am not like other people , ' he said . ' I am not like robbers or those who do other evil things . I am not like those who commit adultery . I am not even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week . And I give a tenth of all I get . '
42018013	" But the tax collector stood not very far away . He would not even look up to heaven . He beat his chest and said , ' God , have mercy on me . I am a sinner . '
42018014	" I tell you , the tax collector went home accepted by God . But not the Pharisee . Everyone who lifts himself up will be brought down . And anyone who is brought down will be lifted up . "
42018015	People were also bringing babies to Jesus . They wanted him to touch them . When the disciples saw this , they told the people to stop .
42018016	But Jesus asked the children to come to him . " Let the little children come to me , " he said . " Don't keep them away . God's kingdom belongs to people like them .
42018017	What I'm about to tell you is true . Anyone who will not receive God's kingdom like a little child will never enter it . "
42018018	A certain ruler asked Jesus a question . " Good teacher , " he said , " what must I do to receive eternal life ? "
42018019	" Why do you call me good ? " Jesus answered . " No one is good except God .
42018020	You know what the commandments say . ' Do not commit adultery . Do not commit murder . Do not steal . Do not give false witness . Honor your father and mother . ' "
42018021	" I have obeyed all those commandments since I was a boy , " the ruler said .
42018022	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , " You are still missing one thing . Sell everything you have . Give the money to those who are poor . You will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me . "
42018023	When the ruler heard this , he became very sad . He was very rich .
42018024	Jesus looked at him . Then he said , " How hard it is for rich people to enter God's kingdom !
42018025	Is it hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle ? It is even harder for the rich to enter God's kingdom ! "
42018026	Those who heard this asked , " Then who can be saved ? "
42018027	Jesus replied , " Things that are impossible with people are possible with God . "
42018028	Peter said to him , " We have left everything we had in order to follow you ! "
42018029	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " Jesus said to them . " Has anyone left home or family for God's kingdom ?
42018030	They will receive many times as much in this world . In the world to come they will live forever . "
42018031	Jesus took the Twelve to one side . He told them , " We are going up to Jerusalem . Everything that the prophets wrote about the Son of Man will come true .
42018032	He will be handed over to people who are not Jews . They will make fun of him . They will laugh at him and spit on him . They will whip him and kill him .
42018033	On the third day , he will rise from the dead ! "
42018034	The disciples did not understand any of this . Its meaning was hidden from them . So they didn't know what Jesus was talking about .
42018035	Jesus was approaching Jericho . A blind man was sitting by the side of the road begging .
42018036	The blind man heard the crowd going by . He asked what was happening .
42018037	They told him , " Jesus of Nazareth is passing by . "
42018038	So the blind man called out , " Jesus ! Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! "
42018039	Those who led the way commanded him to stop . They told him to be quiet . But he shouted even louder , " Son of David ! Have mercy on me ! "
42018040	Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him . When the man came near , Jesus spoke to him .
42018041	" What do you want me to do for you ? " Jesus asked . " Lord , I want to be able to see , " the blind man replied .
42018042	Jesus said to him , " Receive your sight . Your faith has healed you . "
42018043	Right away he could see . He followed Jesus , praising God . When all the people saw it , they also praised God .
42019001	Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through .
42019002	A man named Zacchaeus lived there . He was a chief tax collector and was very rich .
42019003	Zacchaeus wanted to see who Jesus was . But he was a short man . He could not see Jesus because of the crowd .
42019004	So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree . He wanted to see Jesus , who was coming that way .
42019005	Jesus reached the spot where Zacchaeus was . He looked up and said , " Zacchaeus , come down at once . I must stay at your house today . "
42019006	So Zacchaeus came down at once and welcomed him gladly .
42019007	All the people saw this . They began to whisper among themselves . They said , " Jesus has gone to be the guest of a ' sinner . ' "
42019008	But Zacchaeus stood up . He said , " Look , Lord ! Here and now I give half of what I own to those who are poor . And if I have cheated anybody out of anything , I will pay it back . I will pay back four times the amount I took . "
42019009	Jesus said to Zacchaeus , " Today salvation has come to your house . You are a member of Abraham's family line .
42019010	The Son of Man came to look for the lost and save them . "
42019011	While the people were listening to these things , Jesus told them a story . He was near Jerusalem . The people thought that God's kingdom was going to appear right away .
42019012	Jesus said , " A man from an important family went to a country far away . He went there to be made king and then return home .
42019013	So he sent for ten of his servants . He gave them each about three months' pay . ' Put this money to work until I come back , ' he said .
42019014	" But those he ruled over hated him . They sent some messengers after him . They were sent to say , ' We don't want this man to be our king . '
42019015	" But he was made king and returned home . Then he sent for the servants he had given the money to . He wanted to find out what they had earned with it .
42019016	" The first one came to him . He said , ' Sir , your money has earned ten times as much . '
42019017	" ' You have done well , my good servant ! ' his master replied . ' You have been faithful in a very small matter . So I will put you in charge of ten towns . '
42019018	" The second servant came to his master . He said , ' Sir , your money has earned five times as much . '
42019019	" His master answered , ' I will put you in charge of five towns . '
42019020	" Then another servant came . He said , ' Sir , here is your money . I have kept it hidden in a piece of cloth .
42019021	I was afraid of you . You are a hard man . You take out what you did not put in . You harvest what you did not plant . '
42019022	" His master replied , ' I will judge you by your own words , you evil servant ! So you knew that I am a hard man ? You knew that I take out what I did not put in ? You knew that I harvest what I did not plant ?
42019023	Then why didn't you put my money in the bank ? When I came back , I could have collected it with interest . '
42019024	" Then he said to those standing by , ' Take his money away from him . Give it to the one who has ten times as much . '
42019025	" ' Sir , ' they said , ' he already has ten times as much ! '
42019026	" He replied , ' I tell you that everyone who has will be given more . But here is what will happen to anyone who has nothing . Even what he has will be taken away from him .
42019027	And what about my enemies who did not want me to be king over them ? Bring them here ! Kill them in front of me ! ' "
42019028	After Jesus had said this , he went on ahead . He was going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	He approached Bethphage and Bethany . The hill there was called the Mount of Olives . Jesus sent out two of his disciples . He said to them ,
42019030	" Go to the village ahead of you . As soon as you get there , you will find a donkey's colt tied up . No one has ever ridden it . Untie it and bring it here .
42019031	Someone may ask you , ' Why are you untying it ? ' If so , say , ' The Lord needs it . ' "
42019032	Those who were sent ahead went and found the young donkey . It was there just as Jesus had told them .
42019033	They were untying the colt when its owners came . The owners asked them , " Why are you untying the colt ? "
42019034	They replied , " The Lord needs it . "
42019035	Then the disciples brought the colt to Jesus . They threw their coats on the young donkey and put Jesus on it .
42019036	As he went along , people spread their coats on the road .
42019037	Jesus came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives . There the whole crowd of disciples began to praise God with joy . In loud voices they praised him for all the miracles they had seen . They shouted ,
42019038	" Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! " " May there be peace and glory in the highest heaven ! "
42019039	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd spoke to Jesus . " Teacher , " they said , " tell your disciples to stop ! "
42019040	" I tell you , " he replied , " if they keep quiet , the stones will cry out . "
42019041	He approached Jerusalem . When he saw the city , he began to sob .
42019042	He said , " I wish you had known today what would bring you peace ! But now it is hidden from your eyes .
42019043	" The days will come when your enemies will arrive . They will build a wall of dirt up against your city . They will surround you and close you in on every side .
42019044	You didn't recognize the time when God came to you . So your enemies will smash you to the ground . They will destroy you and all the people inside your walls . They will not leave one stone on top of another . "
42019045	Then Jesus entered the temple area . He began chasing out those who were selling there .
42019046	He told them , " It is written that the Lord said , ' My house will be a house where people can pray . ' But you have made it a ' den for robbers . ' "
42019047	Every day Jesus was teaching at the temple . But the chief priests and the teachers of the law were trying to kill him . So were the leaders among the people .
42019048	But they couldn't find any way to do it . All the people were paying close attention to his words .
42020001	One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courtyard . He was preaching the good news to them . The chief priests and the teachers of the law came up to him . The elders came with them .
42020002	" Tell us by what authority you are doing these things , " they all said . " Who gave you this authority ? "
42020003	Jesus replied , " I will also ask you a question . Tell me ,
42020004	was John's baptism from heaven ? Or did it come from men ? "
42020005	They talked to each other about it . They said , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask , ' Why didn't you believe him ? '
42020006	But if we say , ' From men , ' all the people will throw stones at us and kill us . They believe that John was a prophet . "
42020007	So they answered Jesus , " We don't know where John's baptism came from . "
42020008	Jesus said , " Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things either . "
42020009	Jesus went on to tell the people a story . " A man planted a vineyard , " he said . " He rented it out to some farmers . Then he went away for a long time .
42020010	" At harvest time he sent a servant to the renters . They were supposed to give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the renters beat the servant . Then they sent him away with nothing .
42020011	So the man sent another servant . They beat that one and treated him badly . They also sent him away with nothing .
42020012	The man sent a third servant . The renters wounded him and threw him out .
42020013	" Then the owner of the vineyard said , ' What should I do ? I have a son , and I love him . I will send him . Maybe they will respect him . '
42020014	" But when the renters saw the son , they talked the matter over . ' This is the one who will receive all the owner's property someday , ' they said . ' Let's kill him . Then everything will be ours . '
42020015	So they threw him out of the vineyard . And they killed him . " What will the owner of the vineyard do to the renters ?
42020016	He will come and kill them . He will give the vineyard to others . " When the people heard this , they said , " We hope this never happens ! "
42020017	Jesus looked right at them and said , " Here is something I want you to explain the meaning of . It is written , " ' The stone the builders didn't accept has become the most important stone of all . '
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces . But the stone will crush anyone it falls on . "
42020019	The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest Jesus at once . They knew he had told that story against them . But they were afraid of the people .
42020020	The religious leaders sent spies to keep a close watch on Jesus . The spies pretended to be honest . They hoped they could trap Jesus with something he would say . Then they could hand him over to the power and authority of the governor .
42020021	So the spies questioned Jesus . " Teacher , " they said , " we know that you speak and teach what is right . We know you don't favor one person over another . You teach the way of God truthfully .
42020022	Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? "
42020023	Jesus saw they were trying to trick him . So he said to them ,
42020024	" Show me a silver coin . Whose picture and words are on it ? "
42020025	" Caesar's , " they replied . He said to them , " Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar . And give to God what belongs to God . "
42020026	They were not able to trap him with what he had said there in front of all the people . Amazed by his answer , they became silent .
42020027	The Sadducees do not believe that people rise from the dead . Some of them came to Jesus with a question .
42020028	" Teacher , " they said , " Moses wrote for us about a man's brother who dies . Suppose the brother leaves a wife but has no children . Then the man must get married to the widow . He must have children to carry on his dead brother's name .
42020029	" There were seven brothers . The first one got married to a woman . He died without leaving any children .
42020030	The second one got married to her .
42020031	And then the third one got married to her . One after another , the seven brothers got married to her . They all died . None left any children .
42020032	Finally , the woman died too .
42020033	Now then , when the dead rise , whose wife will she be ? All seven brothers were married to her . "
42020034	Jesus replied , " People in this world get married . And their parents give them to get married .
42020035	But it will not be like that when the dead rise . Those who are considered worthy to take part in what happens at that time won't get married . And their parents won't give them to be married .
42020036	They can't die anymore . They are like the angels . They are God's children . They will be given a new form of life when the dead rise .
42020037	" Remember the story of Moses and the bush . Even Moses showed that the dead rise . The Lord said to him , ' I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob . '
42020038	He is not the God of the dead . He is the God of the living . In his eyes , everyone is alive . "
42020039	Some of the teachers of the law replied , " You have spoken well , teacher ! "
42020040	And no one dared to ask him any more questions .
42020041	Jesus said to them , " Why do people say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
42020042	David himself says in the Book of Psalms , " ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand
42020043	until I put your enemies under your control . " '
42020044	David calls him ' Lord . ' So how can he be David's son ? "
42020045	All the people were listening . Jesus said to his disciples ,
42020046	" Watch out for the teachers of the law . They like to walk around in long robes . They love to be greeted in the market places . They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues . They also love to have the places of honor at dinners .
42020047	They take over the houses of widows . They say long prayers to show off . God will punish those men very much . "
42021001	As Jesus looked up , he saw rich people putting their gifts into the temple offering boxes .
42021002	He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins .
42021003	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " Jesus said . " That poor widow has put in more than all the others .
42021004	All of those other people gave a lot because they are rich . But even though she is poor , she put in everything . She had nothing left to live on . "
42021005	Some of Jesus' disciples were talking about the temple . They spoke about how it was decorated with beautiful stones and with gifts that honored God . But Jesus asked ,
42021006	" Do you see all this ? The time will come when not one stone will be left on top of another . Every stone will be thrown down . "
42021007	" Teacher , " they asked , " when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place ? "
42021008	Jesus replied , " Keep watch ! Be careful that you are not fooled . Many will come in my name . They will claim , ' I am he ! ' And they will say , ' The time is near ! ' Do not follow them .
42021009	Do not be afraid when you hear about wars and about fighting against rulers . Those things must happen first . But the end will not come right away . "
42021010	Then Jesus said to them , " Nation will fight against nation . Kingdom will fight against kingdom .
42021011	In many places there will be powerful earthquakes . People will go hungry . There will be terrible sicknesses . Things will happen that will make people afraid . There will be great and miraculous signs from heaven .
42021012	" But before all this , people will arrest you and treat you badly . They will hand you over to synagogues and prisons . You will be brought to kings and governors . All this will happen to you because of my name .
42021013	In that way you will be witnesses to them .
42021014	But make up your mind not to worry ahead of time about how to stand up for yourselves .
42021015	I will give you words of wisdom . None of your enemies will be able to withstand them or oppose them .
42021016	" Even your parents , brothers , sisters , relatives and friends will hand you over to the authorities . They will put some of you to death .
42021017	Everyone will hate you because of me .
42021018	But not a hair on your head will be harmed .
42021019	If you stand firm , you will gain life .
42021020	" A time is coming when you will see armies surround Jerusalem . Then you will know that it will soon be destroyed .
42021021	Those who are in Judea should then escape to the mountains . Those in the city should get out . Those in the country should not enter the city .
42021022	This is the time when God will punish Jerusalem . Everything will come true , just as it has been written .
42021023	" How awful it will be in those days for pregnant women ! How awful for nursing mothers ! There will be terrible suffering in the land . There will be great anger against those people .
42021024	Some will be killed by the sword . Others will be taken as prisoners to all the nations . Jerusalem will be overrun by those who aren't Jews until the times of the non-Jews come to an end .
42021025	" There will be miraculous signs in the sun , moon and stars . The nations of the earth will be in terrible pain . They will be puzzled by the roaring and tossing of the sea .
42021026	Terror will make people faint . They will be worried about what is happening in the world . The sun , moon and stars will be shaken from their places .
42021027	" At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud . He will come with power and great glory .
42021028	When these things begin to take place , stand up . Hold your head up with joy and hope . The time when you will be set free will be very close . "
42021029	Jesus told them a story . " Look at the fig tree and all the trees , " he said .
42021030	" When you see leaves appear on the branches , you know that summer is near .
42021031	In the same way , when you see these things happening , you will know that God's kingdom is near .
42021032	" What I'm about to tell you is true . The people living at that time will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away . But my words will never pass away .
42021034	" Be careful . If you aren't , your hearts will be loaded down with wasteful living , drunkenness and the worries of life . Then the day the Son of Man returns will close on you like a trap . You will not be expecting it .
42021035	That day will come upon every person who lives on the whole earth .
42021036	" Always keep watching . Pray that you will be able to escape all that is about to happen . Also , pray that you will not be judged guilty when the Son of Man comes . "
42021037	Each day Jesus taught at the temple . And each evening he went to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives .
42021038	All the people came to the temple early in the morning . They wanted to hear Jesus speak .
42022001	The Feast of Unleavened Bread , called the Passover , was near .
42022002	The chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for a way to get rid of Jesus . They were afraid of the people .
42022003	Then Satan entered Judas , who was called Iscariot . Judas was one of the Twelve .
42022004	He went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard . He talked with them about how he could hand Jesus over to them .
42022005	They were delighted and agreed to give him money .
42022006	Judas accepted their offer . He watched for the right time to hand Jesus over to them . He wanted to do it when no crowd was around .
42022007	Then the day of Unleavened Bread came . That was the time the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
42022008	Jesus sent Peter and John on ahead . " Go , " he told them . " Prepare for us to eat the Passover meal . "
42022009	" Where do you want us to prepare for it ? " they asked .
42022010	Jesus replied , " When you enter the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him to the house he enters .
42022011	Then say to the owner of the house , ' The Teacher asks , " Where is the guest room ? Where can I eat the Passover meal with my disciples ? " '
42022012	He will show you a large upstairs room with furniture in it . Prepare for us to eat there . "
42022013	Peter and John left . They found things just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover meal .
42022014	When the hour came , Jesus and his apostles took their places at the table .
42022015	He said to them , " I have really looked forward to eating this Passover meal with you . I wanted to do this before I suffer .
42022016	I tell you , I will not eat the Passover meal again until it is celebrated in God's kingdom . "
42022017	After Jesus took the cup , he gave thanks . He said , " Take this cup and share it among yourselves .
42022018	I tell you , I will not drink wine with you again until God's kingdom comes . "
42022019	Then Jesus took bread . He gave thanks and broke it . He handed it to them and said , " This is my body . It is given for you . Every time you eat it , do it in memory of me . "
42022020	In the same way , after the supper he took the cup . He said , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood . It is poured out for you .
42022021	But someone here is going to hand me over to my enemies . His hand is with mine on the table .
42022022	The Son of Man will go to his death , just as God has already decided . But how terrible it will be for the one who hands him over ! "
42022023	The apostles began to ask each other about this . They wondered which one of them would do it .
42022024	They also started to argue . They disagreed about which of them was thought to be the most important person .
42022025	Jesus said to them , " The kings of the nations hold power over their people . And those who order them around call themselves Protectors .
42022026	But you must not be like that . Instead , the most important among you should be like the youngest . The one who rules should be like the one who serves .
42022027	" Who is more important ? Is it the one at the table , or the one who serves ? Isn't it the one who is at the table ? But I am among you as one who serves .
42022028	You have stood by me during my troubles .
42022029	And I give you a kingdom , just as my Father gave me a kingdom .
42022030	Then you will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom . And you will sit on thrones , judging the 12 tribes of Israel .
42022031	" Simon , Simon ! Satan has asked to sift you disciples like wheat .
42022032	But I have prayed for you , Simon . I have prayed that your faith will not fail . When you have turned back , help your brothers to be strong . "
42022033	But Simon replied , " Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death . "
42022034	Jesus answered , " I tell you , Peter , you will say three times that you don't know me . And you will do it before the rooster crows today . "
42022035	Then Jesus asked the disciples , " Did you need anything when I sent you without a purse , bag or sandals ? " " Nothing , " they answered .
42022036	He said to them , " But now if you have a purse , take it . And also take a bag . If you don't have a sword , sell your coat and buy one .
42022037	It is written , ' He was counted among those who had committed crimes . ' I tell you that what is written about me must come true . Yes , it is already coming true . "
42022038	The disciples said , " See , Lord , here are two swords . " " That is enough , " he replied .
42022039	Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives . His disciples followed him .
42022040	When they reached the place , Jesus spoke . " Pray that you won't fall into sin when you are tempted , " he said to them .
42022041	Then he went a short distance away from them . There he got down on his knees and prayed .
42022042	He said , " Father , if you are willing , take this cup of suffering away from me . But do what you want , not what I want . "
42022043	An angel from heaven appeared to Jesus and gave him strength .
42022044	Because he was very sad and troubled , he prayed even harder . His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground .
42022045	After that , he got up from prayer and went back to the disciples . He found them sleeping . They were worn out because they were very sad .
42022046	" Why are you sleeping ? " he asked them . " Get up ! Pray that you won't fall into sin when you are tempted . "
42022047	While Jesus was still speaking , a crowd came up . The man named Judas was leading them . He was one of the Twelve . Judas approached Jesus to kiss him .
42022048	But Jesus asked him , " Judas , are you handing over the Son of Man with a kiss ? "
42022049	Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen . So they said , " Lord , should we use our swords against them ? "
42022050	One of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus answered , " Stop this ! " And he touched the man's ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus spoke to the chief priests , the officers of the temple guard , and the elders . They had all come for him . " Am I leading a band of armed men against you ? " he asked . " Do you have to come with swords and clubs ?
42022053	Every day I was with you in the temple courtyard . And you didn't lay a hand on me . But this is your hour . This is when darkness rules . "
42022054	Then the men arrested Jesus and led him away . They took him into the high priest's house . Peter followed from far away .
42022055	They started a fire in the middle of the courtyard . Then they sat down together . Peter sat down with them .
42022056	A female servant saw him sitting there in the firelight . She looked closely at him . Then she said , " This man was with Jesus . "
42022057	But Peter said he had not been with him . " Woman , I don't know him , " he said .
42022058	A little later someone else saw Peter . " You also are one of them , " he said . " No , " Peter replied . " I'm not ! "
42022059	About an hour later , another person spoke up . " This fellow must have been with Jesus , " he said . " He is from Galilee . "
42022060	Peter replied , " Man , I don't know what you're talking about ! " Just as he was speaking , the rooster crowed .
42022061	The Lord turned and looked right at Peter . Then Peter remembered what the Lord had spoken to him . " The rooster will crow today , " Jesus had said . " Before it does , you will say three times that you don't know me . "
42022062	Peter went outside . He broke down and sobbed .
42022063	There were men guarding Jesus . They began laughing at him and beating him .
42022064	They blindfolded him . They said , " Prophesy ! Who hit you ? "
42022065	They also said many other things to make fun of him .
42022066	At dawn the elders of the people met together . These included the chief priests and the teachers of the law . Jesus was led to them .
42022067	" If you are the Christ , " they said , " tell us . " Jesus answered , " If I tell you , you will not believe me .
42022068	And if I asked you , you would not answer .
42022069	But from now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God . "
42022070	They all asked , " Are you the Son of God then ? " He replied , " You are right in saying that I am . "
42022071	Then they said , " Why do we need any more witnesses ? We have heard it from his own lips . "
42023001	Then the whole group got up and led Jesus off to Pilate .
42023002	They began to bring charges against Jesus . They said , " We have found this man misleading our people . He is against paying taxes to Caesar . And he claims to be Christ , a king . "
42023003	So Pilate asked Jesus , " Are you the king of the Jews ? " " Yes . It is just as you say , " Jesus replied .
42023004	Then Pilate spoke to the chief priests and the crowd . He announced , " I find no basis for a charge against this man . "
42023005	But they kept it up . They said , " His teaching stirs up the people all over Judea . He started in Galilee and has come all the way here . "
42023006	When Pilate heard this , he asked if the man was from Galilee .
42023007	He learned that Jesus was from Herod's area of authority . So Pilate sent Jesus to Herod . At that time Herod was also in Jerusalem .
42023008	When Herod saw Jesus , he was very pleased . He had been wanting to see Jesus for a long time . He had heard much about him . He hoped to see Jesus do a miracle .
42023009	Herod asked him many questions , but Jesus gave him no answer .
42023010	The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there . With loud shouts they brought charges against him .
42023011	Herod and his soldiers laughed at him and made fun of him . They dressed him in a beautiful robe . Then they sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	That day Herod and Pilate became friends . Before this time they had been enemies .
42023013	Pilate called together the chief priests , the rulers and the people .
42023014	He said to them , " You brought me this man . You said he was turning the people against the authorities . I have questioned him in front of you . I have found no basis for your charges against him .
42023015	Herod hasn't either . So he sent Jesus back to us . As you can see , Jesus has done nothing that is worthy of death .
42023018	With one voice the crowd cried out , " Kill this man ! Give Barabbas to us ! "
42023019	Barabbas had been thrown into prison . He had taken part in a struggle in the city against the authorities . He had also committed murder .
42023020	Pilate wanted to let Jesus go . So he made an appeal to the crowd again .
42023021	But they kept shouting , " Crucify him ! Crucify him ! "
42023022	Pilate spoke to them for the third time . " Why ? " he asked . " What wrong has this man done ? I have found no reason to have him put to death . So I will just have him whipped and let him go . "
42023023	But with loud shouts they kept calling for Jesus to be crucified . The people's shouts won out .
42023024	So Pilate decided to give them what they wanted .
42023025	He set free the man they asked for . The man had been thrown in prison for murder and for fighting against the authorities . Pilate gave Jesus over to them so they could carry out their plans .
42023026	As they led Jesus away , they took hold of Simon . Simon was from Cyrene . He was on his way in from the country . They put a wooden cross on his shoulders . Then they made him carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	A large number of people followed Jesus . Some were women whose hearts were filled with sorrow . They cried loudly because of him .
42023028	Jesus turned and said to them , " Daughters of Jerusalem , do not cry for me . Cry for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	The time will come when you will say , ' Blessed are the women who can't have children ! Blessed are those who never gave birth or nursed babies ! '
42023030	It is written , " ' The people will say to the mountains , " Fall on us ! " They'll say to the hills , " Cover us ! " '
42023031	People do these things when trees are green . So what will happen when trees are dry ? "
42023032	Two other men were also led out with Jesus to be killed . Both of them had broken the law .
42023033	The soldiers brought them to the place called The Skull . There they nailed Jesus to the cross . He hung between the two criminals . One was on his right and one was on his left .
42023034	Jesus said , " Father , forgive them . They don't know what they are doing . " The soldiers divided up his clothes by casting lots .
42023035	The people stood there watching . The rulers even made fun of Jesus . They said , " He saved others . Let him save himself if he is the Christ of God , the Chosen One . "
42023036	The soldiers also came up and poked fun at him . They offered him wine vinegar .
42023037	They said , " If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself . "
42023038	A written sign had been placed above him . It read , this is the king of the jews .
42023039	One of the criminals hanging there made fun of Jesus . He said , " Aren't you the Christ ? Save yourself ! Save us ! "
42023040	But the other criminal scolded him . " Don't you have any respect for God ? " he said . " Remember , you are under the same sentence of death .
42023041	We are being punished fairly . We are getting just what our actions call for . But this man hasn't done anything wrong . "
42023042	Then he said , " Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom . "
42023043	Jesus answered him , " What I'm about to tell you is true . Today you will be with me in paradise . "
42023044	It was now about noon . The whole land was covered with darkness until three o'clock .
42023045	The sun had stopped shining . The temple curtain was torn in two .
42023046	Jesus called out in a loud voice , " Father , into your hands I commit my very life . " After he said this , he took his last breath .
42023047	The Roman commander saw what had happened . He praised God and said , " Jesus was surely a man who did what was right . "
42023048	The people had gathered to watch that sight . When they saw what happened , they beat their chests and went away .
42023049	But all those who knew Jesus stood not very far away , watching those things . They included the women who had followed him from Galilee .
42023050	A man named Joseph was a member of the Jewish Council . He was a good and honest man .
42023051	He had not agreed with what the leaders had decided and done . He was from Arimathea , a town in Judea . He was waiting for God's kingdom .
42023052	Joseph went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body .
42023053	He took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth . Then he put it in a tomb cut in the rock . No one had ever been buried there .
42023054	It was Preparation Day . The Sabbath was about to begin .
42023055	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph . They saw the tomb and how Jesus' body was placed in it .
42023056	Then they went home . There they prepared spices and perfumes . But they rested on the Sabbath day in order to obey the Law .
42024001	It was very early in the morning on the first day of the week . The women took the spices they had prepared . Then they went to the tomb .
42024002	They found the stone rolled away from it .
42024003	When they entered the tomb , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	They were wondering about this . Suddenly two men in clothes as bright as lightning stood beside them .
42024005	The women were terrified . They bowed down with their faces to the ground . Then the men said to them , " Why do you look for the living among the dead ?
42024006	Jesus is not here ! He has risen ! Remember how he told you he would rise . It was while he was still with you in Galilee .
42024007	He said , ' The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people . He must be nailed to a cross . On the third day he will rise from the dead . ' "
42024008	Then the women remembered Jesus' words .
42024009	They came back from the tomb . They told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others .
42024010	Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the others with them were the ones who told the apostles .
42024011	But the apostles did not believe the women . Their words didn't make any sense to them .
42024012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . He bent over and saw the strips of linen lying by themselves . Then he went away , wondering what had happened .
42024013	That same day two of Jesus' followers were going to a village called Emmaus . It was about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	They were talking with each other about everything that had happened .
42024015	As they talked about those things , Jesus himself came up and walked along with them .
42024016	But God kept them from recognizing him .
42024017	Jesus asked them , " What are you talking about as you walk along ? " They stood still , and their faces were sad .
42024018	One of them was named Cleopas . He said to Jesus , " You must be a visitor to Jerusalem . If you lived there , you would know the things that have happened there in the last few days . "
42024019	" What things ? " Jesus asked . " About Jesus of Nazareth , " they replied . " He was a prophet . He was powerful in what he said and did in the eyes of God and all of the people .
42024020	The chief priests and our rulers handed Jesus over to be sentenced to death . They nailed him to a cross .
42024021	But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to set Israel free . Also , it is the third day since all this happened .
42024022	" Some of our women amazed us too . Early this morning they went to the tomb .
42024023	But they didn't find his body . So they came and told us what they had seen . They saw angels , who said Jesus was alive .
42024024	Then some of our friends went to the tomb . They saw it was empty , just as the women had said . They didn't see Jesus' body there . "
42024025	Jesus said to them , " How foolish you are ! How long it takes you to believe all that the prophets said !
42024026	Didn't the Christ have to suffer these things and then receive his glory ? "
42024027	Jesus explained to them what was said about himself in all the Scriptures . He began with Moses and all the Prophets .
42024028	The two men approached the village where they were going . Jesus acted as if he were going farther .
42024029	But they tried hard to keep him from leaving . They said , " Stay with us . It is nearly evening . The day is almost over . " So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	He joined them at the table . Then he took bread and gave thanks . He broke it and began to give it to them .
42024031	Their eyes were opened , and they recognized him . But then he disappeared from their sight .
42024032	They said to each other , " He talked with us on the road . He opened the Scriptures to us . Weren't our hearts burning inside us during that time ? "
42024033	They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem . There they found the Eleven and those with them . They were all gathered together .
42024034	They were saying , " It's true ! The Lord has risen ! He has appeared to Simon ! "
42024035	Then the two of them told what had happened to them on the way . They told how they had recognized Jesus when he broke the bread .
42024036	The disciples were still talking about this when Jesus himself suddenly stood among them . He said , " May peace be with you ! "
42024037	They were surprised and terrified . They thought they were seeing a ghost .
42024038	Jesus said to them , " Why are you troubled ? Why do you have doubts in your minds ?
42024039	Look at my hands and my feet . It is really I ! Touch me and see . A ghost does not have a body or bones . But you can see that I do . "
42024040	After he said that , he showed them his hands and feet .
42024041	But they still did not believe it . They were amazed and filled with joy . So Jesus asked them , " Do you have anything here to eat ? "
42024042	They gave him a piece of cooked fish .
42024043	He took it and ate it in front of them .
42024044	Jesus said to them , " This is what I told you while I was still with you . Everything written about me must happen . Everything written about me in the Law of Moses , the Prophets and the Psalms must come true . "
42024045	Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures .
42024046	He told them , " This is what is written . The Christ will suffer . He will rise from the dead on the third day .
42024047	His followers will preach in his name . They will tell others to turn away from their sins and be forgiven . People from every nation will hear it , beginning at Jerusalem .
42024048	You have seen these things with your own eyes .
42024049	" I am going to send you what my Father has promised . But for now , stay in the city . Stay there until you have received power from heaven . "
42024050	Jesus led his disciples out to the area near Bethany . Then he lifted up his hands and blessed them .
42024051	While he was blessing them , he left them . He was taken up into heaven .
42024052	Then they worshiped him . With great joy , they returned to Jerusalem .
42024053	Every day they went to the temple , praising God .
43001001	In the beginning , the Word was already there . The Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was with God in the beginning .
43001003	All things were made through him . Nothing that has been made was made without him .
43001004	Life was in him , and that life was the light for all people .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness . But the darkness has not understood it .
43001006	A man came who was sent from God . His name was John .
43001007	He came to give witness about that light . He gave witness so that all people could believe .
43001008	John himself was not the light . He came only as a witness to the light .
43001009	The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world .
43001010	The Word was in the world that was made through him . But the world did not recognize him .
43001011	He came to what was his own . But his own people did not accept him .
43001012	Some people did accept him . They believed in his name . He gave them the right to become children of God .
43001013	To be a child of God has nothing to do with human parents . Children of God are not born because of human choice or because a husband wants them to be born . They are born because of what God does .
43001014	The Word became a human being . He made his home with us . We have seen his glory . It is the glory of the one and only Son . He came from the Father . And he was full of grace and truth .
43001015	John gives witness about him . He cries out and says , " This was the one I was talking about . I said , ' He who comes after me is more important than I am . He is more important because he existed before I was born . ' "
43001016	We have all received one blessing after another . God's grace is not limited .
43001017	Moses gave us the law . Jesus Christ has given us grace and truth .
43001018	No one has ever seen God . But God , the one and only Son , is at the Father's side . He has shown us what God is like .
43001019	The Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask John who he was . John gave witness to them .
43001020	He did not try to hide the truth . He spoke to them openly . He said , " I am not the Christ . "
43001021	They asked him , " Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? " He said , " I am not . " " Are you the Prophet we've been expecting ? " they asked . " No , " he answered .
43001022	They asked one last time , " Who are you ? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? "
43001023	John replied , using the words of Isaiah the prophet . John said , " I'm the messenger who is calling out in the desert , ' Make the way for the Lord straight . ' "
43001024	Some Pharisees who had been sent
43001025	asked him , " If you are not the Christ , why are you baptizing people ? Why are you doing that if you aren't Elijah or the Prophet we've been expecting ? "
43001026	" I baptize people with water , " John replied . " But One is standing among you whom you do not know .
43001027	He is the One who comes after me . I am not good enough to untie his sandals . "
43001028	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River . That was where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him . John said , " Look ! The Lamb of God ! He takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is the One I was talking about . I said , ' A man who comes after me is more important than I am . That's because he existed before I was born . '
43001031	I did not know him . But God wants to make it clear to Israel who this person is . That's the reason I came baptizing with water . "
43001032	Then John told them , " I saw the Holy Spirit come down from heaven like a dove . The Spirit remained on Jesus .
43001033	I would not have known him . But the One who sent me to baptize with water told me , ' You will see the Spirit come down and remain on someone . He is the One who will baptize with the Holy Spirit . '
43001034	I have seen it happen . I give witness that this is the Son of God . "
43001035	The next day John was again with two of his disciples .
43001036	He saw Jesus walking by . John said , " Look ! The Lamb of God ! "
43001037	The two disciples heard him say this . So they followed Jesus .
43001038	Then Jesus turned around and saw them following . He asked , " What do you want ? " They said , " Rabbi , where are you staying ? " Rabbi means Teacher .
43001039	" Come , " he replied . " You will see . " So they went and saw where he was staying . They spent the rest of the day with him . It was about four o'clock in the afternoon .
43001040	Andrew was Simon Peter's brother . Andrew was one of the two disciples who heard what John had said . He had also followed Jesus .
43001041	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon . He told him , " We have found the Messiah . " Messiah means Christ .
43001042	And he brought Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , " You are Simon , son of John . You will be called Cephas . "
43001043	The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , " Follow me . "
43001044	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida . So were Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and told him , " We have found the One that Moses wrote about in the Law . The prophets also wrote about him . He is Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . "
43001046	" Nazareth ! Can anything good come from there ? " Nathanael asked . " Come and see , " said Philip .
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael approaching . Here is what Jesus said about him . " He is a true Israelite . There is nothing false in him . "
43001048	" How do you know me ? " Nathanael asked . Jesus answered , " I saw you while you were still under the fig tree . I saw you there before Philip called you . "
43001049	Nathanael replied , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God . You are the King of Israel . "
43001050	Jesus said , " You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree . You will see greater things than that . "
43001051	Then he said to the disciples , " What I'm about to tell you is true . You will see heaven open . You will see the angels of God going up and coming down on the Son of Man . "
43002001	On the third day there was a wedding . It took place at Cana in Galilee . Jesus' mother was there .
43002002	Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding .
43002003	When the wine was gone , Jesus' mother said to him , " They have no more wine . "
43002004	" Dear woman , why do you bring me into this ? " Jesus replied . " My time has not yet come . "
43002005	His mother said to the servants , " Do what he tells you . "
43002006	Six stone water jars stood nearby . The Jews used water from that kind of jar for special washings to make themselves pure . Each jar could hold 20 to 30 gallons .
43002007	Jesus said to the servants , " Fill the jars with water . " So they filled them to the top .
43002008	Then he told them , " Now dip some out . Take it to the person in charge of the dinner . " They did what he said .
43002009	The person in charge tasted the water that had been turned into wine . He didn't realize where it had come from . But the servants who had brought the water knew . Then the person in charge called the groom to one side .
43002010	He said to him , " Everyone brings out the best wine first . They bring out the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink . But you have saved the best until now . "
43002011	That was the first of Jesus' miraculous signs . He did it at Cana in Galilee . Jesus showed his glory by doing it . And his disciples put their faith in him .
43002012	After this , Jesus went down to Capernaum . His mother and brothers and disciples went with him . They all stayed there for a few days .
43002013	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast . So Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	In the temple courtyard he found people who were selling cattle , sheep and doves . Others were sitting at tables exchanging money .
43002015	So Jesus made a whip out of ropes . He chased all the sheep and cattle from the temple area . He scattered the coins of the people exchanging money . And he turned over their tables .
43002016	He told those who were selling doves , " Get these out of here ! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market ! "
43002017	His disciples remembered what had been written . It says , " My great love for your house will destroy me . "
43002018	Then the Jews asked him , " What miraculous sign can you show us ? Can you prove your authority to do all of this ? "
43002019	Jesus answered them , " Destroy this temple . I will raise it up again in three days . "
43002020	The Jews replied , " It has taken 46 years to build this temple . Are you going to raise it up in three days ? "
43002021	But the temple Jesus had spoken about was his body .
43002022	His disciples later remembered what he had said . That was after he had been raised from the dead . Then they believed the Scriptures . They also believed the words that Jesus had spoken .
43002023	Meanwhile , he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast . Many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing . And they believed in his name .
43002024	But Jesus did not fully trust them . He knew what people are like .
43002025	He didn't need others to tell him what people are like . He already knew what was in the human heart .
43003001	There was a Pharisee named Nicodemus . He was one of the Jewish rulers .
43003002	He came to Jesus at night and said , " Rabbi , we know you are a teacher who has come from God . We know that God is with you . If he weren't , you couldn't do the miraculous signs you are doing . "
43003003	Jesus replied , " What I'm about to tell you is true . No one can see God's kingdom without being born again . "
43003004	" How can I be born when I am old ? " Nicodemus asked . " I can't go back inside my mother ! I can't be born a second time ! "
43003005	Jesus answered , " What I'm about to tell you is true . No one can enter God's kingdom without being born through water and the Holy Spirit .
43003006	People give birth to people . But the Spirit gives birth to spirit .
43003007	You should not be surprised when I say , ' You must all be born again . '
43003008	" The wind blows where it wants to . You hear the sound it makes . But you can't tell where it comes from or where it is going . It is the same with everyone who is born through the Spirit . "
43003009	" How can this be ? " Nicodemus asked .
43003010	" You are Israel's teacher , " said Jesus . " Don't you understand these things ?
43003011	" What I'm about to tell you is true . We speak about what we know . We give witness to what we have seen . But still you people do not accept our witness .
43003012	I have spoken to you about earthly things , and you do not believe . So how will you believe if I speak about heavenly things ?
43003013	" No one has ever gone into heaven except the One who came from heaven . He is the Son of Man .
43003014	Moses lifted up the snake in the desert . The Son of Man must be lifted up also .
43003015	Then everyone who believes in him can live with God forever .
43003016	" God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son . Anyone who believes in him will not die but will have eternal life .
43003017	" God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world . He sent his Son to save the world through him .
43003018	Anyone who believes in him is not judged . But anyone who does not believe is judged already . He has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son .
43003019	" Here is the judgment . Light has come into the world , but people loved darkness instead of light . They loved darkness because what they did was evil .
43003020	" Everyone who does evil things hates the light . They will not come into the light . They are afraid that what they do will be seen .
43003021	But anyone who lives by the truth comes into the light . He does this so that it will be easy to see that what he has done is with God's help . "
43003022	After this , Jesus and his disciples went out into the countryside of Judea . There he spent some time with them . And he baptized people there .
43003023	John was also baptizing . He was at Aenon near Salim , where there was plenty of water . People were coming all the time to be baptized .
43003024	That was before John was put in prison .
43003025	Some of John's disciples and a certain Jew began to argue . They argued about special washings to make people " clean . "
43003026	They came to John and said to him , " Rabbi , that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River is baptizing people . He is the one you gave witness about . Everyone is going to him . "
43003027	John replied , " A person can receive only what God gives him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves are witnesses that I said , ' I am not the Christ . I was sent ahead of him . '
43003029	The bride belongs to the groom . The friend who helps the groom waits and listens for him . He is full of joy when he hears the groom's voice . That joy is mine , and it is now complete .
43003030	He must become more important . I must become less important .
43003031	" The One who comes from above is above everything . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks like someone from the earth . The One who comes from heaven is above everything .
43003032	He gives witness to what he has seen and heard . But no one accepts what he says .
43003033	Anyone who has accepted it has said , ' Yes . God is truthful . '
43003034	The One whom God has sent speaks God's words . God gives the Holy Spirit without limit .
43003035	" The Father loves the Son and has put everything into his hands .
43003036	Anyone who believes in the Son has eternal life . Anyone who says no to the Son will not have life . God's anger remains on him . "
43004001	The Pharisees heard that Jesus was winning and baptizing more disciples than John .
43004002	But in fact Jesus was not baptizing . His disciples were .
43004003	When the Lord found out about all this , he left Judea . He went back to Galilee again .
43004004	Jesus had to go through Samaria .
43004005	He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar . It was near the piece of land Jacob had given his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob's well was there . Jesus was tired from the journey . So he sat down by the well . It was about noon .
43004007	A woman from Samaria came to get some water . Jesus said to her , " Will you give me a drink ? "
43004008	His disciples had gone into the town to buy food .
43004009	The Samaritan woman said to him , " You are a Jew . I am a Samaritan woman . How can you ask me for a drink ? " She said this because Jews don't have anything to do with Samaritans .
43004010	Jesus answered her , " You do not know what God's gift is . And you do not know who is asking you for a drink . If you did , you would have asked him . He would have given you living water . "
43004011	" Sir , " the woman said , " you don't have anything to get water with . The well is deep . Where can you get this living water ?
43004012	" Our father Jacob gave us the well . He drank from it himself . So did his sons and his flocks and herds . Are you more important than he is ? "
43004013	Jesus answered , " All who drink this water will be thirsty again .
43004014	But anyone who drinks the water I give him will never be thirsty . In fact , the water I give him will become a spring of water in him . It will flow up into eternal life . "
43004015	The woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water . Then I will never be thirsty . And I won't have to keep coming here to get water . "
43004016	He told her , " Go . Get your husband and come back . "
43004017	" I have no husband , " she replied . Jesus said to her , " You are right when you say you have no husband .
43004018	The fact is , you have had five husbands . And the man you have now is not your husband . What you have just said is very true . "
43004019	" Sir , " the woman said , " I can see that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our people have worshiped on this mountain for a long time . But you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem . "
43004021	Jesus said , " Believe me , woman . A time is coming when you will not worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem .
43004022	You Samaritans worship what you do not know . We worship what we do know . Salvation comes from the Jews .
43004023	" But a new time is coming . In fact , it is already here . True worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth . They are the kind of worshipers the Father is looking for .
43004024	" God is spirit . His worshipers must worship him in spirit and in truth . "
43004025	The woman said , " I know that Messiah is coming . " " When he comes , he will explain everything to us . "
43004026	Then Jesus said , " I , the one speaking to you , am he . "
43004027	Just then Jesus' disciples returned . They were surprised to find him talking with a woman . But no one asked , " What do you want from her ? " No one asked , " Why are you talking with her ? "
43004028	The woman left her water jar and went back to the town . She said to the people ,
43004029	" Come . See a man who told me everything I've ever done . Could this be the Christ ? "
43004030	The people came out of the town and made their way toward Jesus .
43004031	His disciples were saying to him , " Rabbi , eat something ! "
43004032	But he said to them , " I have food to eat that you know nothing about . "
43004033	Then his disciples asked each other , " Did someone bring him food ? "
43004034	Jesus said , " My food is to do what my Father sent me to do . My food is to finish his work .
43004035	" You say , ' Four months more , and then it will be harvest time . ' But I tell you , open your eyes ! Look at the fields ! They are ripe for harvest right now .
43004036	Those who gather the crop are already getting paid . They are already harvesting the crop for eternal life . So those who plant and those who gather can now be glad together .
43004037	" Here is a true saying . ' One plants and another gathers . '
43004038	I sent you to gather what you have not worked for . Others have done the hard work . You have gathered the benefits of their work . "
43004039	Many of the Samaritans from the town of Sychar believed in Jesus . They believed because of the woman's witness . She said , " He told me everything I've ever done . "
43004040	Then the Samaritans came to him and tried to get him to stay with them . So he stayed two days .
43004041	Because of his words , many more people became believers .
43004042	They said to the woman , " We no longer believe just because of what you said . We have now heard for ourselves . We know that this man really is the Savior of the world . "
43004043	After the two days , Jesus left for Galilee .
43004044	He himself had pointed out that a prophet is not respected in his own country .
43004045	When he arrived in Galilee , the people living there welcomed him . They had seen everything he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast . That was because they had also been there .
43004046	Once more , Jesus visited Cana in Galilee . Cana is where he had turned the water into wine . A royal official was there . His son was sick in bed at Capernaum .
43004047	The official heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea . So he went to Jesus and begged him to come and heal his son . The boy was close to death .
43004048	Jesus told him , " You people will never believe unless you see miraculous signs and wonders . "
43004049	The royal official said , " Sir , come down before my child dies . "
43004050	Jesus replied , " You may go . Your son will live . " The man believed what Jesus said , and so he left .
43004051	While he was still on his way home , his servants met him . They gave him the news that his boy was living .
43004052	He asked what time his son got better . They said to him , " The fever left him yesterday afternoon at one o'clock . "
43004053	Then the father realized what had happened . That was the exact time Jesus had said to him , " Your son will live . " So he and all his family became believers .
43004054	This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	Some time later , Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a Jewish feast .
43005002	In Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate is a pool . In the Aramaic language it is called Bethesda . It is surrounded by five rows of columns with a roof over them .
43005005	One person who was there had been disabled for 38 years .
43005006	Jesus saw him lying there . He knew that the man had been in that condition for a long time . So he asked him , " Do you want to get well ? "
43005007	" Sir , " the disabled man replied , " I have no one to help me into the pool when an angel stirs the water up . I try to get in , but someone else always goes down ahead of me . "
43005008	Then Jesus said to him , " Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk . "
43005009	At once the man was healed . He picked up his mat and walked . The day this happened was a Sabbath .
43005010	So the Jews said to the man who had been healed , " It is the Sabbath . The law does not allow you to carry your mat . "
43005011	But he replied , " The one who made me well said to me , ' Pick up your mat and walk . ' "
43005012	They asked him , " Who is this fellow ? Who told you to pick it up and walk ? "
43005013	The one who was healed had no idea who it was . Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there .
43005014	Later Jesus found him at the temple . Jesus said to him , " See , you are well again . Stop sinning , or something worse may happen to you . "
43005015	The man went away . He told the Jews it was Jesus who had made him well .
43005016	Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath day . So the Jews began to oppose him .
43005017	Jesus said to them , " My Father is always doing his work . He is working right up to this very day . I am working too . "
43005018	For this reason the Jews tried even harder to kill him . Jesus was not only breaking the Sabbath . He was even calling God his own Father . He was making himself equal with God .
43005019	Jesus answered , " What I'm about to tell you is true . The Son can do nothing by himself . He can do only what he sees his Father doing . What the Father does , the Son also does .
43005020	This is because the Father loves the Son . He shows him everything he does . Yes , you will be amazed ! The Father will show him even greater things than these .
43005021	" The Father raises the dead and gives them life . In the same way , the Son gives life to anyone he wants to .
43005022	" Also , the Father does not judge anyone . He has given the Son the task of judging .
43005023	Then all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father . Those who do not honor the Son do not honor the Father , who sent him .
43005024	" What I'm about to tell you is true . Anyone who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life . He will not be found guilty . He has crossed over from death to life .
43005025	" What I'm about to tell you is true . A time is coming for me to give life . In fact , it has already begun . The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God . Those who hear it will live .
43005026	" The Father has life in himself . He has also allowed the Son to have life in himself .
43005027	And the Father has given him the authority to judge . This is because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	" Do not be amazed at this . A time is coming when all who are in the grave will hear his voice .
43005029	They will all come out of their graves . Those who have done good will rise and live again . Those who have done evil will rise and be found guilty .
43005030	" I can do nothing by myself . I judge only as I hear . And my judging is fair . I do not try to please myself . I try only to please the One who sent me .
43005031	" If I give witness about myself , it doesn't count .
43005032	There is someone else who gives witness in my favor . And I know that his witness about me counts .
43005033	" You have sent people to John . He has given witness to the truth .
43005034	I do not accept human witness . I only talk about it so you can be saved .
43005035	John was like a lamp that burned and gave light . For a while you chose to enjoy his light .
43005036	" The witness I have is more important than John's . I am doing the very work the Father gave me to finish . It gives witness that the Father has sent me .
43005037	" The Father who sent me has himself given witness about me . You have never heard his voice . You have never seen what he really looks like .
43005038	And his word does not live in you . This is because you do not believe the One he sent .
43005039	" You study the Scriptures carefully . You study them because you think they will give you eternal life . The Scriptures you study give witness about me .
43005040	But you refuse to come to me and receive life .
43005041	" I do not accept praise from people .
43005042	But I know you . I know that you do not have love for God in your hearts .
43005043	I have come in my Father's name , and you do not accept me . But if someone else comes in his own name , you will accept him .
43005044	" You accept praise from one another . But you make no effort to receive the praise that comes from the only God . So how can you believe ?
43005045	" Do not think I will bring charges against you in front of the Father . Moses is the one who does that . And he is the one you build your hopes on .
43005046	" Do you believe Moses ? Then you should believe me . He wrote about me .
43005047	But you do not believe what he wrote . So how are you going to believe what I say ? "
43006001	Some time after this , Jesus crossed over to the other side of the Sea of Galilee . It is also called the Sea of Tiberias .
43006002	A large crowd of people followed him . They had seen the miraculous signs he had done on those who were sick .
43006003	Then Jesus went up on a mountainside . There he sat down with his disciples .
43006004	The Jewish Passover Feast was near .
43006005	Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him . So he said to Philip , " Where can we buy bread for these people to eat ? "
43006006	He asked this only to put Philip to the test . He already knew what he was going to do .
43006007	Philip answered him , " Eight months' pay would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite ! "
43006008	Another of his disciples spoke up . It was Andrew , Simon Peter's brother .
43006009	He said , " Here is a boy with five small loaves of barley bread . He also has two small fish . But how far will that go in such a large crowd ? "
43006010	Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " There was plenty of grass in that place , and they sat down . The number of men among them was about 5,000 .
43006011	Then Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks . He handed out the bread to those who were seated . He gave them as much as they wanted . And he did the same with the fish .
43006012	When all of them had enough to eat , Jesus spoke to his disciples . " Gather the leftover pieces , " he said . " Don't waste anything . "
43006013	So they gathered what was left over from the five barley loaves . They filled 12 baskets with the pieces left by those who had eaten .
43006014	The people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did . Then they began to say , " This must be the Prophet who is supposed to come into the world . "
43006015	But Jesus knew that they planned to come and force him to be their king . So he went away again to a mountain by himself .
43006016	When evening came , Jesus' disciples went down to the Sea of Galilee .
43006017	There they got into a boat and headed across the lake toward Capernaum . By now it was dark . Jesus had not yet joined them .
43006018	A strong wind was blowing , and the water became rough .
43006019	They rowed three or three and a half miles . Then they saw Jesus coming toward the boat . He was walking on the water . They were terrified .
43006020	But he said to them , " It is I . Don't be afraid . "
43006021	Then they agreed to take him into the boat . Right away the boat reached the shore where they were heading .
43006022	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the lake realized something . They saw that only one boat had been there . They knew that Jesus had not gotten into it with his disciples . And they knew that the disciples had gone away alone .
43006023	Then some boats from Tiberias landed . It was near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord gave thanks .
43006024	The crowd realized that Jesus and his disciples were not there . So they got into boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus .
43006025	They found him on the other side of the lake . They asked him , " Rabbi , when did you get here ? "
43006026	Jesus answered , " What I'm about to tell you is true . You are not looking for me because you saw miraculous signs . You are looking for me because you ate the loaves until you were full .
43006027	Do not work for food that spoils . Work for food that lasts forever . That is the food the Son of Man will give you . God the Father has put his seal of approval on him . "
43006028	Then they asked him , " What does God want from us ? What works does he want us to do ? "
43006029	Jesus answered , " God's work is to believe in the One he has sent . "
43006030	So they asked him , " What miraculous sign will you give us ? What will you do so we can see it and believe you ?
43006031	Long ago our people ate the manna in the desert . It is written in Scripture , ' The Lord gave them bread from heaven to eat . ' "
43006032	Jesus said to them , " What I'm about to tell you is true . It is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven . It is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	The bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven . He gives life to the world . "
43006034	" Sir , " they said , " give us this bread from now on . "
43006035	Then Jesus said , " I am the bread of life . No one who comes to me will ever go hungry . And no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty .
43006036	" But it is just as I told you . You have seen me , and you still do not believe .
43006037	Everyone the Father gives me will come to me . I will never send away anyone who comes to me .
43006038	" I have not come down from heaven to do what I want to do . I have come to do what the One who sent me wants me to do .
43006039	The One who sent me doesn't want me to lose anyone he has given me . He wants me to raise them up on the last day .
43006040	My Father wants all who look to the Son and believe in him to have eternal life . I will raise them up on the last day . "
43006041	Then the Jews began to complain about Jesus . That was because he said , " I am the bread that came down from heaven . "
43006042	They said , " Isn't this Jesus , the son of Joseph ? Don't we know his father and mother ? How can he now say , ' I came down from heaven ' ? "
43006043	" Stop complaining among yourselves , " Jesus answered .
43006044	" No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me brings him . Then I will raise him up on the last day .
43006045	" It is written in the Prophets , ' God will teach all of them . ' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me .
43006046	" No one has seen the Father except the One who has come from God . Only he has seen the Father .
43006047	What I'm about to tell you is true . Everyone who believes has life forever .
43006048	" I am the bread of life .
43006049	Long ago your people ate the manna in the desert , and they still died .
43006050	But here is the bread that comes down from heaven . A person can eat it and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Everyone who eats some of this bread will live forever . The bread is my body . I will give it for the life of the world . "
43006052	Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves . They said , " How can this man give us his body to eat ? "
43006053	Jesus said to them , " What I'm about to tell you is true . You must eat the Son of Man's body and drink his blood . If you don't , you have no life in you .
43006054	Anyone who eats my body and drinks my blood has eternal life . I will raise him up on the last day .
43006055	" My body is real food . My blood is real drink .
43006056	Anyone who eats my body and drinks my blood remains in me . And I remain in him .
43006057	" The living Father sent me , and I live because of him . In the same way , those who feed on me will live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread that came down from heaven . Long ago your people ate manna and died . But those who feed on this bread will live forever . "
43006059	He said this while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	Jesus' disciples heard this . Many of them said , " This is a hard teaching . Who can accept it ? "
43006061	Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining about his teaching . So he said to them , " Does this upset you ?
43006062	What if you see the Son of Man go up to where he was before ?
43006063	The Holy Spirit gives life . The body means nothing at all . The words I have spoken to you are from the Spirit . They give life .
43006064	But there are some of you who do not believe . " Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe . And he had known who was going to hand him over to his enemies .
43006065	So he continued speaking . He said , " This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father helps him . "
43006066	From this time on , many of his disciples turned back . They no longer followed him .
43006067	" You don't want to leave also , do you ? " Jesus asked the Twelve .
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , " Lord , who can we go to ? You have the words of eternal life .
43006069	We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God . "
43006070	Then Jesus replied , " Didn't I choose you , the 12 disciples ? But one of you is a devil ! "
43006071	He meant Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Judas was one of the Twelve . But later he was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies .
43007001	After this , Jesus went around in Galilee . He stayed away from Judea on purpose . He knew that the Jews there were waiting to kill him .
43007002	The Jewish Feast of Booths was near .
43007003	Jesus' brothers said to him , " You should leave here and go to Judea . Then your disciples will see the kinds of things you do .
43007004	No one who wants to be well known does things in secret . Since you are doing these things , show yourself to the world . "
43007005	Even Jesus' own brothers did not believe in him .
43007006	So Jesus told them , " The right time has not yet come for me . For you , any time is right .
43007007	The people of the world can't hate you . But they hate me . This is because I give witness that what they do is evil .
43007008	" You go to the Feast . I am not yet going up to this Feast . For me , the right time has not yet come . "
43007009	After he said this , he stayed in Galilee .
43007010	When his brothers had left for the Feast , he went also . But he went secretly , not openly .
43007011	At the Feast the Jews were watching for him . They were asking , " Where is he ? "
43007012	Many people in the crowd were whispering about him . Some said , " He is a good man . " Others replied , " No . He fools the people . "
43007013	But no one would say anything about him openly . They were afraid of the Jews .
43007014	Jesus did nothing until halfway through the Feast . Then he went up to the temple courtyard and began to teach .
43007015	The Jews were amazed . They asked , " How did this man learn so much without studying ? "
43007016	Jesus answered , " What I teach is not my own . It comes from the One who sent me .
43007017	Anyone who chooses to do what God wants him to do will find out whether my teaching comes from God or from me .
43007018	Someone who speaks on his own does it to get honor for himself . But someone who works for the honor of the One who sent him is truthful . There is nothing false about him .
43007019	" Didn't Moses give you the law ? But not one of you keeps the law . Why are you trying to kill me ? "
43007020	" You are controlled by demons , " the crowd answered . " Who is trying to kill you ? "
43007021	Jesus said to them , " I did one miracle , and you are all amazed .
43007022	Moses gave you circumcision , and so you circumcise a child on the Sabbath day . But circumcision did not really come from Moses . It came from Abraham .
43007023	You circumcise a child on the Sabbath day . You think that if you do , you won't break the law of Moses . Then why are you angry with me ? I healed a whole man on the Sabbath !
43007024	" Stop judging only by what you see . Judge correctly . "
43007025	Then some of the people of Jerusalem began asking questions . They said , " Isn't this the man some people are trying to kill ?
43007026	Here he is ! He is speaking openly . They aren't saying a word to him . Have the authorities really decided that he is the Christ ?
43007027	But we know where this man is from . When the Christ comes , no one will know where he is from . "
43007028	Jesus was still teaching in the temple courtyard . He cried out , " Yes , you know me . And you know where I am from . I am not here on my own . The One who sent me is true . You do not know him .
43007029	But I know him . I am from him , and he sent me . "
43007030	When he said this , they tried to arrest him . But no one laid a hand on him . His time had not yet come .
43007031	Still , many people in the crowd put their faith in him . They said , " How will it be when the Christ comes ? Will he do more miraculous signs than this man ? "
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering things like this about him . Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him .
43007033	Jesus said , " I am with you for only a short time . Then I will go to the One who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me , but you won't find me . You can't come where I am going . "
43007035	The Jews said to one another , " Where does this man plan to go ? Does he think we can't find him ? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks ? Will he go there to teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What did he mean when he said , ' You will look for me , but you won't find me ' ? And , ' You can't come where I am going ' ? "
43007037	It was the last and most important day of the Feast . Jesus stood up and spoke in a loud voice . He said , " Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink .
43007038	Does anyone believe in me ? Then , just as Scripture says , streams of living water will flow from inside him . "
43007039	When he said this , he meant the Holy Spirit . Those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit later . Up to that time , the Spirit had not been given . This was because Jesus had not yet received glory .
43007040	When some of the people heard his words , they said , " This man must be the Prophet we've been expecting . "
43007041	Others said , " He is the Christ . " Still others asked , " How can the Christ come from Galilee ?
43007042	Doesn't Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family ? Doesn't it say that he will come from Bethlehem , the town where David lived ? "
43007043	So the people did not agree about who Jesus was .
43007044	Some wanted to arrest him . But no one laid a hand on him .
43007045	Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees . They asked the guards , " Why didn't you bring him in ? "
43007046	" No one ever spoke the way this man does , " the guards replied .
43007047	" You mean he has fooled you also ? " the Pharisees asked .
43007048	" Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in him ?
43007049	No ! But this mob knows nothing about the law . There is a curse on them . "
43007050	Then Nicodemus , a Pharisee , spoke . He was the one who had gone to Jesus earlier . He asked ,
43007051	" Does our law find someone guilty without hearing him first ? Doesn't it want to find out what he is doing ? "
43007052	They replied , " Are you from Galilee too ? Look into it . You will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee . "
43007053	Then each of them went home .
43008001	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	At sunrise he arrived in the temple courtyard again . All the people gathered around him there . He sat down to teach them .
43008003	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman . She had been caught in adultery . They made her stand in front of the group .
43008004	They said to Jesus , " Teacher , this woman was caught having sex with a man who was not her husband .
43008005	In the Law , Moses commanded us to kill such women by throwing stones at them . Now what do you say ? "
43008006	They were trying to trap Jesus with that question . They wanted to have a reason to bring charges against him . But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger .
43008007	They kept asking him questions . So he stood up and said to them , " Has any one of you not sinned ? Then you be the first to throw a stone at her . "
43008008	He bent down again and wrote on the ground .
43008009	Those who heard what he had said began to go away . They left one at a time , the older ones first . Soon only Jesus was left . The woman was still standing there .
43008010	Jesus stood up and asked her , " Woman , where are they ? Hasn't anyone found you guilty ? "
43008011	" No one , sir , " she said . " Then I don't find you guilty either , " Jesus said . " Go now and leave your life of sin . "
43008012	Jesus spoke to the people again . He said , " I am the light of the world . Those who follow me will never walk in darkness . They will have the light that leads to life . "
43008013	The Pharisees argued with him . " Here you are , " they said , " appearing as your own witness . But your witness does not count . "
43008014	Jesus answered , " Even if I give witness about myself , my witness does count . I know where I came from . And I know where I am going . But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going .
43008015	You judge by human standards . I don't judge anyone .
43008016	" But if I do judge , what I decide is right . This is because I am not alone . I stand with the Father , who sent me .
43008017	Your own Law says that the witness of two is what counts .
43008018	I give witness about myself . My other witness is the Father , who sent me . "
43008019	Then they asked him , " Where is your father ? " " You do not know me or my Father , " Jesus replied . " If you knew me , you would know my Father also . "
43008020	He spoke these words while he was teaching in the temple area . He was near the place where the offerings were put . But no one arrested him . His time had not yet come .
43008021	Once more Jesus spoke to them . " I am going away , " he said . " You will look for me , and you will die in your sin . You can't come where I am going . "
43008022	This made the Jews ask , " Will he kill himself ? Is that why he says , ' You can't come where I am going ' ? "
43008023	But Jesus said , " You are from below . I am from heaven . You are from this world . I am not from this world .
43008024	I told you that you would die in your sins . Do you believe that I am the one I claim to be ? If you don't , you will certainly die in your sins . "
43008025	" Who are you ? " they asked . " Just what I have been claiming all along , " Jesus replied .
43008026	" I have a lot to say that will judge you . But the One who sent me can be trusted . And I tell the world what I have heard from him . "
43008027	They did not understand that Jesus was telling them about his Father .
43008028	So Jesus said , " You will lift up the Son of Man . Then you will know that I am the one I claim to be . You will also know that I do nothing on my own . I speak just what the Father has taught me .
43008029	The One who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , because I always do what pleases him . "
43008030	Even while Jesus was speaking , many people put their faith in him .
43008031	Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed him . " If you obey my teaching , " he said , " you are really my disciples .
43008032	Then you will know the truth . And the truth will set you free . "
43008033	They answered him , " We are Abraham's children . We have never been slaves of anyone . So how can you say that we will be set free ? "
43008034	Jesus replied , " What I'm about to tell you is true . Everyone who sins is a slave of sin .
43008035	A slave has no lasting place in the family . But a son belongs to the family forever .
43008036	So if the Son of Man sets you free , you will really be free .
43008037	" I know you are Abraham's children . But you are ready to kill me . You have no room for my word .
43008038	I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father . You do what you have heard from your father . "
43008039	" Abraham is our father , " they answered . Jesus said , " Are you really Abraham's children ? If you are , you will do the things Abraham did .
43008040	But you have decided to kill me . I am a man who has told you the truth I heard from God . Abraham didn't do the things you want to do .
43008041	You are doing the things your own father does . " " We are not children of people who weren't married to each other , " they objected . " The only Father we have is God himself . "
43008042	Jesus said to them , " If God were your Father , you would love me . I came from God , and now I am here . I have not come on my own . He sent me .
43008043	" Why aren't my words clear to you ? Because you can't really hear what I say .
43008044	You belong to your father , the devil . You want to obey your father's wishes . " From the beginning , the devil was a murderer . He has never obeyed the truth . There is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks his natural language . He does this because he is a liar . He is the father of lies .
43008045	" But because I tell the truth , you don't believe me !
43008046	Can any of you prove I am guilty of sinning ? Am I not telling the truth ? Then why don't you believe me ?
43008047	" Everyone who belongs to God hears what God says . The reason you don't hear is that you don't belong to God . "
43008048	The Jews answered Jesus , " Aren't we right when we say you are a Samaritan ? Aren't you controlled by a demon ? "
43008049	" I am not controlled by a demon , " said Jesus . " I honor my Father . You do not honor me .
43008050	I am not seeking glory for myself . But there is One who brings glory to me . He is the judge .
43008051	What I'm about to tell you is true . Anyone who obeys my word will never die . "
43008052	Then the Jews cried out , " Now we know you are controlled by a demon ! Abraham died . So did the prophets . But you say that anyone who obeys your word will never die .
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died . So did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? "
43008054	Jesus replied , " If I bring glory to myself , my glory means nothing . You claim that my Father is your God . He is the one who brings glory to me .
43008055	You do not know him . But I know him . If I said I did not , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him . And I obey his word .
43008056	" Your father Abraham was filled with joy at the thought of seeing my day . He saw it and was glad . "
43008057	" You are not even 50 years old , " the Jews said to Jesus . " And you have seen Abraham ? "
43008058	" What I'm about to tell you is true , " Jesus answered . " Before Abraham was born , I am ! "
43008059	When he said this , they picked up stones to kill him . But Jesus hid himself . He slipped away from the temple area .
43009001	As Jesus went along , he saw a man who was blind . He had been blind since he was born .
43009002	Jesus' disciples asked him , " Rabbi , who sinned ? Was this man born blind because he sinned ? Or did his parents sin ? "
43009003	" It isn't because this man sinned , " said Jesus . " It isn't because his parents sinned . This happened so that God's work could be shown in his life .
43009004	While it is still day , we must do the work of the One who sent me . Night is coming . Then no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . "
43009006	After he said this , he spit on the ground . He made some mud with the spit . Then he put the mud on the man's eyes .
43009007	" Go , " he told him . " Wash in the Pool of Siloam . " Siloam means Sent . So the man went and washed . And he came home able to see .
43009008	His neighbors and those who had earlier seen him begging asked questions . " Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg ? " they asked .
43009009	Some claimed that he was . Others said , " No . He only looks like him . " But the man who had been blind kept saying , " I am the man . "
43009010	" Then how were your eyes opened ? " they asked .
43009011	He replied , " The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes . He told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed . Then I could see . "
43009012	" Where is this man ? " they asked him . " I don't know , " he said .
43009013	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
43009014	The day Jesus made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath .
43009015	So the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see . " He put mud on my eyes , " the man replied . " Then I washed . And now I can see . "
43009016	Some of the Pharisees said , " Jesus has not come from God . He does not keep the Sabbath day . " But others asked , " How can a sinner do such miraculous signs ? " So the Pharisees did not agree with each other .
43009017	Finally they turned again to the blind man . " What do you have to say about him ? " they asked . " It was your eyes he opened . " The man replied , " He is a prophet . "
43009018	The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and now could see . So they sent for his parents .
43009019	" Is this your son ? " they asked . " Is this the one you say was born blind ? How is it that now he can see ? "
43009020	" We know he is our son , " the parents answered . " And we know he was born blind .
43009021	But we don't know how he can now see . And we don't know who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is an adult . He can speak for himself . "
43009022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews . The Jews had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue .
43009023	That was why the man's parents said , " He is an adult . Ask him . "
43009024	Again they called the man who had been blind to come to them . " Give glory to God by telling the truth ! " they said . " We know that the man who healed you is a sinner . "
43009025	He replied , " I don't know if he is a sinner or not . I do know one thing . I was blind , but now I can see ! "
43009026	Then they asked him , " What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? "
43009027	He answered , " I have already told you . But you didn't listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples too ? "
43009028	Then they began to attack him with their words . " You are this fellow's disciple ! " they said . " We are disciples of Moses !
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses . But we don't even know where this fellow comes from . "
43009030	The man answered , " That is really surprising ! You don't know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
43009031	We know that God does not listen to sinners . He listens to godly people who do what he wants them to do .
43009032	Nobody has ever heard of anyone opening the eyes of a person born blind .
43009033	If this man had not come from God , he could do nothing . "
43009034	Then the Pharisees replied , " When you were born , you were already deep in sin . How dare you talk like that to us ! " And they threw him out of the synagogue .
43009035	Jesus heard that the Pharisees had thrown the man out . When he found him , he said , " Do you believe in the Son of Man ? "
43009036	" Who is he , sir ? " the man asked . " Tell me , so I can believe in him . "
43009037	Jesus said , " You have now seen him . In fact , he is the one speaking with you . "
43009038	Then the man said , " Lord , I believe . " And he worshiped him .
43009039	Jesus said , " I have come into this world to judge it . I have come so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind . "
43009040	Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this . They asked , " What ? Are we blind too ? "
43009041	Jesus said , " If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin . But since you claim you can see , you remain guilty .
43010001	" What I'm about to tell you is true . What if someone does not enter the sheep pen through the gate but climbs in another way ? That person is a thief and a robber .
43010002	The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him . The sheep listen to his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	When he has brought all of his own sheep out , he goes on ahead of them . His sheep follow him because they know his voice .
43010005	But they will never follow a stranger . In fact , they will run away from him . They don't recognize a stranger's voice . "
43010006	Jesus used this story . But the Jews who were there didn't understand what he was telling them .
43010007	So Jesus said again , " What I'm about to tell you is true . I am like a gate for the sheep .
43010008	All those who ever came before me were thieves and robbers . But the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I'm like a gate . Anyone who enters through me will be saved . He will come in and go out . And he will find plenty of food .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy . I have come so they can have life . I want them to have it in the fullest possible way .
43010011	" I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .
43010012	The hired man is not the shepherd who owns the sheep . So when the hired man sees the wolf coming , he leaves the sheep and runs away . Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it .
43010013	The man runs away because he is a hired man . He does not care about the sheep .
43010014	" I am the good shepherd . I know my sheep , and my sheep know me .
43010015	They know me just as the Father knows me and I know the Father . And I give my life for the sheep .
43010016	" I have other sheep that do not belong to this sheep pen . I must bring them in too . They also will listen to my voice . Then there will be one flock and one shepherd .
43010017	" The reason my Father loves me is that I give up my life . But I will take it back again .
43010018	No one takes it from me . I give it up myself . I have the authority to give it up . And I have the authority to take it back again . I received this command from my Father . "
43010019	After Jesus spoke these words , the Jews again could not agree with each other .
43010020	Many of them said , " He is controlled by a demon . He has gone crazy ! Why should we listen to him ? "
43010021	But others said , " A person controlled by a demon does not say things like this . Can a demon open the eyes of someone who is blind ? "
43010022	Then came the Feast of Hanukkah at Jerusalem . It was winter .
43010023	Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Porch .
43010024	The Jews gathered around him . They said , " How long will you keep us waiting ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
43010025	Jesus answered , " I did tell you . But you do not believe . The kinds of things I do in my Father's name speak for me .
43010026	But you do not believe , because you are not my sheep .
43010027	" My sheep listen to my voice . I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life , and they will never die . No one can steal them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than anyone . No one can steal them out of my Father's hand .
43010030	I and the Father are one . "
43010031	Again the Jews picked up stones to kill him .
43010032	But Jesus said to them , " I have shown you many miracles from the Father . Which one of these are you throwing stones at me for ? "
43010033	" We are not throwing stones at you for any of these , " replied the Jews . " We are stoning you for saying a very evil thing . You are only a man . But you claim to be God . "
43010034	Jesus answered them , " Didn't God say in your Law , ' I have said you are gods' ?
43010035	We know that Scripture is always true . God spoke to some people and called them ' gods . '
43010036	If that is true , what about the One the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world ? Why do you charge me with saying a very evil thing ? Is it because I said , ' I am God's Son ' ?
43010037	" Don't believe me unless I do what my Father does .
43010038	But what if I do it ? Even if you don't believe me , believe the miracles . Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father . "
43010039	Again they tried to arrest him . But he escaped from them .
43010040	Then Jesus went back across the Jordan River . He went to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days . There he stayed .
43010041	Many people came to him . They said , " John never did a miraculous sign . But everything he said about this man was true . "
43010042	And in that place many believed in Jesus .
43011001	A man named Lazarus was sick . He was from Bethany , the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived .
43011002	Mary would later pour perfume on the Lord . She would also wipe his feet with her hair . Her brother Lazarus was sick in bed .
43011003	So the sisters sent a message to Jesus . " Lord , " they told him , " the one you love is sick . "
43011004	When Jesus heard this , he said , " This sickness will not end in death . No , it is for God's glory . God's Son will receive glory because of it . "
43011005	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	But after he heard Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was for two more days .
43011007	Then he said to his disciples , " Let us go back to Judea . "
43011008	" But Rabbi , " they said , " a short time ago the Jews tried to kill you with stones . Are you still going back there ? "
43011009	Jesus answered , " Aren't there 12 hours of daylight ? A person who walks during the day won't trip and fall . He can see because of this world's light .
43011010	But when he walks at night , he'll trip and fall . He has no light . "
43011011	After he said this , Jesus went on speaking to them . " Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , " he said . " But I am going there to wake him up . "
43011012	His disciples replied , " Lord , if he's sleeping , he will get better . "
43011013	Jesus had been speaking about the death of Lazarus . But his disciples thought he meant natural sleep .
43011014	So then he told them plainly , " Lazarus is dead .
43011015	For your benefit , I am glad I was not there . Now you will believe . But let us go to him . "
43011016	Then Thomas , who was called Didymus , spoke to the rest of the disciples . " Let us go also , " he said . " Then we can die with Jesus . "
43011017	When Jesus arrived , he found out that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days .
43011018	Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem .
43011019	Many Jews had come to Martha and Mary . They had come to comfort them because their brother was dead .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him . But Mary stayed at home .
43011021	" Lord , " Martha said to Jesus , " I wish you had been here ! Then my brother would not have died .
43011022	But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask for . "
43011023	Jesus said to her , " Your brother will rise again . "
43011024	Martha answered , " I know he will rise again . This will happen when people are raised from the dead on the last day . "
43011025	Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . Anyone who believes in me will live , even if he dies .
43011026	And those who live and believe in me will never die . Do you believe this ? "
43011027	" Yes , Lord , " she told him . " I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God . I believe that you are the One who was supposed to come into the world . "
43011028	After she said this , she went back home . She called her sister Mary to one side to talk to her . " The Teacher is here , " Martha said . " He is asking for you . "
43011029	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to him .
43011030	Jesus had not yet entered the village . He was still at the place where Martha had met him .
43011031	Some Jews had been comforting Mary in the house . They noticed how quickly she got up and went out . So they followed her . They thought she was going to the tomb to cry there .
43011032	Mary reached the place where Jesus was . When she saw him , she fell at his feet . She said , " Lord , I wish you had been here ! Then my brother would not have died . "
43011033	Jesus saw her crying . He saw that the Jews who had come along with her were crying also . His spirit became very sad , and he was troubled .
43011034	" Where have you put him ? " he asked . " Come and see , Lord , " they replied .
43011035	Jesus sobbed .
43011036	Then the Jews said , " See how much he loved him ! "
43011037	But some of them said , " He opened the eyes of the blind man . Couldn't he have kept this man from dying ? "
43011038	Once more Jesus felt very sad . He came to the tomb . It was a cave with a stone in front of the entrance .
43011039	" Take away the stone , " he said . " But , Lord , " said Martha , the sister of the dead man , " by this time there is a bad smell . Lazarus has been in the tomb for four days . "
43011040	Then Jesus said , " Didn't I tell you that if you believed , you would see God's glory ? "
43011041	So they took away the stone . Then Jesus looked up . He said , " Father , I thank you for hearing me .
43011042	I know that you always hear me . But I said this for the benefit of the people standing here . I said it so they will believe that you sent me . "
43011043	Then Jesus called in a loud voice . He said , " Lazarus , come out ! "
43011044	The dead man came out . His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of linen . A cloth was around his face . Jesus said to them , " Take off the clothes he was buried in and let him go . "
43011045	Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary saw what Jesus did . So they put their faith in him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees . They told the Pharisees what Jesus had done .
43011047	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin . " What can we do ? " they asked . " This man is doing many miraculous signs .
43011048	If we let him keep on doing this , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come . They will take away our temple and our nation . "
43011049	One of them spoke up . His name was Caiaphas . He was high priest at that time . He said , " You don't know anything at all !
43011050	You don't realize what is good for you . It is better if one man dies for the people than if the whole nation is destroyed . "
43011051	He did not say this on his own . But he was high priest at that time . So he told ahead of time that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation .
43011052	He also prophesied that Jesus would die for God's children scattered everywhere . He would die to bring them together and make them one .
43011053	So from that day on , the Jewish rulers planned to kill Jesus .
43011054	Jesus no longer moved around openly among the Jews . Instead , he went away to an area near the desert . He went to a village called Ephraim . There he stayed with his disciples .
43011055	It was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast . Many people went up from the country to Jerusalem . They went there for the special washing that would make them pure before the Passover Feast .
43011056	They kept looking for Jesus as they stood in the temple area . They asked one another , " What do you think ? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all ? "
43011057	But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders . They had commanded anyone who found out where Jesus was staying to report it . Then they could arrest him .
43012001	It was six days before the Passover Feast . Jesus arrived at Bethany , where Lazarus lived . Lazarus was the one Jesus had raised from the dead .
43012002	A dinner was given at Bethany to honor Jesus . Martha served the food . Lazarus was among those at the table with Jesus .
43012003	Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard . It was an expensive perfume . She poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped them with her hair . The house was filled with the sweet smell of the perfume .
43012004	But Judas Iscariot didn't like what Mary did . He was one of Jesus' disciples . Later he was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies . Judas said ,
43012005	" Why wasn't this perfume sold ? Why wasn't the money given to poor people ? It was worth a year's pay . "
43012006	He didn't say this because he cared about the poor . He said it because he was a thief . Judas was in charge of the money bag . He used to help himself to what was in it .
43012007	" Leave her alone , " Jesus replied . " The perfume was meant for the day I am buried .
43012008	You will always have the poor among you . But you won't always have me . "
43012009	Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there , so they came . But they did not come only because of Jesus . They also came to see Lazarus . After all , Jesus had raised him from the dead .
43012010	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus too .
43012011	Because of Lazarus , many of the Jews were starting to follow Jesus . They were putting their faith in him .
43012012	The next day the large crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem .
43012013	So they took branches from palm trees and went out to meet him . They shouted , " Hosanna ! " " Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! " " Blessed is the King of Israel ! "
43012014	Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it . This is just as it is written in Scripture . It says ,
43012015	" City of Zion , do not be afraid . See , your king is coming . He is sitting on a donkey's colt . "
43012016	At first , Jesus' disciples did not understand all this . They realized it only after he had received glory . Then they realized that these things had been written about him . They realized that the people had done these things to him .
43012017	A crowd had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead . So they continued to tell everyone about what had happened .
43012018	Many people went out to meet him . They had heard that he had done this miraculous sign .
43012019	So the Pharisees said to one another , " This isn't getting us anywhere . Look how the whole world is following him ! "
43012020	There were some Greeks among the people who went up to worship during the Feast .
43012021	They came to ask Philip for a favor . Philip was from Bethsaida in Galilee . " Sir , " they said , " we would like to see Jesus . "
43012022	Philip went to tell Andrew . Then Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus replied , " The hour has come for the Son of Man to receive glory .
43012024	What I'm about to tell you is true . Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies , it remains only one seed . But if it dies , it produces many seeds .
43012025	" Anyone who loves his life will lose it . But anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it and have eternal life .
43012026	Anyone who serves me must follow me . And where I am , my servant will also be . My Father will honor the one who serves me .
43012027	" My heart is troubled . What should I say ? ' Father , save me from this hour ' ? No . This is the very reason I came to this hour .
43012028	Father , bring glory to your name ! " Then a voice came from heaven . It said , " I have brought glory to my name . I will bring glory to it again . "
43012029	The crowd there heard the voice . Some said it was thunder . Others said an angel had spoken to Jesus .
43012030	Jesus said , " This voice was for your benefit , not mine .
43012031	Now it is time for the world to be judged . Now the prince of this world will be thrown out .
43012032	But I am going to be lifted up from the earth . When I am , I will bring all people to myself . "
43012033	He said this to show them how he was going to die .
43012034	The crowd spoke up . " The Law tells us that the Christ will remain forever , " they said . " So how can you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ' ? Who is this ' Son of Man ' ? "
43012035	Then Jesus told them , " You are going to have the light just a little while longer . Walk while you have the light . Do this before darkness catches up with you . Anyone who walks in the dark does not know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the light , put your trust in it . Then you can become sons of light . " When Jesus had finished speaking , he left and hid from them .
43012037	Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in front of them . But they still would not believe in him .
43012038	This happened as Isaiah the prophet had said it would . He had said , " Lord , who has believed what we've been saying ? Who has seen the Lord's saving power ? "
43012039	For this reason , they could not believe . As Isaiah says in another place ,
43012040	" The Lord has blinded their eyes . He has closed their minds . So they can't see with their eyes . They can't understand with their minds . They can't turn to the Lord . If they could , he would heal them . "
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him .
43012042	At the same time that Jesus did those miracles , many of the leaders believed in him . But because of the Pharisees , they would not admit they believed . They were afraid they would be thrown out of the synagogue .
43012043	They loved praise from people more than praise from God .
43012044	Then Jesus cried out , " Anyone who believes in me does not believe in me only . He also believes in the One who sent me .
43012045	When he looks at me , he sees the One who sent me .
43012046	" I have come into the world to be a light . No one who believes in me will stay in darkness .
43012047	" I don't judge a person who hears my words but does not obey them . I didn't come to judge the world . I came to save it .
43012048	But there is a judge for anyone who does not accept me and my words . The very words I have spoken will judge him on the last day .
43012049	" I did not speak on my own . The Father who sent me commanded me what to say . He also told me how to say it .
43012050	I know that his command leads to eternal life . So everything I say is just what the Father has told me to say . "
43013001	It was just before the Passover Feast . Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world . It was time for him to go to the Father . Jesus loved his disciples who were in the world . So he now showed them how much he really loved them .
43013002	The evening meal was being served . The devil had already tempted Judas Iscariot , son of Simon . He had told Judas to hand Jesus over to his enemies .
43013003	Jesus knew that the Father had put everything under his power . He also knew he had come from God and was returning to God .
43013004	So he got up from the meal and took off his outer clothes . He wrapped a towel around his waist .
43013005	After that , he poured water into a large bowl . Then he began to wash his disciples' feet . He dried them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
43013006	He came to Simon Peter . " Lord , " Peter said to him , " are you going to wash my feet ? "
43013007	Jesus replied , " You don't realize now what I am doing . But later you will understand . "
43013008	" No , " said Peter . " You will never wash my feet . " Jesus answered , " Unless I wash you , you can't share life with me . "
43013009	" Lord , " Simon Peter replied , " not just my feet ! Wash my hands and my head too ! "
43013010	Jesus answered , " A person who has had a bath needs to wash only his feet . The rest of his body is clean . And you are clean . But not all of you are . "
43013011	Jesus knew who was going to hand him over to his enemies . That was why he said not every one was clean .
43013012	When Jesus finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes . Then he returned to his place . " Do you understand what I have done for you ? " he asked them .
43013013	" You call me ' Teacher ' and ' Lord . ' You are right . That is what I am .
43013014	I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet . So you also should wash one another's feet .
43013015	I have given you an example . You should do as I have done for you .
43013016	" What I'm about to tell you is true . A servant is not more important than his master . And a messenger is not more important than the one who sends him .
43013017	Now you know these things . So you will be blessed if you do them .
43013018	" I am not talking about all of you . I know those I have chosen . But this will happen so that Scripture will come true . It says , ' The one who shares my bread has deserted me . '
43013019	" I am telling you now , before it happens . When it does happen , you will believe that I am he .
43013020	What I'm about to tell you is true . Anyone who accepts someone I send accepts me . And anyone who accepts me accepts the One who sent me . "
43013021	After he had said this , Jesus' spirit was troubled . Here is the witness he gave . " What I'm about to tell you is true , " he said . " One of you is going to hand me over to my enemies . "
43013022	His disciples stared at one another . They had no idea which one of them he meant .
43013023	The disciple Jesus loved was next to him at the table .
43013024	Simon Peter motioned to that disciple . He said , " Ask Jesus which one he means . "
43013025	The disciple was leaning back against Jesus . He asked him , " Lord , who is it ? "
43013026	Jesus answered , " It is the one I will give this piece of bread to . I will give it to him after I have dipped it in the dish . " He dipped the piece of bread . Then he gave it to Judas Iscariot , son of Simon .
43013027	As soon as Judas took the bread , Satan entered into him . " Do quickly what you are going to do , " Jesus told him .
43013028	But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him .
43013029	Judas was in charge of the money . So some of the disciples thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast . Others thought Jesus was talking about giving something to poor people .
43013030	As soon as Judas had taken the bread , he went out . And it was night .
43013031	After Judas was gone , Jesus spoke . He said , " Now the Son of Man receives glory . And he brings glory to God .
43013032	If the Son brings glory to God , God himself will bring glory to the Son . God will do it at once .
43013033	" My children , I will be with you only a little longer . You will look for me . Just as I told the Jews , so I am telling you now . You can't come where I am going .
43013034	" I give you a new command . Love one another . You must love one another , just as I have loved you .
43013035	If you love one another , everyone will know you are my disciples . "
43013036	Simon Peter asked him , " Lord , where are you going ? " Jesus replied , " Where I am going you can't follow now . But you will follow me later . "
43013037	" Lord , " Peter asked , " why can't I follow you now ? I will give my life for you . "
43013038	Then Jesus answered , " Will you really give your life for me ? What I'm about to tell you is true . Before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you don't know me !
43014001	" Do not let your hearts be troubled . Trust in God . Trust in me also .
43014002	" There are many rooms in my Father's house . If this were not true , I would have told you . I am going there to prepare a place for you .
43014003	If I go and do that , I will come back . And I will take you to be with me . Then you will also be where I am .
43014004	" You know the way to the place where I am going . "
43014005	Thomas said to him , " Lord , we don't know where you are going . So how can we know the way ? "
43014006	Jesus answered , " I am the way and the truth and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
43014007	If you really knew me , you would know my Father also . From now on , you do know him . And you have seen him . "
43014008	Philip said , " Lord , show us the Father . That will be enough for us . "
43014009	Jesus answered , " Don't you know me , Philip ? I have been among you such a long time ! Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father . So how can you say , ' Show us the Father ' ?
43014010	" Don't you believe that I am in the Father ? Don't you believe that the Father is in me ? The words I say to you are not just my own . The Father lives in me . He is the One who is doing his work .
43014011	Believe me when I say I am in the Father . Also believe that the Father is in me . Or at least believe what the miracles show about me .
43014012	" What I'm about to tell you is true . Anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing . In fact , he will do even greater things . That is because I am going to the Father .
43014013	" And I will do anything you ask in my name . Then the Son will bring glory to the Father .
43014014	You may ask me for anything in my name . I will do it .
43014015	" If you love me , you will obey what I command .
43014016	I will ask the Father . And he will give you another Friend to help you and to be with you forever .
43014017	The Friend is the Spirit of truth . The world can't accept him . That is because the world does not see him or know him . But you know him . He lives with you , and he will be in you .
43014018	" I will not leave you like children who don't have parents . I will come to you .
43014019	" Before long , the world will not see me anymore . But you will see me . Because I live , you will live also .
43014020	On that day you will realize that I am in my Father . You will know that you are in me , and I am in you .
43014021	" Anyone who has my commands and obeys them loves me . My Father will love the one who loves me . I too will love him . And I will show myself to him . "
43014022	Then Judas spoke . " Lord , " he said , " why do you plan to show yourself only to us ? Why not also to the world ? " The Judas who spoke those words was not Judas Iscariot .
43014023	Jesus replied , " Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching . My Father will love him . We will come to him and make our home with him .
43014024	Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching . The words you hear me say are not my own . They belong to the Father who sent me .
43014025	" I have spoken all these things while I am still with you .
43014026	But the Father will send the Friend in my name to help you . The Friend is the Holy Spirit . He will teach you all things . He will remind you of everything I have said to you .
43014027	" I leave my peace with you . I give my peace to you . I do not give it to you as the world does . Do not let your hearts be troubled . And do not be afraid .
43014028	" You heard me say , ' I am going away . And I am coming back to you . ' If you loved me , you would be glad I am going to the Father . The Father is greater than I am .
43014029	I have told you now before it happens . Then when it does happen , you will believe .
43014030	" I will not speak with you much longer . The prince of this world is coming . He has no power over me .
43014031	But the world must learn that I love the Father . They must also learn that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me to do . " Come now . Let us leave .
43015001	" I am the true vine . My Father is the gardener .
43015002	He cuts off every branch joined to me that does not bear fruit . He trims every branch that does bear fruit . Then it will bear even more fruit .
43015003	" You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you .
43015004	Remain joined to me , and I will remain joined to you . No branch can bear fruit by itself . It must remain joined to the vine . In the same way , you can't bear fruit unless you remain joined to me .
43015005	" I am the vine . You are the branches . If anyone remains joined to me , and I to him , he will bear a lot of fruit . You can't do anything without me .
43015006	If anyone does not remain joined to me , he is like a branch that is thrown away and dries up . Branches like those are picked up . They are thrown into the fire and burned .
43015007	" If you remain joined to me and my words remain in you , ask for anything you wish . And it will be given to you .
43015008	When you bear a lot of fruit , it brings glory to my Father . It shows that you are my disciples .
43015009	" Just as the Father has loved me , I have loved you . Now remain in my love .
43015010	If you obey my commands , you will remain in my love . In the same way , I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love .
43015011	I have told you this so that my joy will be in you . I also want your joy to be complete .
43015012	" Here is my command . Love each other , just as I have loved you .
43015013	No one has greater love than the one who gives his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command .
43015015	" I do not call you servants anymore . Servants do not know their master's business . Instead , I have called you friends . I have told you everything I learned from my Father .
43015016	" You did not choose me . Instead , I chose you . I appointed you to go and bear fruit . It is fruit that will last . Then the Father will give you anything you ask for in my name .
43015017	" Here is my command . Love each other .
43015018	" Does the world hate you ? Remember that it hated me first .
43015019	If you belonged to the world , it would love you like one of its own . But you do not belong to the world . I have chosen you out of the world . That is why the world hates you .
43015020	" Remember the words I spoke to you . I said , ' A servant is not more important than his master . ' If people hated me and tried to hurt me , they will do the same to you . If they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours also .
43015021	They will treat you like that because of my name . They do not know the One who sent me .
43015022	" If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	Those who hate me hate my Father also .
43015024	" I did miracles among them that no one else did . If I hadn't , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have seen those miracles . And still they have hated both me and my Father .
43015025	This has happened so that what is written in their Law would come true . It says , ' They hated me without any reason . '
43015026	" I will send the Friend to you from the Father . He is the Spirit of truth , who comes out from the Father . When the Friend comes to help you , he will give witness about me .
43015027	" You also must give witness . This is because you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	" I have told you all of this so that you will not go down the wrong path .
43016002	You will be thrown out of the synagogue . In fact , a time is coming when those who kill you will think they are doing God a favor .
43016003	They will do things like that because they do not know the Father or me .
43016004	" Why have I told you this ? So that when the time comes , you will remember that I warned you . I didn't tell you this at first because I was with you .
43016005	" Now I am going to the One who sent me . But none of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
43016006	Because I have said these things , you are filled with sadness .
43016007	" But what I'm about to tell you is true . It is for your good that I am going away . Unless I go away , the Friend will not come to help you . But if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	When he comes , he will prove that the world's people are guilty . He will prove their guilt concerning sin and godliness and judgment .
43016009	" The world is guilty as far as sin is concerned . That is because people do not believe in me .
43016010	The world is guilty as far as godliness is concerned . That is because I am going to the Father , where you can't see me anymore .
43016011	The world is guilty as far as judgment is concerned . That is because the devil , the prince of this world , has already been judged .
43016012	" I have much more to say to you . It is more than you can handle right now .
43016013	But when the Spirit of truth comes , he will guide you into all truth . He will not speak on his own . He will speak only what he hears . And he will tell you what is still going to happen .
43016014	" He will bring me glory by receiving something from me and showing it to you .
43016015	Everything that belongs to the Father is mine . That is why I said the Holy Spirit will receive something from me and show it to you .
43016016	" In a little while , you will no longer see me . Then after a little while , you will see me . "
43016017	Some of his disciples spoke to one another . They said , " What does he mean by saying , ' In a little while , you will no longer see me . Then after a little while , you will see me ' ? And what does he mean by saying , ' I am going to the Father ' ? "
43016018	They kept asking , " What does he mean by ' a little while ' ? We don't understand what he is saying . "
43016019	Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about those things . So he said to them , " Are you asking one another what I meant ? Didn't you understand when I said , ' In a little while , you will no longer see me . Then after a little while , you will see me ' ?
43016020	What I'm about to tell you is true . You will cry and be full of sorrow while the world is full of joy . You will be sad , but your sadness will turn into joy .
43016021	" A woman giving birth to a baby has pain . This is because her time to give birth has come . But when her baby is born , she forgets the pain . She forgets because she is so happy that a baby has been born into the world .
43016022	" That's the way it is with you . Now it's your time to be sad . But I will see you again . Then you will be full of joy . And no one will take your joy away .
43016023	" When that day comes , you will no longer ask me for anything . What I'm about to tell you is true . My Father will give you anything you ask for in my name .
43016024	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask , and you will receive what you ask for . Then your joy will be complete .
43016025	" I have not been speaking to you plainly . But a time is coming when I will speak clearly . Then I will tell you plainly about my Father .
43016026	When that day comes , you will ask for things in my name . I am not saying I will ask the Father instead of you asking him .
43016027	No , the Father himself loves you because you have loved me . He also loves you because you have believed that I came from God .
43016028	" I came from the Father and entered the world . Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father . "
43016029	Then Jesus' disciples said , " Now you are speaking plainly . You are using examples that are clear .
43016030	Now we can see that you know everything . You don't even need anyone to ask you questions . This makes us believe that you came from God . "
43016031	" At last you believe ! " Jesus said .
43016032	" But a time is coming when you will be scattered and go to your own homes . In fact , that time is already here . You will leave me all alone . But I am not really alone . My Father is with me .
43016033	" I have told you these things , so that you can have peace because of me . In this world you will have trouble . But cheer up ! I have won the battle over the world . "
43017001	After Jesus said this , he looked toward heaven and prayed . He said , " Father , the time has come . Bring glory to your Son . Then your Son will bring glory to you .
43017002	You gave him authority over all people . He gives eternal life to all those you have given him .
43017003	" And what is eternal life ? It is knowing you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom you have sent .
43017004	I have brought you glory on earth . I have finished the work you gave me to do .
43017005	So now , Father , give glory to me in heaven where your throne is . Give me the glory I had with you before the world began .
43017006	" I have shown you to the disciples you gave me out of the world . They were yours . You gave them to me . And they have obeyed your word .
43017007	Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you .
43017008	I gave them the words you gave me . And they accepted them . They knew for certain that I came from you . They believed that you sent me .
43017009	" I pray for them . I am not praying for the world . I am praying for those you have given me , because they are yours .
43017010	All I have is yours , and all you have is mine . Glory has come to me because of my disciples .
43017011	" I will not remain in the world any longer . But they are still in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them safe by the power of your name . It is the name you gave me . Keep them safe so they can be one , just as you and I are one .
43017012	" While I was with them , I guarded them . I kept them safe through the name you gave me . None of them has been lost , except the one who was sentenced to be destroyed . It happened so that Scripture would come true .
43017013	" I am coming to you now . But I say these things while I am still in the world . I say them so that those you gave me can have all my joy inside them .
43017014	I have given them your word . The world has hated them . This is because they are not part of the world any more than I am .
43017015	I do not pray that you will take them out of the world . I pray that you will keep them safe from the evil one .
43017016	" They do not belong to the world , just as I do not belong to it .
43017017	Use the truth to make them holy . Your word is truth .
43017018	You sent me into the world . In the same way , I have sent them into the world .
43017019	I make myself holy for them so that they too can be made holy in a true sense .
43017020	" I do not pray only for them . I pray also for those who will believe in me because of their message .
43017021	Father , I pray that all of them will be one , just as you are in me and I am in you . I want them also to be in us . Then the world will believe that you have sent me .
43017022	" I have given them the glory you gave me . I did this so they would be one , just as we are one .
43017023	I will be in them , just as you are in me . I want them to be brought together perfectly as one . This will let the world know that you sent me . It will also show the world that you have loved those you gave me , just as you have loved me .
43017024	" Father , I want those you have given me to be with me where I am . I want them to see my glory , the glory you have given me . You gave it to me because you loved me before the world was created .
43017025	" Father , you are holy . The world does not know you , but I know you . Those you have given me know you have sent me .
43017026	I have shown you to them . And I will continue to show you to them . Then the love you have for me will be in them . I myself will be in them . "
43018001	When Jesus had finished praying , he left with his disciples . They crossed the Kidron Valley . On the other side there was a grove of olive trees . Jesus and his disciples went into it .
43018002	Judas knew the place . He was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies . Jesus had often met in that place with his disciples .
43018003	So Judas came to the grove . He was guiding a group of soldiers and some officials . The chief priests and the Pharisees had sent them . They were carrying torches , lanterns and weapons .
43018004	Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him . So he went out and asked them , " Who is it that you want ? "
43018005	" Jesus of Nazareth , " they replied . " I am he , " Jesus said . Judas , who was going to hand Jesus over , was standing there with them .
43018006	When Jesus said , " I am he , " they moved back . Then they fell to the ground .
43018007	He asked them again , " Who is it that you want ? " They said , " Jesus of Nazareth . "
43018008	" I told you I am he , " Jesus answered . " If you are looking for me , then let these men go . "
43018009	This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would come true . He had said , " I have not lost anyone God has given me . "
43018010	Simon Peter had a sword and pulled it out . He struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear . The servant's name was Malchus .
43018011	Jesus commanded Peter , " Put your sword away ! Shouldn't I drink the cup of suffering the Father has given me ? "
43018012	Then the group of soldiers , their leader and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus . They tied him up
43018013	and brought him first to Annas . He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest at that time .
43018014	Caiaphas had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people .
43018015	Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus . The high priest knew the other disciple . So that disciple went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard .
43018016	But Peter had to wait outside by the door . The other disciple came back . He was the one the high priest knew . He spoke to the woman who was on duty there . Then he brought Peter in .
43018017	The woman at the door spoke to Peter . " You are not one of Jesus' disciples , are you ? " she asked him . " I am not , " he replied .
43018018	It was cold . The servants and officials stood around a fire . They had made it to keep warm . Peter was also standing with them . He was warming himself .
43018019	Meanwhile , the high priest questioned Jesus . He asked him about his disciples and his teaching .
43018020	" I have spoken openly to the world , " Jesus replied . " I always taught in synagogues or at the temple , where all the Jews come together . I didn't say anything in secret .
43018021	Why question me ? Ask the people who heard me . They certainly know what I said . "
43018022	When Jesus said that , one of the officials nearby hit him in the face . " Is this any way to answer the high priest ? " he asked .
43018023	" Have I said something wrong ? " Jesus replied . " If I have , give witness to it . But if I spoke the truth , why did you hit me ? "
43018024	While Jesus was still tied up , Annas sent him to Caiaphas , the high priest .
43018025	Simon Peter stood there . He was warming himself . Then someone asked him , " You aren't one of Jesus' disciples , are you ? " He said , " I am not . "
43018026	One of the high priest's servants was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off . He said to Peter , " Didn't I see you with Jesus in the olive grove ? "
43018027	Again Peter said no . At that very moment a rooster began to crow .
43018028	Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor . By now it was early morning . The Jews did not want to be made " unclean . " They wanted to be able to eat the Passover meal . So they did not enter the palace .
43018029	Pilate came out to them . He asked , " What charges are you bringing against this man ? "
43018030	" He has committed crimes , " they replied . " If he hadn't , we would not have handed him over to you . "
43018031	Pilate said , " Take him yourselves . Judge him by your own law . " " But we don't have the right to put anyone to death , " the Jews complained .
43018032	This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken about how he was going to die would come true .
43018033	Then Pilate went back inside the palace . He ordered Jesus to be brought to him . Pilate asked him , " Are you the king of the Jews ? "
43018034	" Is that your own idea ? " Jesus asked . " Or did others talk to you about me ? "
43018035	" Am I a Jew ? " Pilate replied . " It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me . What have you done ? "
43018036	Jesus said , " My kingdom is not part of this world . If it were , those who serve me would fight . They would try to keep the Jews from arresting me . My kingdom is from another place . "
43018037	" So you are a king , then ! " said Pilate . Jesus answered , " You are right to say I am a king . In fact , that's the reason I was born . I came into the world to give witness to the truth . Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to me . "
43018038	" What is truth ? " Pilate asked . Then Pilate went out again to the Jews . He said , " I find no basis for any charge against him .
43018039	But it is your practice for me to set one prisoner free for you at Passover time . Do you want me to set ' the king of the Jews' free ? "
43018040	They shouted back , " No ! Not him ! Give us Barabbas ! " Barabbas had taken part in an armed struggle against the country's rulers .
43019001	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped .
43019002	The soldiers twisted thorns together to make a crown . They put it on Jesus' head . Then they put a purple robe on him .
43019003	They went up to him again and again . They kept saying , " We honor you , king of the Jews ! " And they hit him in the face .
43019004	Once more Pilate came out . He said to the Jews , " Look , I am bringing Jesus out to you . I want to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
43019005	Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Then Pilate said to them , " Here is the man ! "
43019006	As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him , they shouted , " Crucify him ! Crucify him ! " But Pilate answered , " You take him and crucify him . I myself find no basis for a charge against him . "
43019007	The Jews replied , " We have a law . That law says he must die . He claimed to be the Son of God . "
43019008	When Pilate heard that , he was even more afraid .
43019009	He went back inside the palace . " Where do you come from ? " he asked Jesus . But Jesus did not answer him .
43019010	" Do you refuse to speak to me ? " Pilate said . " Don't you understand ? I have the power to set you free or to nail you to a cross . "
43019011	Jesus answered , " You were given power from heaven . If you weren't , you would have no power over me . So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . "
43019012	From then on , Pilate tried to set Jesus free . But the Jews kept shouting , " If you let this man go , you are not Caesar's friend ! Anyone who claims to be a king is against Caesar ! "
43019013	When Pilate heard that , he brought Jesus out . Pilate sat down on the judge's seat . It was at a place called The Stone Walkway . In the Aramaic language it was called Gabbatha .
43019014	It was about noon on Preparation Day in Passover Week . " Here is your king , " Pilate said to the Jews .
43019015	But they shouted , " Kill him ! Kill him ! Crucify him ! " " Should I crucify your king ? " Pilate asked . " We have no king but Caesar , " the chief priests answered .
43019016	Finally , Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be nailed to a cross . So the soldiers took charge of Jesus .
43019017	He had to carry his own cross . He went out to a place called The Skull . In the Aramaic language it was called Golgotha .
43019018	There they nailed Jesus to the cross . Two other men were crucified with him . One was on each side of him . Jesus was in the middle .
43019019	Pilate had a notice prepared . It was fastened to the cross . It read , jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
43019020	Many of the Jews read the sign . The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city . The sign was written in the Aramaic , Latin and Greek languages .
43019021	The chief priests of the Jews argued with Pilate . They said , " Do not write ' The King of the Jews . ' Write that this man claimed to be king of the Jews . "
43019022	Pilate answered , " I have written what I have written . "
43019023	When the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes . They divided them into four parts . Each soldier got one part . Jesus' long , inner robe was left . It did not have any seams . It was made out of one piece of cloth from top to bottom .
43019024	" Let's not tear it , " they said to one another . " Let's cast lots to see who will get it . " This happened so that Scripture would come true . It says , " They divided up my clothes among them . They cast lots for what I was wearing . " So that is what the soldiers did .
43019025	Jesus' mother stood near his cross . So did his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	Jesus saw his mother there . He also saw the disciple he loved standing nearby . Jesus said to his mother , " Dear woman , here is your son . "
43019027	He said to the disciple , " Here is your mother . " From that time on , the disciple took her into his home .
43019028	Later Jesus said , " I am thirsty . " He knew that everything was now finished . He knew that what Scripture said must come true .
43019029	A jar of wine vinegar was there . So they soaked a sponge in it . They put the sponge on a stem of the hyssop plant . Then they lifted it up to Jesus' lips .
43019030	After Jesus drank he said , " It is finished . " Then he bowed his head and died .
43019031	It was Preparation Day . The next day would be a special Sabbath . The Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath . So they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down .
43019032	The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus . Then they broke the legs of the other man .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead . So they did not break his legs .
43019034	Instead , one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus' side . Right away , blood and water flowed out .
43019035	The man who saw it has given witness . And his witness is true . He knows that he tells the truth . He gives witness so that you also can believe .
43019036	These things happened in order that Scripture would come true . It says , " Not one of his bones will be broken . "
43019037	Scripture also says , " They will look to the one they have pierced . "
43019038	Later Joseph asked Pilate for Jesus' body . Joseph was from the town of Arimathea . He was a follower of Jesus . But he followed Jesus secretly because he was afraid of the Jews . After Pilate gave him permission , Joseph came and took the body away .
43019039	Nicodemus went with Joseph . He was the man who had earlier visited Jesus at night . Nicodemus brought some mixed spices , about 75 pounds .
43019040	The two men took Jesus' body . They wrapped it in strips of linen cloth , along with the spices . That was the way the Jews buried people's bodies .
43019041	At the place where Jesus was crucified , there was a garden . A new tomb was there . No one had ever been put in it before .
43019042	That day was the Jewish Preparation Day , and the tomb was nearby . So they placed Jesus there .
43020001	Early on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb . It was still dark . She saw that the stone had been moved away from the entrance .
43020002	So she ran to Simon Peter and another disciple , the one Jesus loved . She said , " They have taken the Lord out of the tomb ! We don't know where they have put him ! "
43020003	So Peter and the other disciple started out for the tomb .
43020004	Both of them were running . The other disciple ran faster than Peter . He reached the tomb first .
43020005	He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there . But he did not go in .
43020006	Then Simon Peter , who was behind him , arrived . He went into the tomb . He saw the strips of linen lying there .
43020007	He also saw the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head . The cloth was folded up by itself . It was separate from the linen .
43020008	The disciple who had reached the tomb first also went inside . He saw and believed .
43020009	They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples went back to their homes .
43020011	But Mary stood outside the tomb crying . As she cried , she bent over to look into the tomb .
43020012	She saw two angels dressed in white . They were seated where Jesus' body had been . One of them was where Jesus' head had been laid . The other sat where his feet had been placed .
43020013	They asked her , " Woman , why are you crying ? " " They have taken my Lord away , " she said . " I don't know where they have put him . "
43020014	Then she turned around and saw Jesus standing there . But she didn't realize that it was Jesus .
43020015	" Woman , " he said , " why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? " She thought he was the gardener . So she said , " Sir , did you carry him away ? Tell me where you put him . Then I will go and get him . "
43020016	Jesus said to her , " Mary . " She turned toward him . Then she cried out in the Aramaic language , " Rabboni ! " Rabboni means Teacher .
43020017	Jesus said , " Do not hold on to me . I have not yet returned to the Father . Instead , go to those who believe in me . Tell them , ' I am returning to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ' "
43020018	Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news . She said , " I have seen the Lord ! " And she told them that he had said these things to her .
43020019	On the evening of that first day of the week , the disciples were together . They had locked the doors because they were afraid of the Jews . Jesus came in and stood among them . He said , " May peace be with you ! "
43020020	Then he showed them his hands and his side . The disciples were very happy when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Again Jesus said , " May peace be with you ! The Father has sent me . So now I am sending you . "
43020022	He then breathed on them . He said , " Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive anyone's sins , they are forgiven . If you do not forgive them , they are not forgiven . "
43020024	Thomas was one of the Twelve . He was called Didymus . He was not with the other disciples when Jesus came .
43020025	So they told him , " We have seen the Lord ! " But he said to them , " First I must see the nail marks in his hands . I must put my finger where the nails were . I must put my hand into his side . Only then will I believe what you say . "
43020026	A week later , Jesus' disciples were in the house again . Thomas was with them . Even though the doors were locked , Jesus came in and stood among them . He said , " May peace be with you ! "
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , " Put your finger here . See my hands . Reach out your hand and put it into my side . Stop doubting and believe . "
43020028	Thomas said to him , " My Lord and my God ! "
43020029	Then Jesus told him , " Because you have seen me , you have believed . Blessed are those who have not seen me but still have believed . "
43020030	Jesus did many other miraculous signs in front of his disciples . They are not written down in this book .
43020031	But these are written down so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God . If you believe this , you will have life because you belong to him .
43021001	After this , Jesus appeared to his disciples again . It was by the Sea of Galilee . Here is what happened .
43021002	Simon Peter and Thomas , who was called Didymus , were there together . Nathanael from Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee were with them . So were two other disciples .
43021003	" I'm going out to fish , " Simon Peter told them . They said , " We'll go with you . " So they went out and got into the boat . That night they didn't catch anything .
43021004	Early in the morning , Jesus stood on the shore . But the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus .
43021005	He called out to them , " Friends , don't you have any fish ? " " No , " they answered .
43021006	He said , " Throw your net on the right side of the boat . There you will find some fish . " When they did , they could not pull the net into the boat . There were too many fish in it .
43021007	Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Simon Peter , " It is the Lord ! " As soon as Peter heard that , he put his coat on . He had taken it off earlier . Then he jumped into the water .
43021008	The other disciples followed in the boat . They were towing the net full of fish . The shore was only about 100 yards away .
43021009	When they landed , they saw a fire of burning coals . There were fish on it . There was also some bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , " Bring some of the fish you have just caught . "
43021011	Simon Peter climbed into the boat . He dragged the net to shore . It was full of large fish . There were 153 of them . But even with that many fish the net was not torn .
43021012	Jesus said to them , " Come and have breakfast . " None of the disciples dared to ask him , " Who are you ? " They knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came , took the bread and gave it to them . He did the same thing with the fish .
43021014	This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead .
43021015	When Jesus and the disciples had finished eating , Jesus spoke to Simon Peter . He asked , " Simon , son of John , do you really love me more than these others do ? " " Yes , Lord , " he answered . " You know that I love you . " Jesus said , " Feed my lambs . "
43021016	Again Jesus asked , " Simon , son of John , do you really love me ? " He answered , " Yes , Lord . You know that I love you . " Jesus said , " Take care of my sheep . "
43021017	Jesus spoke to him a third time . He asked , " Simon , son of John , do you love me ? " Peter felt bad because Jesus asked him the third time , " Do you love me ? " He answered , " Lord , you know all things . You know that I love you . " Jesus said , " Feed my sheep .
43021018	What I'm about to tell you is true . When you were younger , you dressed yourself . You went wherever you wanted to go . But when you are old , you will stretch out your hands . Someone else will dress you . Someone else will lead you where you do not want to go . "
43021019	Jesus said this to point out how Peter would die . His death would bring glory to God . Then Jesus said to him , " Follow me ! "
43021020	Peter turned around . He saw that the disciple Jesus loved was following them . He was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper . He had said , " Lord , who is going to hand you over to your enemies ? "
43021021	When Peter saw that disciple , he asked , " Lord , what will happen to him ? "
43021022	Jesus answered , " Suppose I want him to remain alive until I return . What does that matter to you ? You must follow me . "
43021023	Because of what Jesus said , a false report spread among the believers . The story was told that the disciple Jesus loved wouldn't die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He only said , " Suppose I want him to remain alive until I return . What does that matter to you ? "
43021024	This is the disciple who gives witness to these things . He also wrote them down . We know that his witness is true .
43021025	Jesus also did many other things . What if every one of them were written down ? I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written .
44001001	Theophilus , I wrote about Jesus in my earlier book . I wrote about all he did and taught
44001002	until the day he was taken up to heaven . Before Jesus left , he gave orders to the apostles he had chosen . He did this through the Holy Spirit .
44001003	After his suffering and death , he appeared to them . In many ways he proved that he was alive . He appeared to them over a period of 40 days . During that time he spoke about God's kingdom .
44001004	One day Jesus was eating with them . He gave them a command . " Do not leave Jerusalem , " he said . " Wait for the gift my Father promised . You have heard me talk about it .
44001005	John baptized with water . But in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . "
44001006	When the apostles met together , they asked Jesus a question . " Lord , " they said , " are you going to give the kingdom back to Israel now ? "
44001007	He said to them , " You should not be concerned about times or dates . The Father has set them by his own authority .
44001008	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you . Then you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem . You will be my witnesses in all Judea and Samaria . And you will be my witnesses from one end of the earth to the other . "
44001009	After Jesus said this , he was taken up to heaven . They watched until a cloud hid him from their sight .
44001010	While he was going up , they kept on looking at the sky . Suddenly two men dressed in white clothing stood beside them .
44001011	" Men of Galilee , " they said , " why do you stand here looking at the sky ? Jesus has been taken away from you into heaven . But he will come back in the same way you saw him go . "
44001012	The apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives . It is almost a mile from the city .
44001013	When they arrived , they went upstairs to the room where they were staying . Peter , John , James and Andrew were there . Philip , Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew were there too . So were James , son of Alphaeus , Simon the Zealot , and Judas , son of James .
44001014	They all came together regularly to pray . The women joined them too . So did Jesus' mother Mary and his brothers .
44001015	In those days Peter stood up among the believers . About 120 of them were there .
44001016	Peter said , " Brothers , a long time ago the Holy Spirit spoke through David's mouth about Judas . What he said in Scripture had to come true . Judas was the guide for the men who arrested Jesus .
44001017	But Judas was one of us . He shared with us in our work for God . "
44001018	Judas bought a field with the reward he got for the evil thing he had done . He fell down headfirst in the field . His body burst open . All his insides spilled out .
44001019	Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this . So they called that field Akeldama . In their language , Akeldama means The Field of Blood .
44001020	Peter said , " Here is what is written in the book of Psalms . It says , " ' May his home be deserted . May no one live in it . ' The Psalms also say , " ' Let someone else take his place as leader . '
44001021	So we need to choose someone to take his place . It will have to be a man who was with us the whole time the Lord Jesus lived among us .
44001022	That time began when John was baptizing . It ended when Jesus was taken up from us . The one we choose must join us in giving witness that Jesus rose from the dead . "
44001023	So they suggested two men . One was Joseph , who was called Barsabbas . He was also called Justus . The other man was Matthias .
44001024	Then they prayed . " Lord , " they said , " you know everyone's heart . Show us which of these two you have chosen .
44001025	Show us who should take the place of Judas as an apostle . He gave up being an apostle to go where he belongs . "
44001026	Then they cast lots . Matthias was chosen . So he was added to the 11 apostles .
44002001	The day of Pentecost came . The believers all gathered in one place .
44002002	Suddenly a sound came from heaven . It was like a strong wind blowing . It filled the whole house where they were sitting .
44002003	They saw something that looked like tongues of fire . The flames separated and settled on each of them .
44002004	All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit . They began to speak in languages they had not known before . The Spirit gave them the ability to do this .
44002005	Godly Jews from every country in the world were staying in Jerusalem .
44002006	A crowd came together when they heard the sound . They were bewildered because they each heard the believers speaking in their own language .
44002007	The crowd was really amazed . They asked , " Aren't all these people from Galilee ?
44002008	Why , then , do we each hear them speaking in our own native language ?
44002009	We are Parthians , Medes and Elamites . We live in Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia . We are from Pontus , Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia . Others of us are from Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene . Still others are visitors from Rome .
44002011	Some of the visitors are Jews . Others have accepted the Jewish faith . Also , Cretans and Arabs are here . We hear all these people speaking about God's wonders in our own languages ! "
44002012	They were amazed and bewildered . They asked one another , " What does this mean ? "
44002013	But some people in the crowd made fun of the believers . " They've had too much wine ! " they said .
44002014	Then Peter stood up with the Eleven . In a loud voice he spoke to the crowd . " My Jewish friends , " he said , " let me explain this to you . All of you who live in Jerusalem , listen carefully to what I say .
44002015	You think these people are drunk . But they aren't . It's only nine o'clock in the morning !
44002016	No , here is what the prophet Joel meant .
44002017	He said , " ' In the last days , God says , I will pour out my Holy Spirit on all people . Your sons and daughters will prophesy . Your young men will see visions . Your old men will have dreams .
44002018	In those days I will pour out my Spirit even on those who serve me , both men and women . When I do , they will prophesy .
44002019	I will show wonders in the heavens above . I will show miraculous signs on the earth below . There will be blood and fire and clouds of smoke .
44002020	The sun will become dark . The moon will turn red like blood . This will happen before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord .
44002021	Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . '
44002022	" Men of Israel , listen to this ! Jesus of Nazareth was a man who had God's approval . God did miracles , wonders and signs among you through Jesus . You yourselves know this .
44002023	Long ago God planned that Jesus would be handed over to you . With the help of evil people , you put Jesus to death . You nailed him to the cross .
44002024	But God raised him from the dead . He set him free from the suffering of death . It wasn't possible for death to keep its hold on Jesus .
44002025	David spoke about him . He said , " ' I know that the Lord is always with me . He is at my right hand . I will always be secure .
44002026	So my heart is glad . Joy is on my tongue . My body also will be full of hope .
44002027	You will not leave me in the grave . You will not let your Holy One rot away .
44002028	You always show me the path that leads to life . You will fill me with joy when I am with you . '
44002029	" Brothers , you can be sure that King David died . He was buried . His tomb is still here today .
44002030	But David was a prophet . He knew that God had made a promise to him . He had taken an oath that someone in David's family line would be king after him .
44002031	David saw what was ahead . So he spoke about the Christ rising from the dead . He said that the Christ would not be left in the grave . His body wouldn't rot in the ground .
44002032	God has raised this same Jesus back to life . We are all witnesses of this .
44002033	Jesus has been given a place of honor at the right hand of God . He has received the Holy Spirit from the Father . This is what God had promised . It is Jesus who has poured out what you now see and hear .
44002034	David did not go up to heaven . But he said , " ' The Lord said to my Lord , " Sit at my right hand .
44002035	I will put your enemies under your control . " '
44002036	" So be sure of this , all you people of Israel . You nailed Jesus to the cross . But God has made him both Lord and Christ . "
44002037	When the people heard this , their hearts were filled with shame . They said to Peter and the other apostles , " Brothers , what should we do ? "
44002038	Peter replied , " All of you must turn away from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then your sins will be forgiven . You will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	The promise is for you and your children . It is also for all who are far away . It is for all whom the Lord our God will choose . "
44002040	Peter said many other things to warn them . He begged them , " Save yourselves from these evil people . "
44002041	Those who accepted his message were baptized . About 3,000 people joined the believers that day .
44002042	The believers studied what the apostles taught . They shared life together . They broke bread and ate together . And they prayed .
44002043	Everyone felt that God was near . The apostles did many wonders and miraculous signs .
44002044	All the believers were together . They shared everything they had .
44002045	They sold what they owned . They gave each other everything they needed .
44002046	Every day they met together in the temple courtyard . In their homes they broke bread and ate together . Their hearts were glad and honest and true .
44002047	They praised God . They were respected by all the people . Every day the Lord added to their group those who were being saved .
44003001	One day Peter and John were going up to the temple . It was three o'clock in the afternoon . It was the time for prayer .
44003002	A man unable to walk was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful . He had been that way since he was born . Every day someone put him near the gate . There he would beg from people going into the temple courtyards .
44003003	He saw that Peter and John were about to enter . So he asked them for money .
44003004	Peter looked straight at him , and so did John . Then Peter said , " Look at us ! "
44003005	So the man watched them closely . He expected to get something from them .
44003006	Peter said , " I don't have any silver or gold . But I'll give you what I have . In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , get up and walk . "
44003007	Then Peter took him by the right hand and helped him up . At once the man's feet and ankles became strong .
44003008	He jumped to his feet and began to walk . He went with Peter and John into the temple courtyards . He walked and jumped and praised God .
44003009	All the people saw him walking and praising God .
44003010	They recognized him as the same man who used to sit and beg at the temple gate called Beautiful . They were filled with wonder . They were amazed at what had happened to him .
44003011	The beggar was holding on to Peter and John . All the people were amazed . They came running to them at Solomon's Porch .
44003012	When Peter saw this , he said , " Men of Israel , why does this surprise you ? Why do you stare at us ? We haven't made this man walk by our own power or godliness .
44003013	The God of our fathers , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , has done this . He has brought glory to Jesus , who serves him . But you handed Jesus over to be killed . Pilate had decided to let him go . But you spoke against Jesus when he was in Pilate's court .
44003014	You spoke against the Holy and Blameless One . You asked for a murderer to be set free instead .
44003015	You killed the one who gives life . But God raised him from the dead . We are witnesses of this .
44003016	This man whom you see and know was made strong because of faith in Jesus' name . Faith in Jesus has healed him completely . You can see it with your own eyes .
44003017	" My friends , I know you didn't realize what you were doing . Neither did your leaders .
44003018	But God had given a promise through all the prophets . And this is how he has made his promise come true . He said that his Christ would suffer .
44003019	So turn away from your sins . Turn to God . Then your sins will be wiped away . The time will come when the Lord will make everything new .
44003020	He will send the Christ . Jesus has been appointed as the Christ for you .
44003021	He must remain in heaven until the time when God makes everything new . He promised this long ago through his holy prophets .
44003022	Moses said , ' The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me . He will be one of your own people . You must listen to everything he tells you .
44003023	Those who do not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people . '
44003024	" Samuel and all the prophets after him spoke about this . They said these days would come .
44003025	What the prophets said was meant for you . The covenant God made with your people long ago is yours also . He said to Abraham , ' All nations on earth will be blessed through your children . '
44003026	God raised up Jesus , who serves him . God sent him first to you . He did it to bless you . He wanted to turn each of you from your evil ways . "
44004001	Peter and John were speaking to the people . The priests , the captain of the temple guard , and the Sadducees came up to the apostles .
44004002	They were very upset by what the apostles were teaching the people . The apostles were saying that because Jesus rose from the dead , people can be raised from the dead .
44004003	So the temple authorities arrested Peter and John . It was already evening , so they put them in prison until the next day .
44004004	But many who heard the message believed . The number of men who believed grew to about 5,000 .
44004005	The next day the rulers , the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem .
44004006	Annas , the high priest , was there . So were Caiaphas , John , Alexander and others in the high priest's family .
44004007	They had Peter and John brought to them . They wanted to question them . " By what power did you do this ? " they asked . " And through whose name ? "
44004008	Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit . He said to them , " Rulers and elders of the people !
44004009	Are you asking us to explain our actions today ? Do you want to know why we were kind to a disabled man ? Are you asking how he was healed ?
44004010	Then listen to this , you and all the people of Israel ! You nailed Jesus Christ of Nazareth to the cross . But God raised him from the dead . It is through Jesus' name that this man stands healed in front of you .
44004011	Scripture says that Jesus is " ' the stone you builders did not accept . But it has become the most important stone of all . '
44004012	You can't be saved by believing in anyone else . God has given us no other name under heaven that will save us . "
44004013	The leaders saw how bold Peter and John were . They also realized that Peter and John were ordinary men with no training . This surprised the leaders . They realized that these men had been with Jesus .
44004014	The leaders could see the man who had been healed standing there with them . So there was nothing they could say .
44004015	They ordered Peter and John to leave the Sanhedrin . Then they talked things over .
44004016	" What can we do with these men ? " they asked . " Everybody in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle . We can't say it didn't happen .
44004017	We have to stop this thing . It must not spread any further among the people . We have to warn these men . They must never speak to anyone in Jesus' name again . "
44004018	Once again the leaders called in Peter and John . They commanded them not to speak or teach at all in Jesus' name .
44004019	But Peter and John replied , " Judge for yourselves . Which is right from God's point of view ? Should we obey you ? Or God ?
44004020	There's nothing else we can do . We have to speak about the things we've seen and heard . "
44004021	The leaders warned them again . Then they let them go . They couldn't decide how to punish Peter and John . They knew that all the people were praising God for what had happened .
44004022	The man who had been healed by the miracle was over 40 years old .
44004023	Peter and John were allowed to leave . They went back to their own people . They reported everything the chief priests and the elders had said to them .
44004024	When the believers heard this , they raised their voices together in prayer to God . " Lord and King , " they said , " you made the heavens , the earth and the sea . You made everything in them .
44004025	Long ago you spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David , who served you . You said , " ' Why are the nations angry ? Why do the people make useless plans ?
44004026	The kings of the earth take their stand against the Lord . The rulers of the earth gather together against his Anointed King . '
44004027	" In fact , Herod and Pontius Pilate met together in this city with those who weren't Jews . They also met with the people of Israel . All of them made plans against your holy servant Jesus . He is the one you anointed .
44004028	They did what your power and purpose had already decided should happen .
44004029	Now , Lord , consider the bad things they say they are going to do . Help us to be very bold when we speak your word .
44004030	Stretch out your hand to heal . Do miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus . "
44004031	After they prayed , the place where they were meeting was shaken . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit . They were bold when they spoke God's word .
44004032	All the believers were agreed in heart and mind . They didn't claim that anything they had was their own . They shared everything they owned .
44004033	With great power the apostles continued their teaching . They gave witness that the Lord Jesus had risen from the dead . And they were greatly blessed by God .
44004034	There were no needy persons among them . From time to time , those who owned land or houses sold them . They brought the money from the sales .
44004035	They put it down at the apostles' feet . It was then given out to anyone who needed it .
44004036	Joseph was a Levite from Cyprus . The apostles called him Barnabas . The name Barnabas means Son of Help .
44004037	Barnabas sold a field he owned . He brought the money from the sale . He put it down at the apostles' feet .
44005001	A man named Ananias and his wife , Sapphira , also sold some land .
44005002	He kept part of the money for himself . Sapphira knew he had kept it . He brought the rest of it and put it down at the apostles' feet .
44005003	Then Peter said , " Ananias , why did you let Satan fill your heart ? He made you lie to the Holy Spirit . You have kept some of the money you received for the land .
44005004	Didn't the land belong to you before it was sold ? After it was sold , you could have used the money as you wished . What made you think of doing such a thing ? You haven't lied to just anyone . You've lied to God . "
44005005	When Ananias heard this , he fell down and died . All who heard what had happened were filled with fear .
44005006	Some young men came and wrapped up his body . They carried him out and buried him .
44005007	About three hours later , the wife of Ananias came in . She didn't know what had happened .
44005008	Peter asked her , " Tell me . Is this the price you and Ananias sold the land for ? " " Yes , " she said . " That's the price . "
44005009	Peter asked her , " How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Listen ! You can hear the steps of the men who buried your husband . They are at the door . They will carry you out also . "
44005010	At that very moment she fell down at his feet and died . Then the young men came in . They saw that Sapphira was dead . So they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	The whole church and all who heard about these things were filled with fear .
44005012	The apostles did many miraculous signs and wonders among the people . All the believers used to meet together at Solomon's Porch .
44005013	No outsider dared to join them . But the people thought highly of them .
44005014	More and more men and women believed in the Lord . They joined the other believers .
44005015	So people brought those who were sick into the streets . They placed them on beds and mats . They hoped that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he walked by .
44005016	Crowds even gathered from the towns around Jerusalem . They brought their sick . They also brought those who were suffering because of evil spirits . All of them were healed .
44005017	The high priest and all his companions were Sadducees . They were very jealous of the apostles .
44005018	So they arrested them and put them in the public prison .
44005019	But during the night an angel of the Lord came . He opened the prison doors and brought the apostles out .
44005020	" Go ! Stand in the temple courtyard , " the angel said . " Tell the people all about this new life . "
44005021	Early the next day they did as they had been told . They entered the temple courtyard . There they began to teach the people . The high priest and his companions arrived . They called the Sanhedrin together . The Sanhedrin was a gathering of all the elders of Israel . They sent for the apostles who were in prison .
44005022	The officers arrived at the prison . But they didn't find the apostles there . So they went back and reported it .
44005023	" We found the prison locked up tight , " they said . " The guards were standing at the doors . But when we opened the doors , we didn't find anyone inside . "
44005024	When the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this report , they were bewildered . They wondered what would happen next .
44005025	Then someone came and said , " Look ! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple courtyard . They are teaching the people . "
44005026	So the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles back . But they didn't use force . They were afraid the people would kill them by throwing stones at them .
44005027	They brought the apostles to be judged by the Sanhedrin . The high priest questioned them .
44005028	" We gave you clear orders not to teach in Jesus' name , " he said . " But you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching . You want to make us guilty of this man's death . "
44005029	Peter and the other apostles replied , " We must obey God instead of people !
44005030	You had Jesus killed by nailing him to a cross . But the God of our people raised Jesus from the dead .
44005031	Now Jesus is Prince and Savior . God has proved this by giving him a place of honor at his own right hand . He did it so that he could turn Israel away from their sins and forgive them .
44005032	We are witnesses of these things . And so is the Holy Spirit . God has given the Spirit to those who obey him . "
44005033	When the leaders heard this , they became very angry . They wanted to put the apostles to death .
44005034	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel stood up in the Sanhedrin . He was a teacher of the law . He was honored by all the people . He ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while .
44005035	Then he spoke to the Sanhedrin . " Men of Israel , " he said , " think carefully about what you plan to do to these men .
44005036	Some time ago Theudas appeared . He claimed he was really somebody . About 400 people followed him . But he was killed . All his followers were scattered . So they accomplished nothing .
44005037	After this , Judas from Galilee came along . This was in the days when the Romans made a list of all the people . Judas led a gang of men against the Romans . He too was killed . All his followers were scattered .
44005038	So let me give you some advice . Leave these men alone ! Let them go ! If their plans and actions are only human , they will fail .
44005039	But if their plans come from God , you won't be able to stop these men . You will only find yourselves fighting against God . "
44005040	His speech won the leaders over . They called the apostles in and had them whipped . The leaders ordered them not to speak in Jesus' name . Then they let the apostles go .
44005041	The apostles were full of joy as they left the Sanhedrin . They considered it an honor to suffer shame for the name of Jesus .
44005042	Day after day , they kept teaching in the temple courtyards and from house to house . They never stopped telling the good news that Jesus is the Christ .
44006001	In those days the number of believers was growing . The Jews who followed Greek practices complained against the Jews who followed only Jewish practices . They said that the widows of men who followed Greek practices were not being taken care of . They weren't getting their fair share of food each day .
44006002	So the Twelve gathered all the believers together . They said , " It wouldn't be right for us to give up teaching God's word in order to wait on tables .
44006003	Brothers , choose seven of your men . They must be known as men who are wise and full of the Holy Spirit . We will turn this important work over to them .
44006004	Then we can give our attention to prayer and to teaching the word . "
44006005	This plan pleased the whole group . They chose Stephen . He was full of faith and of the Holy Spirit . Philip , Procorus , Nicanor , Timon and Parmenas were chosen too . The group also chose Nicolas from Antioch . He had accepted the Jewish faith .
44006006	The group brought them to the apostles . Then the apostles prayed and placed their hands on them .
44006007	So God's word spread . The number of believers in Jerusalem grew quickly . Also , a large number of priests began to obey Jesus' teachings .
44006008	Stephen was full of God's grace and power . He did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people .
44006009	But members of the group called the Synagogue of the Freedmen began to oppose him . Some of them were Jews from Cyrene and Alexandria . Others were Jews from Cilicia and Asia Minor . They all began to argue with Stephen .
44006010	But he was too wise for them . They couldn't stand up against the Holy Spirit who spoke through him .
44006011	Then in secret they talked some men into lying about Stephen . They said , " We heard Stephen speak evil things against Moses . He also spoke evil things against God . "
44006012	So the people were stirred up . The elders and the teachers of the law were stirred up too . They arrested Stephen and brought him to the Sanhedrin .
44006013	They found people who were willing to tell lies . The false witnesses said , " This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place . He also speaks against the law .
44006014	We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place . He says Jesus will change the practices that Moses handed down to us . "
44006015	All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked right at Stephen . They saw that his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	Then the high priest questioned Stephen . " Is what these people are saying true ? " he asked .
44007002	" Brothers and fathers , listen to me ! " Stephen replied . " The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham . At that time Abraham was still in Mesopotamia . He had not yet begun living in Haran .
44007003	' Leave your country and your people , ' God said . ' Go to the land I will show you . '
44007004	" So Abraham left the land of Babylonia . He settled in Haran . After his father died , God sent Abraham to this land where you are now living .
44007005	God didn't give him any property here . He didn't give him even a foot of land . But God made a promise to him and to all his family after him . He said they would possess the land . The promise was made even though at that time Abraham had no child .
44007006	" Here is what God said to him . ' Your family after you will be strangers in a country that is not their own . They will be slaves and will be treated badly for 400 years .
44007007	But I will punish the nation that makes them slaves , ' God said . ' After that , they will leave that country and worship me here . '
44007008	" Then God made a covenant with Abraham . God told him that circumcision would show who the members of the covenant were . Abraham became Isaac's father . He circumcised Isaac eight days after he was born . Later , Isaac became Jacob's father . Jacob had 12 sons . They became the founders of the 12 tribes of Israel .
44007009	" Jacob's sons were jealous of their brother Joseph . So they sold him as a slave . He was taken to Egypt . But God was with him .
44007010	He saved Joseph from all his troubles . God made Joseph wise . He helped him to become the friend of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . So Pharaoh made Joseph ruler over Egypt and his whole palace .
44007011	" There was not enough food for all Egypt and Canaan . This brought great suffering . Jacob and his sons couldn't find food .
44007012	But Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt . So he sent his sons on their first visit .
44007013	On their second visit , Joseph told his brothers who he was . Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family .
44007014	" After this , Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family . The total number of people was 75 .
44007015	Then Jacob went down to Egypt . There he and his family died .
44007016	Some of their bodies were brought back to Shechem . They were placed in a tomb Abraham had bought . He had purchased it from Hamor's sons at Shechem for a certain amount of money .
44007017	" In Egypt the number of our people grew and grew . It was nearly time for God to make his promise to Abraham come true .
44007018	Another king became ruler of Egypt . He knew nothing about Joseph .
44007019	He was very evil and dishonest with our people . He beat them down . He forced them to throw out their newborn babies to die .
44007020	" At that time Moses was born . He was not an ordinary child . For three months he was taken care of by his family .
44007021	Then he was placed outside . But Pharaoh's daughter took him home . She brought him up as her own son .
44007022	Moses was taught all the knowledge of the people of Egypt . He became a powerful speaker and a man of action .
44007023	" When Moses was 40 years old , he decided to visit the people of Israel . They were his own people .
44007024	He saw one of them being treated badly by a man of Egypt . So he went to help him . He got even by killing the man .
44007025	Moses thought his own people would realize that God was using him to save them . But they didn't .
44007026	" The next day Moses saw two men of Israel fighting . He tried to make peace between them . ' Men , you are both of Israel , ' he said . ' Why do you want to hurt each other ? '
44007027	" But the man who was treating the other one badly pushed Moses to one side . He said , ' Who made you ruler and judge over us ?
44007028	Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? '
44007029	When Moses heard this , he escaped to Midian . He lived there as a stranger . He became the father of two sons there .
44007030	" Forty years passed . Then an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush . This happened in the desert near Mount Sinai .
44007031	When Moses saw the bush , he was amazed . He went over for a closer look . There he heard the Lord's voice .
44007032	' I am the God of your fathers , ' the Lord said . ' I am the God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . ' Moses shook with fear . He didn't dare to look .
44007033	" Then the Lord said to him , ' Take off your sandals . The place you are standing on is holy ground .
44007034	I have seen my people beaten down in Egypt . I have heard their groans . I have come down to set them free . Now come . I will send you back to Egypt . '
44007035	" This is the same Moses the two men of Israel would not accept . They had said , ' Who made you ruler and judge ? ' But God himself sent Moses to rule the people of Israel and set them free . He spoke to Moses through the angel who had appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	So Moses led them out of Egypt . He did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt , at the Red Sea , and for 40 years in the desert .
44007037	" This is the same Moses who spoke to the people of Israel . ' God will send you a prophet , ' he said . ' He will be like me . He will come from your own people . '
44007038	Moses was with the Israelites in the desert . He was with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai . Moses was with our people of long ago . He received living words to pass on to us .
44007039	" But our people refused to obey Moses . They would not accept him . In their hearts , they wished they were back in Egypt .
44007040	They told Aaron , ' Make us a god who will lead us . This fellow Moses led us out of Egypt . But we don't know what has happened to him ! '
44007041	That was the time they made a statue to be their god . It looked like a calf . They brought sacrifices to it . They were glad because of what they had made with their own hands .
44007042	But God turned away from them . He left them to worship the sun , moon and stars . This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets . There it says , " ' People of Israel , did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for 40 years in the desert ?
44007043	You lifted up the place where Molech was worshiped . You lifted up the star of your god Rephan . You made statues of them to worship . So I will send you away from your country . ' God sent them to Babylon and even farther .
44007044	" Long ago our people had with them in the desert the holy tent where the tablets of the covenant were kept . Moses had made the holy tent as God had commanded him . It was made like the pattern he had seen .
44007045	Our people received the tent from God . They brought it with them when they took the land of Canaan . God drove out the nations that were in their way . At that time Joshua was Israel's leader . " The tent remained in the land until David's time .
44007046	David was blessed by God . So David asked if he could build a house for the God of Jacob .
44007047	Instead , it was Solomon who built it for him .
44007048	" But the Most High God does not live in houses made by human hands . As God says through the prophet ,
44007049	" ' Heaven is my throne . The earth is under my control . What kind of house will you build for me ? says the Lord . Where will my resting place be ?
44007050	Didn't my hand make all these things ? '
44007051	" You people ! You won't obey ! You are stubborn ! You won't listen ! You are just like your people of long ago ! You always oppose the Holy Spirit !
44007052	Was there ever a prophet your people didn't try to hurt ? They even killed those who told about the coming of the Blameless One . And now you have handed him over to his enemies . You have murdered him .
44007053	The law you received was brought by angels . But you haven't obeyed it . "
44007054	When the Sanhedrin heard this , they became very angry . They ground their teeth at Stephen .
44007055	But he was full of the Holy Spirit . He looked up to heaven and saw God's glory . He saw Jesus standing at God's right hand .
44007056	" Look ! " he said . " I see heaven open . The Son of Man is standing at God's right hand . "
44007057	When the Sanhedrin heard this , they covered their ears . They yelled at the top of their voices . They all rushed at him .
44007058	They dragged him out of the city . They began to throw stones at him to kill him . The witnesses took off their coats . They placed them at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	While the members of the Sanhedrin were throwing stones at Stephen , he prayed . " Lord Jesus , receive my spirit , " he said .
44007060	Then he fell on his knees . He cried out , " Lord ! Don't hold this sin against them ! " When he had said this , he died .
44008001	Saul was there . He had agreed that Stephen should die . On that day the church in Jerusalem began to be attacked and treated badly . All except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria .
44008002	Godly Jews buried Stephen . They sobbed and sobbed over him .
44008003	But Saul began to destroy the church . He went from house to house . He dragged men and women away and put them in prison .
44008004	The believers who had been scattered preached the word everywhere they went .
44008005	Philip went down to a city in Samaria . There he preached about the Christ .
44008006	The crowds listened to Philip . They saw the miraculous signs he did . They all paid close attention to what he said .
44008007	Evil spirits screamed and came out of many people . Many who were disabled or who couldn't walk were healed .
44008008	So there was great joy in that city .
44008009	A man named Simon lived in the city . For quite a while he had practiced evil magic there . He amazed all the people of Samaria . He claimed to be someone great .
44008010	All of the people listened to him , from the least important of them to the most important . They exclaimed , " This man is known as the Great Power of God ! "
44008011	He had amazed them for a long time with his magic . So they followed him .
44008012	But Philip preached the good news of God's kingdom . He preached the name of Jesus Christ . So men and women believed and were baptized .
44008013	Simon himself believed and was baptized . He followed Philip everywhere . He was amazed by the great signs and miracles he saw .
44008014	The apostles in Jerusalem heard that people in Samaria had accepted God's word . So they sent Peter and John to them .
44008015	When they arrived there , they prayed that the believers would receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	The Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them . They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then Peter and John placed their hands on them . And they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Simon watched as the apostles placed their hands on them . He saw that the Spirit was given to them . So he offered money to Peter and John .
44008019	He said , " Give me this power too . Then everyone I place my hands on will receive the Holy Spirit . "
44008020	Peter answered , " May your money be destroyed with you ! Do you think you can buy God's gift with money ?
44008021	You have no part or share in this holy work . Your heart is not right with God .
44008022	Turn away from this evil sin of yours . Pray to the Lord . Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart .
44008023	I see that you are very bitter . You are a prisoner of sin . "
44008024	Then Simon answered , " Pray to the Lord for me . Pray that nothing you have said will happen to me . "
44008025	Peter and John gave witness and preached the Lord's word . Then they returned to Jerusalem . On the way they preached the good news in many villages in Samaria .
44008026	An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip . " Go south to the desert road , " he said . " It's the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . "
44008027	So Philip started out . On his way he met an Ethiopian official . The man had an important position . He was in charge of all the wealth of Candace . She was the queen of Ethiopia . He had gone to Jerusalem to worship .
44008028	On his way home he was sitting in his chariot . He was reading the book of Isaiah the prophet .
44008029	The Holy Spirit told Philip , " Go to that chariot . Stay near it . "
44008030	So Philip ran up to the chariot . He heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet . " Do you understand what you're reading ? " Philip asked .
44008031	" How can I ? " he said . " I need someone to explain it to me . " So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him .
44008032	Here is the part of Scripture the official was reading . It says , " He was led like a sheep to be killed . Just as lambs are silent while their wool is being cut off , he did not open his mouth .
44008033	When he was treated badly , he was refused a fair trial . Who can say anything about his children ? His life was cut off from the earth . "
44008034	The official said to Philip , " Tell me , please . Who is the prophet talking about ? Himself , or someone else ? "
44008035	Then Philip began with that same part of Scripture . He told him the good news about Jesus .
44008038	He gave orders to stop the chariot . Then both Philip and the official went down into the water . Philip baptized him .
44008039	When they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away . The official did not see him again . He went on his way full of joy .
44008040	Philip was seen next at Azotus . From there he traveled all around . He preached the good news in all the towns . Finally he arrived in Caesarea .
44009001	Meanwhile , Saul continued to oppose the Lord's followers . He said they would be put to death . He went to the high priest .
44009002	He asked the priest for letters to the synagogues in Damascus . He wanted to find men and women who belonged to the Way of Jesus . The letters would allow him to take them as prisoners to Jerusalem .
44009003	On his journey , Saul approached Damascus . Suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him .
44009004	He fell to the ground . He heard a voice speak to him . " Saul ! Saul ! " the voice said . " Why are you opposing me ? "
44009005	" Who are you , Lord ? " Saul asked . " I am Jesus , " he replied . " I am the one you are opposing .
44009006	Now get up and go into the city . There you will be told what you must do . "
44009007	The men traveling with Saul stood there . They weren't able to speak . They had heard the sound . But they didn't see anyone .
44009008	Saul got up from the ground . He opened his eyes , but he couldn't see . So they led him by the hand into Damascus .
44009009	For three days he was blind . He didn't eat or drink anything .
44009010	In Damascus there was a believer named Ananias . The Lord called out to him in a vision . " Ananias ! " he said . " Yes , Lord , " he answered .
44009011	The Lord told him , " Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street . Ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul . He is praying .
44009012	In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias . The man has come and placed his hands on him . Now he will be able to see again . "
44009013	" Lord , " Ananias answered , " I've heard many reports about this man . They say he has done great harm to God's people in Jerusalem .
44009014	Now he has come here to arrest all those who worship you . The chief priests have given him authority to do this . "
44009015	But the Lord said to Ananias , " Go ! I have chosen this man to work for me . He will carry my name to those who aren't Jews and to their kings . He will bring my name to the people of Israel .
44009016	I will show him how much he must suffer for me . "
44009017	Then Ananias went to the house and entered it . He placed his hands on Saul . " Brother Saul , " he said , " you saw the Lord Jesus . He appeared to you on the road as you were coming here . He has sent me so that you will be able to see again . You will be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
44009018	Right away something like scales fell from Saul's eyes . And he could see again . He got up and was baptized .
44009019	After eating some food , he got his strength back . Saul spent several days with the believers in Damascus .
44009020	At once he began to preach in the synagogues . He taught that Jesus is the Son of God .
44009021	All who heard him were amazed . They asked , " Isn't he the man who caused great trouble in Jerusalem for those who worship Jesus ? Hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests ? "
44009022	But Saul grew more and more powerful . The Jews living in Damascus couldn't believe what was happening . Saul proved to them that Jesus is the Christ .
44009023	After many days , the Jews had a meeting . They planned to kill Saul .
44009024	But he learned about their plan . Day and night they watched the city gates closely in order to kill him .
44009025	But his followers helped him escape by night . They lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall .
44009026	When Saul came to Jerusalem , he tried to join the believers . But they were all afraid of him . They didn't believe he was really one of Jesus' followers .
44009027	But Barnabas took him to the apostles . He told them about Saul's journey . He said that Saul had seen the Lord . He told how the Lord had spoken to Saul . Barnabas also said that Saul had preached without fear in Jesus' name in Damascus .
44009028	So Saul stayed with the believers . He moved about freely in Jerusalem . He spoke boldly in the Lord's name .
44009029	He talked and argued with Jews who followed Greek practices . But they tried to kill him .
44009030	The other believers heard about this . They took Saul down to Caesarea . From there they sent him off to Tarsus .
44009031	Then the church throughout Judea , Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace . The Holy Spirit gave the church strength and boldness . So they grew in numbers . And they worshiped the Lord .
44009032	As Peter traveled around the country , he went to visit God's people in Lydda .
44009033	There he found a disabled man named Aeneas . For eight years the man had spent most of his time in bed .
44009034	" Aeneas , " Peter said to him , " Jesus Christ heals you . Get up ! Take care of your mat ! " So Aeneas got up right away .
44009035	Everyone who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him . They turned to the Lord .
44009036	In Joppa there was a believer named Tabitha . Her name in the Greek language was Dorcas . She was always doing good and helping poor people .
44009037	About that time she became sick and died . Her body was washed and placed in a room upstairs .
44009038	Lydda was near Joppa . The believers heard that Peter was in Lydda . So they sent two men to him . They begged him , " Please come at once ! "
44009039	Peter went with them . When he arrived , he was taken upstairs to the room . All the widows stood around him crying . They showed him the robes and other clothes Dorcas had made while she was still alive .
44009040	Peter sent them all out of the room . Then he got down on his knees and prayed . He turned toward the dead woman . He said , " Tabitha , get up . " She opened her eyes . When she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet . Then he called the believers and the widows . He brought her to them . They saw that she was alive .
44009042	This became known all over Joppa . Many people believed in the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed in Joppa for some time . He stayed with Simon , a man who worked with leather .
44010001	A man named Cornelius lived in Caesarea . He was a Roman commander in the Italian Regiment .
44010002	Cornelius and all his family were faithful and worshiped God . He gave freely to people who were in need . He prayed to God regularly .
44010003	One day about three o'clock in the afternoon he had a vision . He saw an angel of God clearly . The angel came to him and said , " Cornelius ! "
44010004	Cornelius was afraid . He stared at the angel . " What is it , Lord ? " he asked . The angel answered , " Your prayers and gifts to poor people have come up like an offering to God . So he has remembered you .
44010005	Now send men to Joppa . Have them bring back a man named Simon . He is also called Peter .
44010006	He is staying with another Simon , a man who works with leather . His house is by the sea . "
44010007	The angel who spoke to him left . Then Cornelius called two of his servants . He also called a godly soldier who was one of his attendants .
44010008	He told them everything that had happened . Then he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	It was about noon the next day . The men were on their journey and were approaching the city . Peter went up on the roof to pray .
44010010	He became hungry . He wanted something to eat . While the meal was being prepared , Peter had a vision .
44010011	He saw heaven open up . There he saw something that looked like a large sheet . It was being let down to earth by its four corners .
44010012	It had all kinds of four-footed animals in it . It also had reptiles of the earth and birds of the air .
44010013	Then a voice told him , " Get up , Peter . Kill and eat . "
44010014	" No , Lord ! I will not ! " Peter replied . " I have never eaten anything that is not pure and ' clean . ' "
44010015	The voice spoke to him a second time . " Do not say anything is not pure that God has made ' clean , ' " it said .
44010016	This happened three times . Right away the sheet was taken back up to heaven .
44010017	Peter was wondering what the vision meant . At that very moment the men sent by Cornelius found Simon's house . They stopped at the gate
44010018	and called out . They asked if Simon Peter was staying there .
44010019	Peter was still thinking about the vision . The Holy Spirit spoke to him . " Simon , " he said , " three men are looking for you .
44010020	Get up and go downstairs . Don't let anything keep you from going with them . I have sent them . "
44010021	Peter went down and spoke to the men . " I'm the one you're looking for , " he said . " Why have you come ? "
44010022	The men replied , " We have come from Cornelius , the Roman commander . He is a good man who worships God . All the Jewish people respect him . A holy angel told him to invite you to his house . Cornelius wants to hear what you have to say . "
44010023	Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests . The next day Peter went with the three men . Some of the believers from Joppa went along .
44010024	The following day he arrived in Caesarea . Cornelius was expecting them . He had called together his relatives and close friends .
44010025	When Peter entered the house , Cornelius met him . As a sign of respect , he fell at Peter's feet .
44010026	But Peter made him get up . " Stand up , " he said . " I am only a man myself . "
44010027	Talking with Cornelius , Peter went inside . There he found a large group of people .
44010028	He said to them , " You know that it is against our law for a Jew to have anything to do with those who aren't Jews . But God has shown me that I should not say anyone is not pure and ' clean . '
44010029	So when you sent for me , I came without asking any questions . May I ask why you sent for me ? "
44010030	Cornelius answered , " Four days ago at this very hour I was in my house praying . It was three o'clock in the afternoon . Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood in front of me .
44010031	He said , ' Cornelius , God has heard your prayer . He has remembered your gifts to poor people .
44010032	Send someone to Joppa to get Simon Peter . He is a guest in the home of another Simon , who works with leather . He lives by the sea . '
44010033	So I sent for you right away . It was good of you to come . Now we are all here . And God is here with us . We are ready to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us . "
44010034	Then Peter began to speak . " I now realize how true it is that God treats everyone the same , " he said .
44010035	" He accepts people from every nation . He accepts all who have respect for him and do what is right .
44010036	" You know the message God sent to the people of Israel . It is the good news of peace through Jesus Christ . He is Lord of all .
44010037	You know what has happened all through Judea . It started in Galilee after John preached about baptism .
44010038	You know how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power . Jesus went around doing good . He healed all who were under the devil's power . God was with him .
44010039	" We are witnesses of everything he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem . They killed him by nailing him to a cross .
44010040	But on the third day God raised him from the dead . God allowed Jesus to be seen .
44010041	But he wasn't seen by all the people . He was seen only by us . We are witnesses whom God had already chosen . We ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
44010042	" He commanded us to preach to the people . He told us to give witness that he is the one appointed by God to judge the living and the dead .
44010043	All the prophets give witness about him . They say that all who believe in him have their sins forgiven through his name . "
44010044	While Peter was still saying these things , the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message .
44010045	Some Jewish believers had come with Peter . They were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on those who weren't Jews .
44010046	They heard them speaking in languages they had not known before . They also heard them praising God . Then Peter said ,
44010047	" Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water ? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have . "
44010048	So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days .
44011001	The apostles and the believers all through Judea heard that people who were not Jews had also received God's word .
44011002	Peter went up to Jerusalem . There the Jewish believers found fault with him .
44011003	They said , " You went into the house of those who aren't Jews . You ate with them . "
44011004	Peter explained everything to them . He told them exactly what had happened .
44011005	" I was in the city of Joppa praying , " he said . " There I had a vision . I saw something that looked like a large sheet . It was being let down from heaven by its four corners . It came down to where I was .
44011006	I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth . There were also wild animals , reptiles and birds .
44011007	Then I heard a voice speaking to me . ' Get up , Peter , ' the voice said . ' Kill and eat . '
44011008	" I replied , ' No , Lord ! I will not ! Nothing that is not pure and " clean " has ever entered my mouth . '
44011009	" A second time the voice spoke from heaven . ' Do not say anything is not pure that God has made " clean , " ' the voice said .
44011010	This happened three times . Then the sheet was pulled up into heaven .
44011011	" Just then three men stopped at the house where I was staying . They had been sent to me from Caesarea .
44011012	The Holy Spirit told me not to let anything keep me from going with them . These six brothers here went with me . We entered the man's house .
44011013	He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house . The angel said , ' Send to Joppa for Simon Peter .
44011014	He has a message to bring to you . You and your whole family will be saved through it . '
44011015	" As I began to speak , the Holy Spirit came on them . He came just as he had come on us at the beginning .
44011016	Then I remembered the Lord's words . ' John baptized with water , ' he had said . ' But you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . '
44011017	God gave them the same gift he gave those of us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ . So who was I to think that I could oppose God ? "
44011018	When they heard this , they didn't object anymore . They praised God . They said , " So then , God has allowed even those who aren't Jews to turn away from their sins and live . "
44011019	Some believers had been scattered by the suffering that came to them after Stephen's death . They traveled as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus and Antioch . But they told the message only to Jews .
44011020	Some believers from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch . There they began to speak to Greeks also . They told them the good news about the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The Lord's power was with them . Large numbers of people believed and turned to the Lord .
44011022	The church in Jerusalem heard about this . So they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done , he was glad . He told them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts .
44011024	Barnabas was a good man . He was full of the Holy Spirit and of faith . Large numbers of people came to know the Lord .
44011025	Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul .
44011026	He found him there . Then he brought him to Antioch . For a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church . They taught large numbers of people . At Antioch the believers were called Christians for the first time .
44011027	In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them was named Agabus . He stood up and spoke through the Spirit . He said there would not be nearly enough food anywhere in the Roman world . This happened while Claudius was the emperor .
44011029	The believers decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea . All of them helped as much as they could .
44011030	They sent their gift to the elders through Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	About this time , King Herod arrested some people who belonged to the church . He planned to make them suffer greatly .
44012002	He had James killed with a sword . James was John's brother .
44012003	Herod saw that the death of James pleased the Jews . So he arrested Peter also . This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread .
44012004	After Herod arrested Peter , he put him in prison . Peter was placed under guard . He was watched by four groups of four soldiers each . Herod planned to put Peter on public trial . It would take place after the Passover Feast .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison . But the church prayed hard to God for him .
44012006	It was the night before Herod was going to bring him to trial . Peter was sleeping between two soldiers . Two chains held him there . Lookouts stood guard at the entrance .
44012007	Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared . A light shone in the prison cell . The angel struck Peter on his side . Peter woke up . " Quick ! " the angel said . " Get up ! " The chains fell off Peter's wrists .
44012008	Then the angel said to him , " Put on your clothes and sandals . " Peter did so . " Put on your coat , " the angel told him . " Follow me . "
44012009	Peter followed him out of the prison . But he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening . He thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	They passed the first and second guards . Then they came to the iron gate leading to the city . It opened for them by itself . They went through it . They walked the length of one street . Suddenly the angel left Peter .
44012011	Then Peter realized what had happened . He said , " Now I know for sure that the Lord sent his angel . He set me free from Herod's power . He saved me from everything the Jewish people were hoping for . "
44012012	When Peter understood what had happened , he went to Mary's house . Mary was the mother of John Mark . Many people had gathered in her home . They were praying there .
44012013	Peter knocked at the outer entrance . A servant named Rhoda came to answer the door .
44012014	She recognized Peter's voice . She was so excited that she ran back without opening the door . " Peter is at the door ! " she exclaimed .
44012015	" You're out of your mind , " they said to her . But she kept telling them it was true . So they said , " It must be his angel . "
44012016	Peter kept on knocking . When they opened the door and saw him , they were amazed .
44012017	Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet . He explained how the Lord had brought him out of prison . " Tell James and the others about this , " he said . Then he went to another place .
44012018	In the morning the soldiers were bewildered . They couldn't figure out what had happened to Peter .
44012019	So Herod had them look everywhere for Peter . But they didn't find him . Then Herod questioned the guards closely . He ordered that they be put to death . Herod went from Judea to Caesarea . He stayed there awhile .
44012020	He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon . So they got together and asked for a meeting with him . This was because they depended on the king's country to supply them with food . They gained the support of Blastus and asked for peace . Blastus was a trusted personal servant of the king .
44012021	The appointed day came . Herod was seated on his throne . He was wearing his royal robes . He made a speech to the people .
44012022	Then they shouted , " This is the voice of a god . It's not the voice of a man . "
44012023	Right away an angel of the Lord struck Herod down . Herod had not given praise to God . So he was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	But God's word continued to increase and spread .
44012025	Barnabas and Saul finished their task . Then they returned from Jerusalem . They took John Mark with them .
44013001	In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers . Among them were Barnabas , Simeon , and Lucius from Cyrene . Simeon was also called Niger . Another was Manaen . He had been brought up with Herod , the ruler of Galilee . Saul was among them too .
44013002	While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit spoke . " Set apart Barnabas and Saul for me , " he said . " I have appointed them to do special work . "
44013003	The prophets and teachers fasted and prayed . They placed their hands on Barnabas and Saul . Then they sent them off .
44013004	Barnabas and Saul were sent on their way by the Holy Spirit . They went down to Seleucia . From there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	They arrived at Salamis . There they preached God's word in the Jewish synagogues . John was with them as their helper .
44013006	They traveled all across the island until they came to Paphos . There they met a Jew named Bar-Jesus . He was an evil magician and a false prophet .
44013007	He was an attendant of Sergius Paulus , the governor . Paulus was a man of understanding . He sent for Barnabas and Saul . He wanted to hear God's word .
44013008	But Elymas , the evil magician , opposed them . The name Elymas means " magician . " He tried to keep the governor from becoming a believer .
44013009	Saul was also known as Paul . He was filled with the Holy Spirit . He looked straight at Elymas . He said to him ,
44013010	" You are a child of the devil ! You are an enemy of everything that is right ! You cheat people . You use all kinds of tricks . Won't you ever stop twisting the right ways of the Lord ?
44013011	Now the Lord's hand is against you . You are going to go blind . You won't be able to see the light of the sun for a while . " Right away mist and darkness came over him . He tried to feel his way around . He wanted to find someone to lead him by the hand .
44013012	When the governor saw what had happened , he believed . He was amazed at what Paul was teaching about the Lord .
44013013	From Paphos , Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia . There John left them and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch . On the Sabbath day they entered the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	The Law and the Prophets were read aloud . Then the synagogue rulers sent word to Paul and his companions . They said , " Brothers , do you have a message of hope for the people ? If you do , please speak . "
44013016	Paul stood up and motioned with his hand . Then he said , " Men of Israel , and you non-Jews who worship God , listen to me !
44013017	The God of Israel chose our people who lived long ago . He blessed them greatly while they were in Egypt . With his mighty power he led them out of that country .
44013018	He put up with them for about 40 years in the desert .
44013019	He destroyed seven nations in Canaan . Then he gave the land to his people as their rightful share .
44013020	All of this took about 450 years . " After this , God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet .
44013021	Then the people asked for a king . He gave them Saul , son of Kish . Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin . He ruled for 40 years .
44013022	God removed him and made David their king . Here is God's witness about him . ' David , son of Jesse , is a man dear to my heart , ' he said . ' He will do everything I want him to do . '
44013023	" From this man's family line God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus . This is what he had promised .
44013024	Before Jesus came , John preached that we should turn away from our sins and be baptized . He preached this to all Israel .
44013025	John was coming to the end of his work . ' Who do you think I am ? ' he said . ' I am not the one you are looking for . No , he is coming after me . I am not good enough to untie his sandals . '
44013026	" Listen , brothers , you children of Abraham ! Listen , you non-Jews who worship God ! This message of salvation has been sent to us .
44013027	The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus . By finding him guilty , they made the prophets' words come true . These are read every Sabbath day .
44013028	The people and their rulers had no reason at all for sentencing Jesus to death . But they asked Pilate to have him killed .
44013029	They did everything that had been written about Jesus . Then they took him down from the cross . They laid him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from the dead .
44013031	For many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem . Now they are his witnesses to our people .
44013032	" We are telling you the good news . What God promised our people long ago
44013033	he has done for us , their children . He has raised up Jesus . This is what is written in the second Psalm . It says , " ' You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . '
44013034	God raised Jesus from the dead . He will never rot in the grave . This is what is written in Scripture . It says , " ' Holy and sure blessings were promised to David . I will give them to you . '
44013035	In another place it says , " ' You will not let your Holy One rot away . '
44013036	" David carried out God's purpose while he lived . Then he died . He was buried with his people . His body rotted away .
44013037	But the One whom God raised from the dead did not rot away .
44013038	" My brothers , here is what I want you to know . I announce to you that your sins can be forgiven because of what Jesus has done .
44013039	Through him everyone who believes is made right with God . Moses' law could not make you right in God's eyes .
44013040	Be careful ! Don't let what the prophets spoke about happen to you . They said ,
44013041	" ' Look , you who make fun of the truth ! Wonder and die ! I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe . You wouldn't believe it even if someone told you . ' "
44013042	Paul and Barnabas started to leave the synagogue . The people invited them to say more about these things on the next Sabbath day .
44013043	The people were told they could leave the service . Many Jews followed Paul and Barnabas . Many non-Jews who faithfully worshiped the God of the Jews did the same . Paul and Barnabas talked with them . They tried to get them to keep living in God's grace .
44013044	On the next Sabbath day , almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord .
44013045	When the Jews saw the crowds , they became very jealous . They said evil things against what Paul was saying .
44013046	Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly . " We had to speak God's word to you first , " they said . " But you don't accept it . You don't think you are good enough for eternal life . So now we are turning to those who aren't Jews .
44013047	This is what the Lord has commanded us to do . He said , " ' I have made you a light for those who aren't Jews . You will bring salvation to the whole earth . ' "
44013048	When the non-Jews heard this , they were glad . They honored the word of the Lord . All who were appointed for eternal life believed .
44013049	The word of the Lord spread through the whole area .
44013050	But the Jews stirred up the important women who worshiped God . They also stirred up the men who were leaders in the city . They tried to get them to attack Paul and Barnabas . They threw them out of that area .
44013051	Paul and Barnabas didn't like this . So they shook the dust from their feet . They went on to Iconium .
44013052	The believers were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	At Iconium , Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue as usual . They spoke there with great power . Large numbers of Jews and non-Jews became believers .
44014002	But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up those who weren't Jews . They poisoned their minds against the two men and the new believers .
44014003	So Paul and Barnabas spent a lot of time there . They spoke boldly for the Lord . He gave them the ability to do miraculous signs and wonders . In this way the Lord showed that they were telling the truth about his grace .
44014004	The people of the city did not agree with each other . Some were on the side of the Jews . Others were on the side of the apostles .
44014005	Jews and non-Jews alike planned to treat Paul and Barnabas badly . Their leaders agreed . They planned to kill them by throwing stones at them .
44014006	But Paul and Barnabas found out about the plan . They escaped to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding area .
44014007	There they continued to preach the good news .
44014008	In Lystra there sat a man who couldn't walk . He hadn't been able to use his feet since the day he was born .
44014009	He listened as Paul spoke . Paul looked right at him . He saw that the man had faith to be healed .
44014010	So he called out , " Stand up on your feet ! " Then the man jumped up and began to walk .
44014011	The crowd saw what Paul had done . They shouted in the Lycaonian language . " The gods have come down to us in human form ! " they exclaimed .
44014012	They called Barnabas Zeus . Paul was the main speaker . So they called him Hermes .
44014013	Just outside the city was the temple of the god Zeus . The priest of Zeus brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates . He and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to Paul and Barnabas .
44014014	But the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about this . So they tore their clothes . They rushed out into the crowd . They shouted ,
44014015	" Why are you men doing this ? We are only human , just like you . We are bringing you good news . Turn away from these worthless things . Turn to the living God . He is the one who made the heavens and the earth and the sea . He made everything in them .
44014016	In the past , he let all nations go their own way .
44014017	But he has given proof of what he is like . He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven . He gives you crops in their seasons . He provides you with plenty of food . He fills your hearts with joy . "
44014018	Paul and Barnabas told them all these things . But they had trouble keeping the crowd from offering sacrifices to them .
44014019	Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium . They won the crowd over to their side . They threw stones at Paul . They thought he was dead , so they dragged him out of the city .
44014020	The believers gathered around Paul . Then he got up and went back into the city . The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe .
44014021	Paul and Barnabas preached the good news in the city of Derbe . They won large numbers of followers . Then they returned to Lystra , Iconium and Antioch .
44014022	There they helped the believers gain strength . They told them to remain true to what they had been taught . " We must go through many hard times to enter God's kingdom , " they said .
44014023	Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church . The elders had trusted in the Lord . Paul and Barnabas prayed and fasted . They placed the elders in the Lord's care .
44014024	After going through Pisidia , Paul and Barnabas came into Pamphylia .
44014025	They preached the word in Perga . Then they went down to Attalia .
44014026	From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch . That was where they had been committed to God's grace . They had now completed the work God had given them to do .
44014027	When they arrived at Antioch , they gathered the church together . They reported all that God had done through them . They told how he had opened the way for non-Jews to believe .
44014028	And they stayed there a long time with the believers .
44015001	Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch . Here is what they were teaching the believers . " Moses commanded you to be circumcised , " they said . " If you aren't , you can't be saved . "
44015002	But Paul and Barnabas didn't agree with this . They argued strongly with them . So Paul and Barnabas were appointed to go up to Jerusalem . Some other believers were chosen to go with them . They were supposed to see the apostles and elders about this question .
44015003	The church sent them on their way . As they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria , they told how those who weren't Jews had turned to God . This news made all the believers very glad .
44015004	When they arrived in Jerusalem , the church welcomed them . The apostles and elders welcomed them too . Then Paul and Barnabas reported everything God had done through them .
44015005	Some of the believers were Pharisees . They stood up and said , " Those who aren't Jews must be circumcised . They must obey the law of Moses . "
44015006	The apostles and elders met to consider this question .
44015007	After they had talked it over , Peter got up and spoke to them . " Brothers , " he said , " you know that some time ago God chose me to take the good news to those who aren't Jews . He wanted them to hear the good news and believe .
44015008	God knows the human heart . By giving the Holy Spirit to non-Jews , he showed that he accepted them . He did the same for them as he had done for us .
44015009	He showed that there is no difference between us and them . He made their hearts pure because of their faith .
44015010	" Now then , why are you trying to test God ? You test him when you put a heavy load on the believers' shoulders . Our people of long ago couldn't carry that load . We can't either .
44015011	No ! We believe we are saved through the grace of our Lord Jesus . Those who aren't Jews are saved in the same way . "
44015012	Everyone became quiet as they listened to Barnabas and Paul . They were telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done through them among non-Jews .
44015013	When they finished , James spoke up . " Brothers , " he said , " listen to me .
44015014	Simon Peter has explained to us how God first showed his concern for those who aren't Jews . He chose some of them to be his very own people .
44015015	The prophets' words agree with that . They say ,
44015016	" ' After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent . I will rebuild what was destroyed . I will make it what it used to be .
44015017	Then the rest of the people can look to the Lord . This means all the non-Jews who belong to me . The Lord says this . He is the one who does these things . '
44015018	The Lord does things that have been known for a long time .
44015019	" Now here is my opinion . We should not make it hard for the non-Jews who are turning to God .
44015020	Here is what we should write to them . They must not eat food polluted by being offered to statues of gods . They must not commit sexual sins . They must not eat the meat of animals that have been choked to death . And they must not drink blood .
44015021	These laws of Moses have been preached in every city from the earliest times . They are read out loud in the synagogues every Sabbath day . "
44015022	Then the apostles , the elders and the whole church decided what to do . They would choose some of their own men . They would send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . So they chose two leaders among the believers . Their names were Judas Barsabbas and Silas .
44015023	Here is the letter they sent with them . The apostles and elders , your brothers , are writing this letter . We are sending it to the non-Jewish believers in Antioch , Syria and Cilicia . Greetings .
44015024	We have heard that some of our people came to you and caused trouble . You were upset by what they said . But we had given them no authority to go .
44015025	So we all agreed to send our dear friends Barnabas and Paul to you . We chose some others to go with them .
44015026	Barnabas and Paul have put their lives in danger for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	So we are sending Judas and Silas with them . What they say will agree with this letter .
44015028	It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to give you a load that is too heavy . So here are a few basic rules .
44015029	Don't eat food that has been offered to statues of gods . Don't drink blood . Don't eat the meat of animals that have been choked to death . And don't commit sexual sins . You will do well to keep away from these things . Farewell .
44015030	The men were sent down to Antioch . There they gathered the church together . They gave the letter to them .
44015031	The people read it . They were glad for its message of hope .
44015032	Judas and Silas were prophets . They said many things to give strength and hope to the believers .
44015035	Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch . There they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord .
44015036	Some time later Paul spoke to Barnabas . " Let's go back to all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord , " he said . " Let's visit the believers and see how they are doing . "
44015037	Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them .
44015038	But Paul didn't think it was wise to take him . Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia . He hadn't continued with them in their work .
44015039	Barnabas and Paul strongly disagreed with each other . So they went their separate ways . Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus .
44015040	But Paul chose Silas . The believers asked the Lord to give his grace to Paul and Silas as they went .
44015041	Paul traveled through Syria and Cilicia . He gave strength to the churches there .
44016001	Paul came to Derbe . Then he went on to Lystra . A believer named Timothy lived there . His mother was Jewish and a believer . His father was a Greek .
44016002	The believers at Lystra and Iconium said good things about Timothy .
44016003	Paul wanted to take him along on the journey . So he circumcised Timothy because of the Jews who lived in that area . They all knew that Timothy's father was a Greek .
44016004	Paul and his companions traveled from town to town . They reported what the apostles and elders in Jerusalem had decided . The people were supposed to obey what was in the report .
44016005	So the churches were made strong in the faith . The number of believers grew every day .
44016006	Paul and his companions traveled all through the area of Phrygia and Galatia . The Holy Spirit had kept them from preaching the word in Asia Minor .
44016007	They came to the border of Mysia . From there they tried to enter Bithynia . But the Spirit of Jesus would not let them .
44016008	So they passed by Mysia . Then they went down to Troas .
44016009	During the night Paul had a vision . He saw a man from Macedonia standing and begging him . " Come over to Macedonia ! " the man said . " Help us ! "
44016010	After Paul had seen the vision , we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia . We decided that God had called us to preach the good news there .
44016011	At Troas we got into a boat . We sailed straight for Samothrace . The next day we went on to Neapolis .
44016012	From there we traveled to Philippi , a Roman colony . It is an important city in that part of Macedonia . We stayed there several days .
44016013	On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate . We walked down to the river . There we expected to find a place of prayer . We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered together .
44016014	One of those listening was a woman named Lydia . She was from the city of Thyatira . Her business was selling purple cloth . She was a worshiper of God . The Lord opened her heart to accept Paul's message .
44016015	She and her family were baptized . Then she invited us to her home . " Do you consider me a believer in the Lord ? " she asked . " If you do , come and stay at my house . " She succeeded in getting us to go home with her .
44016016	One day we were going to the place of prayer . On the way we were met by a female slave . She had a spirit that helped her to tell ahead of time what was going to happen . She earned a lot of money for her owners by telling fortunes .
44016017	The woman followed Paul and the rest of us around . She shouted , " These men serve the Most High God . They are telling you how to be saved . "
44016018	She kept this up for many days . Finally Paul became upset . Turning around , he spoke to the spirit . " In the name of Jesus Christ , " he said , " I command you to come out of her ! " At that very moment the spirit left her .
44016019	The female slave's owners realized that their hope of making money was gone . So they grabbed Paul and Silas . They dragged them into the market place to face the authorities .
44016020	They brought them to the judges . " These men are Jews , " her owners said . " They are making trouble in our city .
44016021	They are suggesting practices that are against Roman law . These are practices we can't accept or take part in . "
44016022	The crowd joined the attack against Paul and Silas . The judges ordered that Paul and Silas be stripped and beaten .
44016023	They were whipped without mercy . Then they were thrown into prison . The jailer was commanded to guard them carefully .
44016024	When he received his orders , he put Paul and Silas deep inside the prison . He fastened their feet so they couldn't get away .
44016025	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying . They were also singing hymns to God . The other prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	Suddenly there was a powerful earthquake . It shook the prison from top to bottom . All at once the prison doors flew open . Everybody's chains came loose .
44016027	The jailer woke up . He saw that the prison doors were open . He pulled out his sword and was going to kill himself . He thought the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	" Don't harm yourself ! " Paul shouted . " We are all here ! "
44016029	The jailer called out for some lights . He rushed in , shaking with fear . He fell down in front of Paul and Silas .
44016030	Then he brought them out . He asked , " Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? "
44016031	They replied , " Believe in the Lord Jesus . Then you and your family will be saved . "
44016032	They spoke the word of the Lord to him . They also spoke to all the others in his house .
44016033	At that hour of the night , the jailer took Paul and Silas and washed their wounds . Right away he and his whole family were baptized .
44016034	The jailer brought them into his house . He set a meal in front of them . He and his whole family were filled with joy . They had become believers in God .
44016035	Early in the morning the judges sent their officers to the jailer . They ordered him , " Let those men go . "
44016036	The jailer told Paul , " The judges have ordered me to set you and Silas free . You can leave now . Go in peace . "
44016037	But Paul replied to the officers . " They beat us in public , " he said . " We weren't given a trial . And we are Roman citizens ! They threw us into prison . And now do they want to get rid of us quietly ? No ! Let them come themselves and personally lead us out . "
44016038	The officers reported this to the judges . When the judges heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens , they became afraid .
44016039	So they came and said they were sorry . They led them out of the prison . Then they asked them to leave the city .
44016040	After Paul and Silas came out of the prison , they went to Lydia's house . There they met with the believers . They told them to be brave . Then they left .
44017001	Paul and Silas passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia . They came to Thessalonica . A Jewish synagogue was there .
44017002	Paul went into the synagogue as he usually did . For three Sabbath days in a row he talked about the Scriptures with the Jews .
44017003	He explained and proved that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead . " This Jesus I am telling you about is the Christ ! " he said .
44017004	His words won some of the Jews over . They joined Paul and Silas . A large number of Greeks who worshiped God joined them too . So did quite a few important women .
44017005	But the Jews were jealous . So they rounded up some evil fellows from the market place . Forming a crowd , they started all kinds of trouble in the city . The Jews rushed to Jason's house . They were looking for Paul and Silas . They wanted to bring them out to the crowd .
44017006	But they couldn't find them . So they dragged Jason and some other believers to the city officials . " These men have caused trouble all over the world , " they shouted . " Now they have come here .
44017007	Jason has welcomed them into his house . They are all disobeying Caesar's commands . They say there is another king . He is called Jesus . "
44017008	When the crowd and the city officials heard this , they became very upset .
44017009	They made Jason and the others give them money . They wanted to make sure they would return to the court . Then they let them go .
44017010	As soon as it was night , the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea . When they arrived , they went to the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	The Bereans were very glad to receive Paul's message . They studied the Scriptures carefully every day . They wanted to see if what Paul said was true . So they were more noble than the Thessalonians .
44017012	Many of the Jews believed . A number of important Greek women also became believers . And so did many Greek men .
44017013	The Jews in Thessalonica found out that Paul was preaching God's word in Berea . So they went there too . They stirred up the crowds and got them all worked up .
44017014	Right away the believers sent Paul to the coast . But Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea .
44017015	The men who went with Paul took him to Athens . Then they returned with orders that Silas and Timothy were supposed to join him as soon as they could .
44017016	Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy in Athens . He was very upset to see that the city was full of statues of gods .
44017017	So he went to the synagogue . There he talked with Jews and with Greeks who worshiped God . Each day he spoke with anyone who happened to be in the market place .
44017018	A group of Epicurean and Stoic thinkers began to argue with him . Some of them asked , " What is this fellow chattering about ? " Others said , " He seems to be telling us about gods we've never heard of . " They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus . He was telling them that Jesus had risen from the dead .
44017019	They took him to a meeting of the Areopagus . There they said to him , " What is this new teaching you're giving us ?
44017020	You have some strange ideas . We've never heard them before . We want to know what they mean . "
44017021	All the people of Athens spent their time talking about and listening to the latest ideas . People from other lands who lived there did the same .
44017022	Then Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus . He said , " Men of Athens ! I see that you are very religious in every way .
44017023	As I walked around , I looked carefully at the things you worship . I even found an altar with to an unknown god written on it . Now I am going to tell you about this ' unknown god ' that you worship .
44017024	" He is the God who made the world . He also made everything in it . He is the Lord of heaven and earth . He doesn't live in temples built by hands .
44017025	He is not served by human hands . He doesn't need anything . He himself gives life and breath to all people . He also gives them everything else they have .
44017026	From one man he made all the people of the world . Now they live all over the earth . He decided exactly when they should live . And he decided exactly where they should live .
44017027	God did this so that people would seek him . Then perhaps they would reach out for him and find him . They would find him even though he is not far from any of us .
44017028	' In him we live and move and exist . ' As some of your own poets have also said , ' We are his children . '
44017029	" Yes , we are God's children . So we shouldn't think that God is made out of gold or silver or stone . He isn't a statue planned and made by clever people .
44017030	In the past , God didn't judge people for what they didn't know . But now he commands all people everywhere to turn away from their sins .
44017031	He has set a day when he will judge the world fairly . He has appointed a man to be its judge . God has proved this to all people by raising that man from the dead . "
44017032	When they heard Paul talk about the dead rising , some of them made fun of it . But others said , " We want to hear you speak about this again . "
44017033	So Paul left the meeting of the Areopagus .
44017034	A few men became followers of Paul and believed in Jesus . Dionysius was one of them . He was a member of the Areopagus . A woman named Damaris also became a believer . And so did some others .
44018001	After this , Paul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	There he met a Jew named Aquila , who was a native of Pontus . Aquila had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla . The emperor Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome . Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla .
44018003	They were tentmakers , just as he was . So he stayed and worked with them .
44018004	Every Sabbath day he went to the synagogue . He was trying to get both Jews and Greeks to believe in the Lord .
44018005	Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia . Then Paul spent all his time preaching . He gave witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
44018006	But the Jews opposed Paul . They treated him badly . He didn't like this . So he shook out his clothes . Then he said to them , " Anything that happens to you will be your own fault ! Don't blame me for it ! From now on I will go to people who are not Jews . "
44018007	Then Paul left the synagogue . He went next door to the house of Titius Justus , a man who worshiped God .
44018008	Crispus was the synagogue ruler . He and his whole family came to believe in the Lord . Many others who lived in Corinth heard Paul . They too believed and were baptized .
44018009	One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision . " Don't be afraid , " he said . " Keep on speaking . Don't be silent .
44018010	I am with you . No one will attack you and harm you . I have many people in this city . "
44018011	So Paul stayed there for a year and a half . He taught them God's word .
44018012	At that time Gallio was governor of Achaia . The Jews got together and attacked Paul . They brought him into court .
44018013	" This man , " they charged , " is trying to talk people into worshiping God in ways that are against the law . "
44018014	Paul was about to speak up for himself . But just then Gallio spoke to the Jews . " You Jews are not claiming that Paul has committed a crime , whether large or small , " he said . " If you were , it would make sense for me to listen to you .
44018015	But this is about your own law . It is a question of words and names . Settle the matter yourselves . I will not be a judge of such things . "
44018016	So he had them thrown out of the court .
44018017	Then all the Jews turned against Sosthenes . He was the synagogue ruler . They beat him up in front of the court . But Gallio didn't care at all .
44018018	Paul stayed in Corinth for some time . Then he left the believers and sailed for Syria . Priscilla and Aquila went with him . Before he sailed , he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea . He did this because he had made a promise to God .
44018019	They arrived at Ephesus . There Paul said good-by to Priscilla and Aquila . He himself went into the synagogue and talked with the Jews .
44018020	The Jews asked him to spend more time with them . But he said no .
44018021	As he left , he made them a promise . " If God wants me to , " he said , " I will come back . " Then he sailed from Ephesus .
44018022	When he landed at Caesarea , he went up to Jerusalem . There he greeted the church . He then went down to Antioch .
44018023	Paul spent some time in Antioch . Then he left and traveled all over Galatia and Phrygia . He gave strength to all the believers there .
44018024	At that time a Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus . He was an educated man from Alexandria . He knew the Scriptures very well .
44018025	Apollos had been taught the way of the Lord . He spoke with great power . He taught the truth about Jesus . But he only knew about John's baptism .
44018026	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue . Priscilla and Aquila heard him . So they invited him to their home . There they gave him a better understanding of the way of God .
44018027	Apollos wanted to go to Achaia . The brothers agreed with him . They wrote to the believers there . They asked them to welcome him . When he arrived , he was a great help to those who had become believers by God's grace .
44018028	He argued strongly against the Jews in public meetings . He proved from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ .
44019001	While Apollos was at Corinth , Paul took the road to Ephesus . When he arrived , he found some believers there .
44019002	He asked them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers ? " " No , " they answered . " We haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . "
44019003	So Paul asked , " Then what baptism did you receive ? " " John's baptism , " they replied .
44019004	Paul said , " John baptized people , calling them to turn away from their sins . He told them to believe in the one who was coming after him . Jesus is that one . "
44019005	After hearing this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	Paul placed his hands on them . Then the Holy Spirit came on them . They spoke in languages they had not known before . They also prophesied .
44019007	There were about 12 of them in all .
44019008	Paul entered the synagogue . There he spoke boldly for three months . He tried to talk the people into accepting his teaching about God's kingdom .
44019009	But some of them wouldn't listen . They refused to believe . In public they said evil things about the Way of Jesus . So Paul left them . He took the believers with him . Each day he talked with people in the lecture hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This went on for two years . So all the Jews and Greeks who lived in Asia Minor heard the word of the Lord .
44019011	God did amazing miracles through Paul .
44019012	Even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to those who were sick . When this happened , their sicknesses were healed and evil spirits left them .
44019013	Some Jews went around driving out evil spirits . They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to set free those who were controlled by demons . They said , " In Jesus' name I command you to come out . He is the Jesus that Paul is preaching about . "
44019014	Seven sons of Sceva were doing this . Sceva was a Jewish chief priest .
44019015	One day the evil spirit answered them , " I know Jesus . And I know about Paul . But who are you ? "
44019016	Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on Sceva's sons . He overpowered them all . He gave them a terrible beating . They ran out of the house naked and bleeding .
44019017	The Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus heard about this . They were all overcome with fear . They held the name of the Lord Jesus in high honor .
44019018	Many who believed now came and openly admitted the evil they had done .
44019019	A number of those who had practiced evil magic brought their scrolls together . They set them on fire out in the open . They added up the value of the scrolls . They found that it would take more than two lifetimes to earn what the scrolls were worth .
44019020	The word of the Lord spread everywhere . It became more and more powerful .
44019021	After all this had happened , Paul decided to go to Jerusalem . He went through Macedonia and Achaia . " After I have been to Jerusalem , " he said , " I must visit Rome also . "
44019022	He sent Timothy and Erastus , two of his helpers , to Macedonia . But he stayed a little longer in Asia Minor .
44019023	At that time many people became very upset about the Way of Jesus .
44019024	There was a man named Demetrius who made things out of silver . He made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis . He brought in a lot of business for the other skilled workers .
44019025	One day he called them together . He also called others who were in the same kind of business . " Men , " he said , " you know that we make good money from our work .
44019026	You have seen and heard what this fellow Paul is doing . He has talked to large numbers of people here in Ephesus . Almost everywhere in Asia Minor he has led people away from our gods . He says that the gods we make are not gods at all .
44019027	Our work is in danger of losing its good name . People's faith in the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be weakened . Now she is worshiped through all of Asia Minor and the whole world . But soon she will be robbed of her greatness . "
44019028	When they heard this , they became very angry . They began shouting , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
44019029	Soon people were making trouble in the whole city . They all rushed into the theater . They dragged Gaius and Aristarchus along with them . These two men had come with Paul from Macedonia .
44019030	Paul wanted to appear in front of the crowd . But the believers wouldn't let him .
44019031	Some of the officials in Asia Minor were friends of Paul . They sent him a message , begging him not to go into the theater .
44019032	The crowd didn't know what was going on . Some were shouting one thing and some another . Most of the people didn't even know why they were there .
44019033	The Jews pushed Alexander to the front . Some of the crowd tried to tell him what to say . But he motioned for them to be quiet . He wanted to speak up for himself in front of the people .
44019034	But then they realized that he was a Jew . So they all shouted the same thing for about two hours . " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! " they yelled .
44019035	The city clerk quieted the crowd down . " Men of Ephesus ! " he said . " The whole world knows that the city of Ephesus guards the temple of the great Artemis . They know that Ephesus guards her statue , which fell from heaven .
44019036	These facts can't be questioned . So calm down . Don't do anything foolish .
44019037	" These men haven't robbed any temples . They haven't said evil things against our goddess . But you have brought them here anyhow .
44019038	Demetrius and the other skilled workers may feel they have been wronged by someone . Let them bring charges . The courts are open . We have our governors .
44019039	Is there anything else you want to bring up ? Settle it in a court of law .
44019040	As it is , today we are in danger of being charged with causing all this trouble . But there is no reason for it . We wouldn't be able to explain what has happened . "
44019041	After he said this , he sent the people away .
44020001	All the trouble came to an end . Then Paul sent for the believers . After cheering them up , he said good-by . He then left for Macedonia .
44020002	He traveled through that area , speaking many words of hope to the people . Finally he arrived in Greece .
44020003	There he stayed for three months . He was just about to sail for Syria . But the Jews were making plans against him . So he decided to go back through Macedonia .
44020004	Sopater , son of Pyrrhus , from Berea went with him . Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica , Gaius from Derbe , and Timothy went too . Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia Minor also went with him .
44020005	These men went on ahead . They waited for us at Troas .
44020006	But we sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread . Five days later we joined the others at Troas . We stayed there for seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week we met to break bread and eat together . Paul spoke to the people . He kept on talking until midnight because he planned to leave the next day .
44020008	There were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting .
44020009	A young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window . He sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on . Sound asleep , Eutychus fell from the third floor . When they picked him up from the ground , he was dead .
44020010	Paul went down and threw himself on the young man . He put his arms around him . " Don't be alarmed , " he told them . " He's alive ! "
44020011	Then Paul went upstairs again . He broke bread and ate with them . He kept on talking until daylight . Then he left .
44020012	The people took the young man home . They were greatly comforted because he was alive .
44020013	We went on ahead to the ship . We sailed for Assos . There we were going to take Paul on board . He had planned it this way because he wanted to go there by land .
44020014	So he met us at Assos . We took him on board and went on to Mitylene .
44020015	The next day we sailed from there . We arrived near Kios . The day after that we crossed over to Samos . We arrived at Miletus the next day .
44020016	Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus . He didn't want to spend time in Asia Minor . He was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem . If he could , he wanted to be there by the day of Pentecost .
44020017	From Miletus , Paul sent for the elders of the church at Ephesus .
44020018	When they arrived , he spoke to them . " You know how I lived the whole time I was with you , " he said . " From the first day I came into Asia Minor ,
44020019	I was free of pride . I served the Lord with tears . I served him even though I was greatly tested by the evil plans of the Jews .
44020020	You know I haven't let anyone keep me from preaching anything that would be helpful to you . I have taught you in public and from house to house .
44020021	I have told both Jews and Greeks that they must turn away from their sins to God . They must have faith in our Lord Jesus .
44020022	" Now I am going to Jerusalem . The Holy Spirit compels me . I don't know what will happen to me there .
44020023	I only know that in every city the Spirit warns me . He tells me that I will face prison and suffering .
44020024	But my life means nothing to me . I only want to finish the race . I want to complete the work the Lord Jesus has given me . He wants me to give witness to others about the good news of God's grace .
44020025	" I have spent time with you preaching about the kingdom . I know that none of you will ever see me again .
44020026	So I tell you today that I am not guilty if anyone has not believed .
44020027	I haven't let anyone keep me from telling you everything God wants you to do .
44020028	" Keep watch over yourselves . Keep watch over all the believers . The Holy Spirit has made you leaders over them . Be shepherds of God's church . He bought it with his own blood .
44020029	" I know that after I leave , wild wolves will come in among you . They won't spare any of the sheep .
44020030	Even men from your own people will rise up and twist the truth . They want to get the believers to follow them .
44020031	So be on your guard ! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning you . Night and day I warned each of you with tears .
44020032	" Now I commit you to God's care . I commit you to the word of his grace . It can build you up . Then you will share in what God plans to give all his people .
44020033	I haven't longed for anyone's silver or gold or clothing .
44020034	You yourselves know that I have used my own hands to meet my needs . I have also met the needs of my companions .
44020035	In everything I did , I showed you that we must work hard and help the weak . We must remember the words of the Lord Jesus . He said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive . ' "
44020036	When Paul had said this , he got down on his knees with all of them and prayed .
44020037	They all cried as they hugged and kissed him .
44020038	What hurt them the most was that he had said they would never see his face again . Then they went with him to the ship .
44021001	After we had torn ourselves away from the Ephesian elders , we headed out to sea . We sailed straight to Cos . The next day we went to Rhodes . From there we continued on to Patara .
44021002	We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia . So we went on board and headed out to sea .
44021003	We came near Cyprus and passed to the south of it . Then we sailed on to Syria . We landed at Tyre . There our ship was supposed to unload .
44021004	We found the believers there and stayed with them for seven days . Led by the Holy Spirit , they tried to get Paul not to go on to Jerusalem .
44021005	But when it was time to leave , we continued on our way . All the believers and their families went with us out of the city . There on the beach we got down on our knees to pray .
44021006	We said good-by to each other . Then we went on board the ship . And they returned home .
44021007	Continuing on from Tyre , we landed at Ptolemais . There we greeted the brothers and sisters . We stayed with them for a day .
44021008	The next day we left and arrived at Caesarea . We stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist . He was one of the seven deacons .
44021009	He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied .
44021010	We stayed there several days . Then a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	He came over to us . Then he took Paul's belt and tied his own hands and feet with it . He said , " The Holy Spirit says , ' This is how the Jews of Jerusalem will tie up the owner of this belt . They will hand him over to people who are not Jews . ' "
44021012	When we heard this , we all begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	He asked , " Why are you crying ? Why are you breaking my heart ? I'm ready to be put in prison . In fact , I'm ready to die in Jerusalem for the Lord Jesus . "
44021014	We couldn't change his mind . So we gave up . We said , " May what the Lord wants to happen be done . "
44021015	After this , we got ready and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the believers from Caesarea went with us . They brought us to Mnason's home . We were supposed to stay there . Mnason was from Cyprus . He was one of the first believers .
44021017	When we arrived in Jerusalem , the brothers and sisters gave us a warm welcome .
44021018	The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James . All the elders were there .
44021019	Paul greeted them . Then he reported everything God had done among the non-Jews through his work .
44021020	When they heard this , they praised God . Then they spoke to Paul . " Brother , " they said , " you see that thousands of Jews have become believers . All of them try very hard to obey the law .
44021021	They have been told that you teach all the Jews who live among the non-Jews to turn away from Moses . They think that you teach them not to circumcise their children . They think that you teach them to give up our Jewish ways .
44021022	" What should we do ? They will certainly hear that you have come .
44021023	So do what we tell you . There are four men with us who have made a promise to God .
44021024	Take them with you . Join them in the Jewish practice that makes people pure and clean . Pay their expenses so they can have their heads shaved . Then everybody will know that these reports about you are not true in any way . They will know that you yourself obey the law .
44021025	" We have already given written directions to the believers who are not Jews . They must not eat food that has been offered to statues of gods . They must not drink blood . They must not eat the meat of animals that have been choked to death . And they must not commit sexual sins . "
44021026	The next day Paul took the men with him . They all made themselves pure and clean in the usual way . Then Paul went to the temple . There he reported the date when the days of cleansing would end . At that time the proper offering would be made for each of them .
44021027	The seven days of cleansing were almost over . Some Jews from Asia Minor saw Paul at the temple . They stirred up the whole crowd . They arrested Paul .
44021028	" Men of Israel , help us ! " they shouted . " This is the man who teaches everyone in all places against our people . He speaks against our law and against this holy place . Besides , he has brought Greeks into the temple area . He has made this holy place unclean . "
44021029	They said this because they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul . They thought Paul had brought him into the temple area .
44021030	The whole city was stirred up . People came running from all directions . They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple . Right away the temple gates were shut .
44021031	The people were trying to kill Paul . But news reached the commander of the Roman troops . He heard that people were making trouble in the whole city of Jerusalem .
44021032	At once he took some officers and soldiers with him . They ran down to the crowd . The people causing the trouble saw the commander and his soldiers . So they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	The commander came up and arrested Paul . He ordered him to be held with two chains . Then he asked who Paul was and what he had done .
44021034	Some in the crowd shouted one thing , some another . But the commander couldn't get the facts because of all the noise . So he ordered that Paul be taken into the fort .
44021035	Paul reached the steps . But then the mob became so wild that he had to be carried by the soldiers .
44021036	The crowd that followed kept shouting , " Kill him ! "
44021037	The soldiers were about to take Paul into the fort . Then he asked the commander , " May I say something to you ? " " Do you speak Greek ? " he replied .
44021038	" Aren't you the Egyptian who turned some of our people against their leaders ? Didn't you lead 4,000 terrorists out into the desert some time ago ? "
44021039	Paul answered , " I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia . I am a citizen of an important city . Please let me speak to the people . "
44021040	The commander told him he could . So Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd . When all of them were quiet , he spoke to them in the Aramaic language .
44022001	" Brothers and fathers , " Paul began , " listen to me now . I want to speak up for myself . "
44022002	When they heard that he was speaking to them in Aramaic , they became very quiet . Then Paul said ,
44022003	" I am a Jew . I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia . But I grew up here in Jerusalem . I was well trained by Gamaliel in the law of our people . I wanted to serve God as much as any of you do today .
44022004	I hurt the followers of the Way of Jesus . I sent many of them to their death . I arrested men and women . I threw them into prison .
44022005	The high priest and the whole Council can give witness to this . I even had some official letters they had written to their friends in Damascus . So I went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished .
44022006	" I had almost reached Damascus . About noon a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me .
44022007	I fell to the ground and heard a voice speak to me . ' Saul ! Saul ! ' it said . ' Why are you opposing me ? '
44022008	" ' Who are you , Lord ? ' I asked . " ' I am Jesus of Nazareth , ' he replied . ' I am the one you are opposing . '
44022009	" The light was seen by my companions . But they didn't understand the voice of the one speaking to me .
44022010	" ' What should I do , Lord ? ' I asked . " ' Get up , ' the Lord said . ' Go into Damascus . There you will be told everything you have been given to do . '
44022011	The brightness of the light had blinded me . So my companions led me by the hand into Damascus .
44022012	" A man named Ananias came to see me . He was a godly Jew who obeyed the law . All the Jews living there respected him very much .
44022013	He stood beside me and said , ' Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ' At that very moment I was able to see him .
44022014	" Then he said , ' The God of our people has chosen you . He wanted to tell you his plans for you . You have seen the Blameless One . You have heard words from his mouth .
44022015	Now you will give witness to all people about what you have seen and heard .
44022016	So what are you waiting for ? Get up and call on his name . Be baptized . Have your sins washed away . '
44022017	" I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple . Then it seemed to me that I was dreaming .
44022018	I saw the Lord speaking to me . ' Quick ! ' he said . ' Leave Jerusalem at once . These people will not accept your witness about me . '
44022019	" ' Lord , ' I replied , ' these people know what I used to do . I went from one synagogue to another and put believers in prison . I also beat them .
44022020	Stephen was a man who gave witness to others about you . I stood there when he was killed . I had agreed that he should die . I even guarded the coats of those who were killing him . '
44022021	" Then the Lord said to me , ' Go . I will send you far away to people who are not Jews . ' "
44022022	The crowd listened to Paul until he said this . Then they shouted , " Kill him ! He isn't fit to live ! "
44022023	They shouted and threw off their coats . They threw dust into the air .
44022024	So the commanding officer ordered Paul to be taken into the fort . He gave orders for Paul to be whipped and questioned . He wanted to find out why the people were shouting at him like this .
44022025	A commander was standing there as they stretched Paul out to be whipped . Paul said to him , " Does the law allow you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty ? "
44022026	When the commander heard this , he went to the commanding officer and reported it . " What are you going to do ? " the commander asked . " This man is a Roman citizen . "
44022027	So the commanding officer went to Paul . " Tell me , " he asked . " Are you a Roman citizen ? " " Yes , I am , " Paul answered .
44022028	Then the officer said , " I had to pay a lot of money to become a citizen . " " But I was born a citizen , " Paul replied .
44022029	Right away those who were about to question him left . Even the officer was alarmed . He realized that he had put Paul , a Roman citizen , in chains .
44022030	The commanding officer wanted to find out exactly what the Jews had against Paul . So the next day he let Paul out of prison . He ordered a meeting of the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin . Then he brought Paul and had him stand in front of them .
44023001	Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin . " My brothers , " he said , " I have always done my duty to God . To this very day I feel that I have done nothing wrong . "
44023002	Ananias the high priest heard this . So he ordered the men standing near Paul to hit him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , " You pretender ! God will hit you ! You sit there and judge me by the law . But you yourself broke the law when you commanded them to hit me ! "
44023004	Those who were standing near Paul said , " How dare you talk like that to God's high priest ! "
44023005	Paul replied , " Brothers , I didn't realize he was the high priest . It is written , ' Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people . ' "
44023006	Paul knew that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees . So he called out in the Sanhedrin . " My brothers , " he said , " I am a Pharisee . I am the son of a Pharisee . I believe that people will rise from the dead . That's why I am on trial . "
44023007	When he said this , the Pharisees and the Sadducees started to argue . They began to take sides .
44023008	The Sadducees say that people will not rise from the dead . They don't believe there are angels or spirits either . But the Pharisees believe all these things .
44023009	People were causing trouble and making a lot of noise . Some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up . They argued strongly . " We find nothing wrong with this man , " they said . " What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him ? "
44023010	The arguing got out of hand . The commanding officer was afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by those who were arguing . So he ordered the soldiers to go down and take him away from them by force . They were supposed to bring him into the fort .
44023011	The next night the Lord stood near Paul . He said , " Be brave ! You have given witness about me in Jerusalem . You must do the same in Rome . "
44023012	The next morning the Jews gathered secretly to make plans against Paul . They took an oath that they would not eat or drink anything until they had killed him .
44023013	More than 40 men took part in this plan .
44023014	They went to the chief priests and the elders . They said , " We have taken a strong oath . We have made a special promise to God . We will not eat anything until we have killed Paul .
44023015	Now then , you and the Sanhedrin must make an appeal to the commanding officer . Ask him to bring Paul to you . Pretend you want more facts about his case . We are ready to kill him before he gets here . "
44023016	But Paul's nephew heard about this plan . So he went into the fort and told Paul .
44023017	Then Paul called one of the commanders . He said to him , " Take this young man to the commanding officer . He has something to tell him . "
44023018	So the commander took Paul's nephew to the officer . The commander said , " Paul , the prisoner , sent for me . He asked me to bring this young man to you . The young man has something to tell you . "
44023019	The commanding officer took the young man by the hand . He spoke to him in private . " What do you want to tell me ? " the officer asked .
44023020	He said , " The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul to the Sanhedrin tomorrow . They will pretend they want more facts about him .
44023021	Don't give in to them . More than 40 of them are waiting in hiding to attack him . They have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink anything until they have killed him . They are ready now . All they need is for you to bring Paul to the Sanhedrin . "
44023022	The commanding officer let the young man go . But he gave him a warning . " Don't tell anyone you have reported this to me , " he said .
44023023	Then the commanding officer called for two of his commanders . He ordered them , " Gather a company of 200 soldiers , 70 horsemen and 200 men armed with spears . Get them ready to go to Caesarea at nine o'clock tonight .
44023024	Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix . "
44023025	Here is the letter the officer wrote .
44023026	I , Claudius Lysias , am writing this letter . I am sending it to His Excellency , Governor Felix . Greetings .
44023027	The Jews grabbed Paul . They were about to kill him . But I came with my soldiers and saved him . I had learned that he is a Roman citizen .
44023028	I wanted to know why they were bringing charges against him . So I brought him to their Sanhedrin .
44023029	I found out that the charge against him was based on questions about their law . But there was no charge against him worthy of death or prison .
44023030	Then I was told about a plan against the man . So I sent him to you at once . I also ordered those bringing charges against him to tell you their case .
44023031	The soldiers followed their orders . During the night they took Paul with them . They brought him as far as Antipatris .
44023032	The next day they let the horsemen go on with him . The soldiers returned to the fort .
44023033	The horsemen arrived in Caesarea . They gave the letter to the governor . Then they handed Paul over to him .
44023034	The governor read the letter . He asked Paul where he was from . He learned that Paul was from Cilicia .
44023035	So he said , " I will hear your case when those bringing charges against you get here . " Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace .
44024001	Five days later Ananias the high priest went down to Caesarea . Some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus went with him . They brought their charges against Paul to the governor .
44024002	So Paul was called in . Tertullus began to bring the charges against Paul . He said to Felix , " We have enjoyed a long time of peace while you have been ruling . You are a wise leader . You have made this a better nation .
44024003	Most excellent Felix , we gladly admit this everywhere and in every way . And we are very thankful .
44024004	I don't want to bother you . But would you be kind enough to listen to us for a short time ?
44024005	" We have found that Paul is a troublemaker . He stirs up trouble among Jews all over the world . He is a leader of those who follow Jesus of Nazareth .
44024008	Question him yourself . Then you will learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him . "
44024009	The Jews said the same thing . They agreed that the charges were true .
44024010	The governor motioned for Paul to speak . Paul said , " I know that you have been a judge over this nation for quite a few years . So I am glad to stand up for myself .
44024011	About 12 days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship . You can easily check on this .
44024012	Those bringing charges against me did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple . I wasn't stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city .
44024013	They can't prove to you any of the charges they are making against me .
44024014	" It is true that I worship the God of our people . I am a follower of the Way of Jesus . Those bringing charges against me call it a cult . I believe everything that agrees with the Law . I believe everything written in the Prophets .
44024015	I have the same hope in God that these men have . I believe that both the godly and the ungodly will rise from the dead .
44024016	So I always try not to do anything wrong in the eyes of God and man .
44024017	" I was away for several years . Then I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for those who were poor . I also came to offer sacrifices .
44024018	They found me doing this in the temple courtyard . I had already been made pure and clean in the usual way . There was no crowd with me . I didn't stir up any trouble .
44024019	" But there are some other Jews who should be here in front of you . They are from Asia Minor . They should bring charges if they have anything against me .
44024020	Let the Jews who are here tell you what crime I am guilty of . After all , I was put on trial by the Sanhedrin .
44024021	Perhaps they blame me for what I said when I was on trial . I shouted , ' I believe that people will rise from the dead . That is why I am on trial here today . ' "
44024022	Felix knew all about the Way of Jesus . So he put off the trial for the time being . " Lysias the commanding officer will come , " he said . " Then I will decide your case . "
44024023	He ordered the commander to keep Paul under guard . He told him to give Paul some freedom . He also told him to allow Paul's friends to take care of his needs .
44024024	Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla . She was a Jew . Felix sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	Paul talked about how to live right . He talked about how people should control themselves . He also talked about the time when God will judge everyone . Then Felix became afraid . " That's enough for now ! " he said . " You may leave . When I find the time , I will send for you . "
44024026	He was hoping that Paul would offer him some money to let him go . So he often sent for Paul and talked with him .
44024027	Two years passed . Porcius Festus took the place of Felix . But Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor . So he left Paul in prison .
44025001	Three days after Festus arrived , he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
44025002	There the chief priests and Jewish leaders came to him and brought their charges against Paul .
44025003	They tried to get Festus to have Paul taken to Jerusalem . They asked for this as a favor . They were planning to hide and attack Paul along the way . They wanted to kill him .
44025004	Festus answered , " Paul is being held at Caesarea . Soon I'll be going there myself .
44025005	Let some of your leaders come with me . If the man has done anything wrong , they can bring charges against him there . "
44025006	Festus spent eight or ten days in Jerusalem with them . Then he went down to Caesarea . The next day he called the court together . He ordered Paul to be brought to him .
44025007	When Paul arrived , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him . They brought many strong charges against him . But they couldn't prove them .
44025008	Then Paul spoke up for himself . He said , " I've done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple . I've done nothing wrong against Caesar . "
44025009	But Festus wanted to do the Jews a favor . So he said to Paul , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem ? Are you willing to go on trial there ? Are you willing to face these charges in my court ? "
44025010	Paul answered , " I'm already standing in Caesar's court . This is where I should go on trial . I haven't done anything wrong to the Jews . You yourself know that very well .
44025011	If I am guilty of anything worthy of death , I'm willing to die . But the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true . No one has the right to hand me over to them . I make my appeal to Caesar ! "
44025012	Festus talked it over with the members of his court . Then he said , " You have made an appeal to Caesar . To Caesar you will go ! "
44025013	A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea . They came to pay a visit to Festus .
44025014	They were spending many days there . So Festus talked with the king about Paul's case . He said , " There's a man here that Felix left as a prisoner .
44025015	When I went to Jerusalem , the Jewish chief priests and the elders brought charges against the man . They wanted him to be found guilty .
44025016	" I told them that this is not the way Romans do things . We don't judge people before they have faced those bringing charges against them . They must have a chance to speak up for themselves .
44025017	When the Jews came back with me , I didn't waste any time . I called the court together the next day . I ordered the man to be brought in .
44025018	Those bringing charges against him got up to speak . But they didn't charge him with any of the crimes I had expected .
44025019	Instead , they argued with him about their own beliefs . They didn't agree about a dead man named Jesus . Paul claimed Jesus was alive .
44025020	" I had no idea how to look into such matters . So I asked Paul if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem . There he could be tried on these charges .
44025021	But Paul made an appeal to have the Emperor decide his case . So I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar . "
44025022	Then Agrippa said to Festus , " I would like to hear this man myself . " Festus replied , " Tomorrow you will hear him . "
44025023	The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived . They acted like very important people . They entered the courtroom . The most important officers and the leading men of the city came with them . When Festus gave the command , Paul was brought in .
44025024	Festus said , " King Agrippa , and all who are here with us , take a good look at this man ! Both in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea a large number of Jews have come to me about him . They keep shouting that he shouldn't live any longer .
44025025	I have found that he hasn't done anything worthy of death . But he made his appeal to the Emperor . So I decided to send him to Rome .
44025026	" I don't have anything certain to write about him to His Majesty . So I have brought him here today . Now all of you will be able to hear him . King Agrippa , it will also be very good for you to hear him . As a result of this hearing , I will have something to write .
44025027	It doesn't make sense to send a prisoner to Rome without listing the charges against him . "
44026001	Agrippa said to Paul , " You may now speak for yourself . " So Paul motioned with his hand . Then he began to stand up for himself .
44026002	" King Agrippa , " he said , " I am happy to be able to stand here today . I will speak up for myself against all the charges brought by the Jews .
44026003	I am very pleased that you are familiar with Jewish ways . You know the kinds of things they argue about . So I beg you to be patient as you listen to me .
44026004	" The Jews all know how I have lived ever since I was a child . They know all about me from the beginning of my life . They know how I lived in my own country and in Jerusalem .
44026005	They have known me for a long time . So if they wanted to , they could give witness that I lived by the rules of the Pharisees . Those rules are harder to obey than the rules of any other group in the Jewish faith .
44026006	" Today I am on trial because of the hope I have . I believe in what God promised our people long ago .
44026007	It is the promise that our 12 tribes are hoping to see come true . Because of this hope they serve God with a true and honest heart day and night . King Agrippa , it is also because of this hope that the Jews are bringing charges against me .
44026008	Why should any of you think it is impossible for God to raise the dead ?
44026009	" I myself believed that I should do everything I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	That's just what I was doing in Jerusalem . On the authority of the chief priests , I put many of God's people in prison . I agreed that they should die .
44026011	I often went from one synagogue to another to have them punished . I tried to force them to speak evil things against Jesus . I hated them so much that I even went to cities in other lands to hurt them .
44026012	" On one of these journeys I was on my way to Damascus . I had the authority and commission of the chief priests .
44026013	About noon , King Agrippa , I was on the road . I saw a light coming from heaven . It was brighter than the sun . It was shining around me and my companions .
44026014	We all fell to the ground . I heard a voice speak to me in the Aramaic language . ' Saul ! Saul ! ' it said . ' Why are you opposing me ? It is hard for you to go against what you know is right . '
44026015	" Then I asked , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' " ' I am Jesus , ' the Lord replied . ' I am the one you are opposing .
44026016	Now get up . Stand on your feet . I have appeared to you to appoint you to serve me and be my witness . You will tell others that you have seen me today . You will also tell them that I will show myself to you again .
44026017	" ' I will save you from your own people and from those who aren't Jews . I am sending you to them
44026018	to open their eyes . I want you to turn them from darkness to light . I want you to turn them from Satan's power to God . I want their sins to be forgiven . They will be forgiven when they believe in me . They will have their place among God's people . '
44026019	" So then , King Agrippa , I obeyed the vision that appeared from heaven .
44026020	First I preached to people in Damascus . Then I preached in Jerusalem and in all Judea . I preached also to people who are not Jews . I told them to turn away from their sins to God . The way they live must prove that they have turned away from their sins .
44026021	That's why the Jews grabbed me in the temple courtyard and tried to kill me .
44026022	" But God has helped me to this very day . So I stand here and give witness to both small and great . I have been saying nothing different from what the prophets and Moses said would happen .
44026023	They said the Christ would suffer . He would be the first to rise from the dead . He would announce the light of life to his own people and to those who aren't Jews . "
44026024	While Paul was still speaking up for himself , Festus interrupted . " You are out of your mind , Paul ! " he shouted . " Your great learning is driving you crazy ! "
44026025	" I am not crazy , most excellent Festus , " Paul replied . " What I am saying is true and reasonable .
44026026	The king is familiar with these things . So I can speak openly to him . I am certain he knows everything that has been going on . After all , it was not done in secret .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know you do . "
44026028	Then Agrippa spoke to Paul . " Are you trying to talk me into becoming a Christian ? " he said . " Do you think you can do that in such a short time ? "
44026029	Paul replied , " I don't care if it takes a short time or a long time . I pray to God for you and all who are listening to me today . I pray that you may become like me , except for these chains . "
44026030	The king stood up . The governor and Bernice and those sitting with them stood up too .
44026031	They left the room and began to talk with one another . " Why should this man die or be put in prison ? " they said . " He has done nothing worthy of that ! "
44026032	Agrippa said to Festus , " This man could have been set free . But he has made an appeal to Caesar . "
44027001	It was decided that we would sail for Italy . Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a Roman commander named Julius . He belonged to the Imperial Guard .
44027002	We boarded a ship from Adramyttium . It was about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia Minor . We headed out to sea . Aristarchus was with us . He was a Macedonian from Thessalonica .
44027003	The next day we landed at Sidon . There Julius was kind to Paul . He let Paul visit his friends so they could give him what he needed .
44027004	From there we headed out to sea again . We passed the calmer side of Cyprus because the winds were against us .
44027005	We sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia . Then we landed at Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the commander found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy . He put us on board .
44027007	We moved along slowly for many days . We had trouble getting to Cnidus . The wind did not let us stay on course . So we passed the calmer side of Crete , opposite Salmone .
44027008	It was not easy to sail along the coast . Then we came to a place called Fair Havens . It was near the town of Lasea .
44027009	A lot of time had passed . Sailing had already become dangerous . By now it was after the Day of Atonement , a day of fasting . So Paul gave them a warning .
44027010	" Men , " he said , " I can see that our trip is going to be dangerous . The ship and everything in it will be lost . Our own lives will be in danger also . "
44027011	But the commander didn't listen to what Paul said . Instead , he followed the advice of the pilot and the ship's owner .
44027012	The harbor wasn't a good place for ships to stay during winter . So most of the people decided we should sail on . They hoped we would reach Phoenix . They wanted to spend the winter there . Phoenix was a harbor in Crete . It faced both southwest and northwest .
44027013	A gentle south wind began to blow . They thought that this was what they had been waiting for . So they pulled up the anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete .
44027014	Before very long , a wind blew down from the island . It had the force of a hurricane . It was called a " northeaster . "
44027015	The ship was caught by the storm . We could not keep it sailing into the wind . So we gave up and were driven along .
44027016	We passed the calmer side of a small island called Cauda . We almost lost the lifeboat .
44027017	So the men lifted it on board . Then they tied ropes under the ship itself to hold it together . They were afraid it would get stuck on the sandbars of Syrtis . They lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along .
44027018	We took a very bad beating from the storm . The next day the crew began to throw the ship's contents overboard .
44027019	On the third day , they even threw the ship's gear overboard with their own hands .
44027020	The sun and stars didn't appear for many days . The storm was terrible . So we gave up all hope of being saved .
44027021	The men had not eaten for a long time . Paul stood up in front of them . " Men , " he said , " you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete . Then you would have avoided this harm and loss .
44027022	" Now I beg you to be brave . Not one of you will die . Only the ship will be destroyed .
44027023	I belong to God and serve him . Last night his angel stood beside me .
44027024	The angel said , ' Do not be afraid , Paul . You must go on trial in front of Caesar . God has shown his grace by sparing the lives of all those sailing with you . '
44027025	" Men , continue to be brave . I have faith in God . It will happen just as he told me .
44027026	But we must run the ship onto the beach of some island . "
44027027	On the 14th night we were still being driven across the Sea of Adria . About midnight the sailors had a feeling that they were approaching land .
44027028	They measured how deep the water was . They found that it was 120 feet deep . A short time later they measured the water again . This time it was 90 feet deep .
44027029	They were afraid we would crash against the rocks . So they dropped four anchors from the back of the ship . They prayed that daylight would come .
44027030	The sailors wanted to escape from the ship . So they let the lifeboat down into the sea . They pretended they were going to lower some anchors from the front of the ship .
44027031	But Paul spoke to the commander and the soldiers . " These men must stay with the ship , " he said . " If they don't , you can't be saved . "
44027032	So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat . They let it drift away .
44027033	Just before dawn Paul tried to get them all to eat . " For the last 14 days , " he said , " you have wondered what would happen . You have gone without food . You haven't eaten anything .
44027034	Now I am asking you to eat some food . You need it to live . Not one of you will lose a single hair from your head . "
44027035	After Paul said this , he took some bread and gave thanks to God . He did this where they all could see him . Then he broke it and began to eat .
44027036	All of them were filled with hope . So they ate some food .
44027037	There were 276 of us on board .
44027038	They ate as much as they wanted . They needed to make the ship lighter . So they threw the rest of the grain into the sea .
44027039	When daylight came , they saw a bay with a sandy beach . They didn't recognize the place . But they decided to run the ship onto the beach if they could .
44027040	So they cut the anchors loose and left them in the sea . At the same time , they untied the ropes that held the rudders . They lifted the sail at the front of the ship to the wind . Then they headed for the beach .
44027041	But the ship hit a sandbar . So the front of it got stuck and wouldn't move . The back of the ship was broken to pieces by the pounding of the waves .
44027042	The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners . They wanted to keep them from swimming away and escaping .
44027043	But the commander wanted to save Paul's life . So he kept the soldiers from carrying out their plan . He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and swim to land .
44027044	The rest were supposed to get there on boards or other pieces of the ship . That is how everyone reached land safely .
44028001	When we were safe on shore , we found out that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The people of the island were unusually kind . It was raining and cold . So they built a fire and welcomed all of us .
44028003	Paul gathered some sticks and put them on the fire . A poisonous snake was driven out by the heat . It fastened itself on Paul's hand .
44028004	The people of the island saw the snake hanging from his hand . They said to each other , " This man must be a murderer . He escaped from the sea . But Justice won't let him live . " Justice was the name of a goddess .
44028005	Paul shook the snake off into the fire . He was not harmed .
44028006	The people expected him to swell up . They thought he would suddenly fall dead . They waited for a long time . But they didn't see anything unusual happen to him . So they changed their minds . They said he was a god .
44028007	Publius owned property nearby . He was the chief official on the island . He welcomed us to his home . For three days he took care of us . He treated us with kindness .
44028008	His father was sick in bed . The man suffered from fever and dysentery . So Paul went in to see him . Paul prayed for him . He placed his hands on him and healed him .
44028009	Then the rest of the sick people on the island came . They too were healed .
44028010	The people of the island honored us in many ways . When we were ready to sail , they gave us the supplies we needed .
44028011	After three months we headed out to sea . We sailed in a ship that had stayed at the island during the winter . It was a ship from Alexandria . On the front of it the figures of twin gods were carved . Their names were Castor and Pollux .
44028012	We landed at Syracuse and stayed there for three days .
44028013	From there we sailed to Rhegium . The next day the south wind came up . The day after that , we reached Puteoli .
44028014	There we found some believers . They invited us to spend a week with them . At last we came to Rome .
44028015	The brothers and sisters there had heard we were coming . They traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us . When Paul saw these people , he thanked God and was cheered up .
44028016	When we got to Rome , Paul was allowed to live by himself . But a soldier guarded him .
44028017	Three days later Paul called a meeting of the Jewish leaders . So they came . Paul said to them , " My brothers , I have done nothing against our people . I have also done nothing against what our people of long ago practiced . But I was arrested in Jerusalem . I was handed over to the Romans .
44028018	" They questioned me . And they wanted to let me go . They saw I wasn't guilty of any crime worthy of death .
44028019	But the Jews objected . So I had to make an appeal to Caesar . " It wasn't that I had anything against my own people .
44028020	I share Israel's hope . That is why I am held with this chain . So I have asked to see you and talk with you . "
44028021	They replied , " We have not received any letters from Judea about you . None of our companions who came from there has reported or said anything bad about you .
44028022	But we want to hear what your ideas are . We know that people everywhere are talking against those who believe as you do . "
44028023	They decided to meet Paul on a certain day . At that time even more people came to the place where he was staying . From morning until evening , he told them about God's kingdom and explained it to them . Using the Law of Moses and the Prophets , he tried to get them to believe in Jesus .
44028024	Some believed what he said . Others did not .
44028025	They didn't agree with each other . They began to leave after Paul had made a final statement . He said , " The Holy Spirit was right when he spoke to your people long ago . Through Isaiah the prophet the Spirit said ,
44028026	" ' Go to your people . Say to them , " You will hear but never understand . You will see but never know what you are seeing . "
44028027	These people's hearts have become stubborn . They can barely hear with their ears . They have closed their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes . They might hear with their ears . They might understand with their hearts . They might turn , and then I would heal them . '
44028030	For two whole years Paul stayed there in a house he rented . He welcomed all who came to see him .
44028031	He preached boldly about God's kingdom . No one could keep him from teaching people about the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I serve Christ Jesus . I have been appointed to be an apostle . God set me apart to tell others his good news .
45001002	He promised the good news long ago . He announced it through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures .
45001003	The good news is about God's Son . As a human being , the Son of God belonged to King David's family line .
45001004	By the power of the Holy Spirit , he was appointed to be the mighty Son of God because he rose from the dead . He is Jesus Christ our Lord .
45001005	I received God's grace because of what Jesus did so that I could bring glory to him . He made me an apostle to all those who aren't Jews . I must invite them to have faith in God and obey him .
45001006	You also are among those who are appointed to belong to Jesus Christ .
45001007	I am sending this letter to all of you in Rome who are loved by God and appointed to be his people . May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
45001008	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you . People all over the world are talking about your faith .
45001009	I serve God with my whole heart . I preach the good news about his Son . God knows that I always remember you
45001010	in my prayers . I pray that now at last it may be God's plan to open the way for me to visit you .
45001011	I long to see you . I want to make you strong by giving you a gift from the Holy Spirit .
45001012	I want us to cheer each other up by sharing our faith .
45001013	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that I planned many times to visit you . But until now I have been kept from coming . My work has produced results among others who are not Jews . In the same way , I want to see results among you .
45001014	I have a duty both to Greeks and to non-Greeks . I have a duty both to wise people and to foolish people .
45001015	So I really want to preach the good news also to you who live in Rome .
45001016	I am not ashamed of the good news . It is God's power . And it will save everyone who believes . It is meant first for the Jews . It is meant also for those who aren't Jews .
45001017	The good news shows how God makes people right with himself . From beginning to end , becoming right with God depends on a person's faith . It is written , " Those who are right with God will live by faith . "
45001018	God shows his anger from heaven . It is against all the godless and evil things people do . They are so evil that they say no to the truth .
45001019	The truth about God is plain to them . God has made it plain .
45001020	Ever since the world was created it has been possible to see the qualities of God that are not seen . I'm talking about his eternal power and about the fact that he is God . Those things can be seen in what he has made . So people have no excuse for what they do .
45001021	They knew God . But they didn't honor him as God . They didn't thank him . Their thinking became worthless . Their foolish hearts became dark .
45001022	They claimed to be wise . But they made fools of themselves .
45001023	They would rather have statues of gods than the glorious God who lives forever . Their statues of gods are made to look like people , birds , animals and reptiles .
45001024	So God let them go . He allowed them to do what their sinful hearts wanted to . He let them commit sexual sins . They polluted one another's bodies by what they did .
45001025	They chose a lie instead of God's truth . They worshiped and served created things . They didn't worship the Creator . But he must be praised forever . Amen .
45001026	So God let them go . They were filled with shameful longings . Their women committed sexual acts that were not natural .
45001027	In the same way , the men turned away from their natural love for women . They burned with sexual longing for each other . Men did shameful things with other men . They suffered in their bodies for all the twisted things they did .
45001028	They didn't think it was important to know God . So God let them go . He allowed them to have dirty minds . They did things they shouldn't do .
45001029	They are full of every kind of sin , evil and ungodliness . They want more than they need . They commit murder . They want what belongs to other people . They fight and cheat . They hate others . They say mean things about other people .
45001030	They tell lies about them . They hate God . They are rude and proud . They brag . They think of new ways to do evil . They don't obey their parents .
45001031	They are foolish . They can't be trusted . They are not loving and kind .
45001032	They know that God's commands are right . They know that those who do evil things should die . But they continue to do those very things . They also approve of others who do them .
45002001	If you judge someone else , you have no excuse for it . When you judge another person , you are judging yourself . You do the same things you blame others for doing .
45002002	We know that when God judges those who do evil things , he judges fairly .
45002003	Though you are only a human being , you judge others . But you yourself do the same things . So how do you think you will escape when God judges you ?
45002004	Do you make fun of God's great kindness and favor ? Do you make fun of God when he is patient with you ? Don't you realize that God's kindness is meant to turn you away from your sins ?
45002005	But you are stubborn . In your heart you are not sorry for your sins . You are storing up anger against yourself . The day of God's anger is coming . Then his way of judging fairly will be shown .
45002006	God " will give to each person in keeping with what he has done . "
45002007	God will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good . They want glory , honor , and life that never ends .
45002008	But there are others who only look out for themselves . They don't accept the truth . They go down an evil path . God will pour out his burning anger on them .
45002009	There will be trouble and suffering for everyone who does evil . That is meant first for the Jews . It is also meant for the non-Jews .
45002010	But there will be glory , honor and peace for everyone who does good . That is meant first for the Jews . It is also meant for the non-Jews .
45002011	God treats everyone the same .
45002012	Some people do not know God's law when they sin . They will not be judged by the law when they die . Others do know God's law when they sin . They will be judged by the law .
45002013	Hearing the law does not make a person right with God . People are considered to be right with God only when they obey the law .
45002014	Those who aren't Jews do not have the law . Sometimes they just naturally do what the law requires . They are a law for themselves . This is true even though they don't have the law .
45002015	They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts . The way their minds judge them gives witness to that fact . Sometimes their thoughts find them guilty . At other times their thoughts find them not guilty .
45002016	People will be judged on the day God appoints Jesus Christ to judge their secret thoughts . That's part of my good news .
45002017	Suppose you call yourself a Jew . You trust in the law . You brag that you are close to God .
45002018	You know what God wants . You agree with what is best because the law teaches you .
45002019	You are sure you can lead people who are blind . You are sure you are a light for those who are in the dark .
45002020	You claim to be able to teach foolish people . You can even teach babies . You think that in the law you have all knowledge and truth .
45002021	You teach others . But you don't teach yourself ! You preach against stealing . But you steal !
45002022	You say that people should not commit adultery . But you commit adultery ! You hate statues of gods . But you rob temples !
45002023	You brag about the law . But when you break it , you rob God of his honor !
45002024	It is written , " Those who aren't Jews say evil things against God's name because of you . "
45002025	Circumcision has value if you obey the law . But if you break the law , it is just as if you hadn't been circumcised .
45002026	Sometimes those who aren't circumcised do what the law requires . Won't God accept them as if they had been circumcised ?
45002027	Many are not circumcised physically , but they obey the law . They will prove that you are guilty . You are breaking the law , even though you have the written law and are circumcised .
45002028	A man is not a Jew if he is a Jew only on the outside . And circumcision is more than just something done to the outside of a man's body .
45002029	No , a man is a Jew only if he is a Jew on the inside . And true circumcision means that the heart has been circumcised . It is done by the Holy Spirit . It is more than just obeying the written Law . Then a man's praise will not come from others . It will come from God .
45003001	Is there any advantage in being a Jew ? Is there any value in being circumcised ?
45003002	There is great value in every way ! First of all , the Jews have been given the very words of God .
45003003	What if some Jews did not believe ? Will the fact that they don't have faith keep God from being faithful ?
45003004	Not at all ! God is true , even though every human being is a liar . It is written , " You are right when you sentence me . You are fair when you judge me . "
45003005	Doesn't the fact that we are wrong prove more clearly that God is right ? Then what can we say ? Can we say that God is not fair when he brings his anger down on us ? As you can tell , I am just using human ways of thinking .
45003006	God is certainly fair ! If he weren't , how could he judge the world ?
45003007	Someone might argue , " When I lie , it becomes clearer that God is truthful . It makes his glory shine more brightly . Why then does he find me guilty of sin ? "
45003008	Why not say , " Let's do evil things so that good things will happen " ? Some people actually lie by reporting that this is what we say . They are the ones who should be found guilty .
45003009	What should we say then ? Are we Jews any better ? Not at all ! We have already claimed that Jews are sinners . The same is true of those who aren't Jews .
45003010	It is written , " No one is right with God , no one at all .
45003011	No one understands . No one trusts in God .
45003012	All of them have turned away . They have all become worthless . No one does anything good , no one at all . "
45003013	" Their throats are like open graves . With their tongues they tell lies . " " The words from their lips are like the poison of a snake . "
45003014	" Their mouths are full of curses and bitterness . "
45003015	" They run quickly to commit murder .
45003016	They leave a trail of failure and pain .
45003017	They do not know the way of peace . "
45003018	" They don't have any respect for God . "
45003019	What the law says , it says to those who are ruled by the law . Its purpose is to shut every mouth and make the whole world accountable to God .
45003020	So it can't be said that anyone will be made right with God by obeying the law . Not at all ! The law makes us more aware of our sin .
45003021	But now God has shown us how to become right with him . The Law and the Prophets give witness to this . It has nothing to do with obeying the law .
45003022	We are made right with God by putting our faith in Jesus Christ . That happens to all who believe . It is no different for the Jews than for anyone else .
45003023	Everyone has sinned . No one measures up to God's glory .
45003024	The free gift of God's grace makes all of us right with him . Christ Jesus paid the price to set us free .
45003025	God gave him as a sacrifice to pay for sins . So he forgives the sins of those who have faith in his blood . God did all of that to prove that he is fair . Because of his mercy he did not punish people for the sins they had committed before Jesus died for them .
45003026	God did that to prove in our own time that he is fair . He proved that he is right . He also made right with himself those who believe in Jesus .
45003027	So who can brag ? No one ! Are people saved by obeying the law ? Not at all ! They are saved because of their faith .
45003028	We firmly believe that people are made right with God because of their faith . They are not saved by obeying the law .
45003029	Is God the God of Jews only ? Isn't he also the God of those who aren't Jews ? Yes , he is their God too .
45003030	There is only one God . When those who are circumcised believe in him , he makes them right with himself . When those who are not circumcised believe in him , he also makes them right with himself .
45003031	Does faith make the law useless ? Not at all ! We agree with the law .
45004001	What should we say about those things ? What did our father Abraham discover about being right with God ?
45004002	Did he become right with God because of something he did ? If so , he could brag about it . But he couldn't brag to God .
45004003	What do we find in Scripture ? It says , " Abraham believed God . God accepted Abraham's faith , and so his faith made him right with God . "
45004004	When a man works , his pay is not considered a gift . It is owed to him .
45004005	But things are different with God . He makes evil people right with himself . If people trust in him , their faith is accepted even though they do not work . Their faith makes them right with God .
45004006	King David says the same thing . He tells us how blessed some people are . God makes those people right with himself . But they don't have to do anything in return . David says ,
45004007	" Blessed are those whose lawless acts are forgiven . Blessed are those whose sins are taken away .
45004008	Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord never counts against him . "
45004009	Is that blessing only for those who are circumcised ? Or is it also for those who are not circumcised ? We have been saying that God accepted Abraham's faith , and so his faith made him right with God .
45004010	When did it happen ? Was it after Abraham was circumcised , or before ? It was before he was circumcised , not after !
45004011	He was circumcised as a sign of the covenant God had made with him . It showed that his faith had made him right with God before he was circumcised . So Abraham is the father of all believers who have not been circumcised . God accepts their faith . So their faith makes them right with him .
45004012	Abraham is also the father of the circumcised who believe . So just being circumcised is not enough . Those who are circumcised must also follow the steps of our father Abraham . He had faith before he was circumcised .
45004013	Abraham and his family received a promise . God promised that Abraham would receive the world . It would not come to him because he obeyed the law . It would come because of his faith , which made him right with God .
45004014	Do those who obey the law receive the promise ? If they do , faith would have no value . God's promise would be worthless .
45004015	The law brings God's anger . Where there is no law , the law can't be broken .
45004016	The promise is based on God's grace . The promise comes by faith . All of Abraham's children will certainly receive the promise . And it is not only for those who are ruled by the law . Those who have the same faith that Abraham had are also included . He is the father of us all .
45004017	It is written , " I have made you a father of many nations . " God considers Abraham to be our father . The God that Abraham believed in gives life to the dead . Abraham's God also speaks of things that do not exist as if they do exist .
45004018	When there was no reason for hope , Abraham believed because he had hope . He became the father of many nations , exactly as God had promised . God said , " That is how many children you will have . "
45004019	Without becoming weak in his faith , Abraham accepted the fact that he was past the time when he could have children . At that time he was about 100 years old . He also realized that Sarah was too old to have children .
45004020	But he kept believing in God's promise . He became strong in his faith . He gave glory to God .
45004021	He was absolutely sure that God had the power to do what he had promised .
45004022	That's why " God accepted Abraham because he believed . So his faith made him right with God . "
45004023	The words " God accepted Abraham's faith " were written not only for Abraham .
45004024	They were written also for us . We believe in the God who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead . So God will accept our faith and make us right with himself .
45004025	Jesus was handed over to die for our sins . He was raised to life in order to make us right with God .
45005001	We have been made right with God because of our faith . Now we have peace with him because of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45005002	Through faith in Jesus we have received God's grace . In that grace we stand . We are full of joy because we expect to share in God's glory .
45005003	And that's not all . We are full of joy even when we suffer . We know that our suffering gives us the strength to go on .
45005004	The strength to go on produces character . Character produces hope .
45005005	And hope will never let us down . God has poured his love into our hearts . He did it through the Holy Spirit , whom he has given to us .
45005006	At just the right time Christ died for ungodly people . He died for us when we had no power of our own .
45005007	It is unusual for anyone to die for a godly person . Maybe someone would be willing to die for a good person .
45005008	But here is how God has shown his love for us . While we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
45005009	The blood of Christ has made us right with God . So we are even more sure that Jesus will save us from God's anger .
45005010	Once we were God's enemies . But we have been brought back to him because his Son has died for us . Now that God has brought us back , we are even more secure . We know that we will be saved because Christ lives .
45005011	And that is not all . We are full of joy in God because of our Lord Jesus Christ . Because of him , God has brought us back to himself .
45005012	Sin entered the world because one man sinned . And death came because of sin . Everyone sinned , so death came to all people .
45005013	Before the law was given , sin was in the world . But sin is not judged when there is no law .
45005014	Death ruled from the time of Adam to the time of Moses . Death ruled even over those who did not sin as Adam did . He broke God's command . But he also became a pattern of the One who was going to come .
45005015	God's gift is different from Adam's sin . Many people died because of the sin of that one man . But it was even more sure that God's grace would also come through one man . That man is Jesus Christ . God's gift of grace was more than enough for the whole world .
45005016	The result of God's gift is different from the result of Adam's sin . God judged one sin . That brought guilt . But after many sins , God's gift made people right with him .
45005017	One man sinned , and death ruled because of his sin . But we are even more sure of what will happen because of what the one man , Jesus Christ , has done . Those who receive the rich supply of God's grace will rule with Christ in his kingdom . They have received God's gift and have been made right with him .
45005018	One man's sin brought guilt to all people . So also one right act made all people right with God . And all who are right with God will live .
45005019	Many people were made sinners because one man did not obey . But one man did obey . That is why many people will be made right with God .
45005020	The law was given so that sin would increase . But where sin increased , God's grace increased even more .
45005021	Sin ruled because of death . So also grace rules in the lives of those who are right with God . The grace of God brings eternal life because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done .
45006001	What should we say then ? Should we keep on sinning so that God's grace can increase ?
45006002	Not at all ! As far as sin is concerned , we are dead . So how can we keep on sinning ?
45006003	All of us were baptized into Christ Jesus . Don't you know that we were baptized into his death ?
45006004	By being baptized , we were buried with Christ into his death . Christ has been raised from the dead by the Father's glory . And like Christ we also can live a new life .
45006005	By being baptized , we have been joined with him in his death . We will certainly also be joined with him in his resurrection .
45006006	We know that what we used to be was nailed to the cross with him . That happened so our sinful bodies would lose their power . We are no longer slaves of sin .
45006007	Those who have died have been set free from sin .
45006008	We died with Christ . So we believe that we will also live with him .
45006009	We know that Christ was raised from the dead and will never die again . Death doesn't control him anymore .
45006010	When he died , he died once and for all time as far as sin is concerned . Now that he lives , he lives as far as God is concerned .
45006011	In the same way , consider yourselves to be dead as far as sin is concerned . Now that you believe in Christ Jesus , consider yourselves to be alive as far as God is concerned .
45006012	So don't let sin rule your body , which is going to die . Don't obey its evil longings .
45006013	Don't give the parts of your body to serve sin . Don't let them be used to do evil . Instead , give yourselves to God . You have been brought from death to life . Give the parts of your body to him to do what is right .
45006014	Sin will not be your master . Law does not rule you . God's grace has set you free .
45006015	What should we say then ? Should we sin because we are not ruled by law but by God's grace ? Not at all !
45006016	Don't you know that when you give yourselves to obey someone you become that person's slave ? You can be slaves of sin . Then you will die . Or you can be slaves who obey God . Then you will live a godly life .
45006017	You used to be slaves of sin . But thank God that with your whole heart you obeyed the teachings you were given !
45006018	You have been set free from sin . You have become slaves to right living .
45006019	Because you are human , you find this hard to understand . So I have said it in a way that will help you understand it . You used to give the parts of your body to be slaves to unclean living . You were becoming more and more evil . Now give your bodies to be slaves to right living . Then you will become holy .
45006020	Once you were slaves of sin . At that time right living did not control you .
45006021	What benefit did you gain from doing the things you are now ashamed of ? Those things lead to death !
45006022	You have been set free from sin . God has made you his slaves . The benefit you gain leads to holy living . And the end result is eternal life .
45006023	When you sin , the pay you get is death . But God gives you the gift of eternal life because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done .
45007001	Brothers and sisters , I am speaking to you who know the law . Don't you know that the law has authority over us only as long as we are alive ?
45007002	For example , by law a married woman is joined to her husband as long as he is living . But suppose her husband dies . Then the marriage law no longer applies to her .
45007003	But suppose that married woman gets married again while her husband is still alive . Then she is called a woman who commits adultery . But suppose her husband dies . Then she is free from that law . She is not guilty of adultery even if she marries another man .
45007004	My brothers and sisters , when Christ died you also died as far as the law is concerned . Then it became possible for you to belong to him . He was raised from the dead . Now our lives can be useful to God .
45007005	Our sinful nature used to control us . The law stirred up sinful longings in our bodies . So the things we did resulted in death .
45007006	But now we have died to what used to control us . We have been set free from the law . Now we serve in the new way of the Holy Spirit . We no longer serve in the old way of the written law .
45007007	What should we say then ? That the law is sin ? Not at all ! I wouldn't have known what sin was unless the law had told me . The law said , " Do not want what belongs to other people . " If the law hadn't said that , I would not have known what it was like to want what belonged to others .
45007008	But the commandment gave sin an opportunity . Sin caused me to want all kinds of things that belonged to others . No one can break a law that doesn't exist .
45007009	Before I knew about the law , I was alive . But then the commandment came . Sin came to life , and I died .
45007010	I found that the commandment that was supposed to bring life actually brought death .
45007011	When the commandment gave sin the opportunity , sin tricked me . It used the commandment to put me to death .
45007012	So the law is holy . The commandment also is holy and right and good .
45007013	Did what is good cause me to die ? Not at all ! Sin had to be recognized for what it really is . So it produced death in me through what was good . Because of the commandment , sin became totally sinful .
45007014	We know that the law is holy . But I am not . I have been sold to be a slave of sin .
45007015	I don't understand what I do . I don't do what I want to do . Instead , I do what I hate to do .
45007016	I do what I don't want to do . So I agree that the law is good .
45007017	As it is , I am no longer the one who does these things . It is sin living in me that does them .
45007018	I know there is nothing good in my sinful nature . I want to do what is good , but I can't .
45007019	I don't do the good things I want to do . I keep on doing the evil things I don't want to do .
45007020	I do what I don't want to do . But I am not really the one who is doing it . It is sin living in me .
45007021	Here is the law I find working in me . When I want to do good , evil is right there with me .
45007022	Deep inside me I find joy in God's law .
45007023	But I see another law working in the parts of my body . It fights against the law of my mind . It makes me a prisoner of the law of sin . That law controls the parts of my body .
45007024	What a terrible failure I am ! Who will save me from this sin that brings death to my body ?
45007025	I give thanks to God . He will do it through Jesus Christ our Lord . So in my mind I am a slave to God's law . But in my sinful nature I am a slave to the law of sin .
45008001	Those who belong to Christ Jesus are no longer under God's sentence .
45008002	I am now controlled by the law of the Holy Spirit . That law gives me life because of what Christ Jesus has done . It has set me free from the law of sin that brings death .
45008003	The written law was made weak by our sinful nature . But God did what the written law could not do . He made his Son to be like those who have a sinful nature . He sent him to be an offering for sin . In that way , he judged sin in his Son's human body .
45008004	Now we can do everything the law requires . Our sinful nature no longer controls the way we live . The Holy Spirit now controls the way we live .
45008005	Don't live under the control of your sinful nature . If you do , you will think about what your sinful nature wants . Live under the control of the Holy Spirit . If you do , you will think about what the Spirit wants .
45008006	The way a sinful person thinks leads to death . But the mind controlled by the Spirit brings life and peace .
45008007	The sinful mind is at war with God . It does not obey God's law . It can't .
45008008	Those who are controlled by their sinful nature can't please God .
45008009	But your sinful nature does not control you . The Holy Spirit controls you . The Spirit of God lives in you . Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ .
45008010	Christ lives in you . So your body is dead because of sin . But your spirit is alive because you have been made right with God .
45008011	The Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you . So the God who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your bodies , which are going to die . He will do this by the power of his Spirit , who lives in you .
45008012	Brothers and sisters , we have a duty . Our duty is not to live under the control of our sinful nature .
45008013	If you live under the control of your sinful nature , you will die . But by the power of the Holy Spirit you can put to death the sins your body commits . Then you will live .
45008014	Those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God .
45008015	You didn't receive a spirit that makes you a slave to fear once again . Instead you received the Holy Spirit , who makes you God's child . By the Spirit's power we call God " Abba . " Abba means Father .
45008016	The Spirit himself joins with our spirits . Together they give witness that we are God's children .
45008017	As his children , we will receive all that he has for us . We will share what Christ receives . But we must share in his sufferings if we want to share in his glory .
45008018	What we are suffering now is nothing compared with the glory that will be shown in us .
45008019	Everything God created looks forward to the time when his children will appear in their full and final glory .
45008020	The created world was bound to fail . But that was not the result of its own choice . It was planned that way by the One who made it . God planned
45008021	to set the created world free . He didn't want it to rot away completely . Instead , he wanted it to have the same glorious freedom that his children have .
45008022	We know that all that God created has been groaning . It is in pain as if it were giving birth to a child . The created world continues to groan even now .
45008023	And that's not all . We have the Holy Spirit as the promise of future blessing . But we also groan inside ourselves as we look forward to the time when God will adopt us as full members of his family . Then he will give us everything he has for us . He will raise our bodies and give glory to them .
45008024	That's the hope we had when we were saved . But hope that can be seen is no hope at all . Who hopes for what he already has ?
45008025	We hope for what we don't have yet . So we are patient as we wait for it .
45008026	In the same way , the Holy Spirit helps us when we are weak . We don't know what we should pray for . But the Spirit himself prays for us . He prays with groans too deep for words .
45008027	God , who looks into our hearts , knows the mind of the Spirit . And the Spirit prays for God's people just as God wants him to pray .
45008028	We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him . He appointed them to be saved in keeping with his purpose .
45008029	God planned that those he had chosen would become like his Son . In that way , Christ will be the first and most honored among many brothers .
45008030	And those God has planned for , he has also appointed to be saved . Those he has appointed , he has made right with himself . To those he has made right with himself , he has given his glory .
45008031	What should we say then ? Since God is on our side , who can be against us ?
45008032	God did not spare his own Son . He gave him up for us all . Then won't he also freely give us everything else ?
45008033	Who can bring any charge against God's chosen ones ? God makes us right with himself .
45008034	Who can sentence us to death ? Christ Jesus is at the right hand of God and is also praying for us . He died . More than that , he was raised to life .
45008035	Who can separate us from Christ's love ? Can trouble or hard times or harm or hunger ? Can nakedness or danger or war ?
45008036	It is written , " Because of you , we face death all day long . We are considered as sheep to be killed . "
45008037	No ! In all these things we will do even more than win ! We owe it all to Christ , who has loved us .
45008038	I am absolutely sure that not even death or life can separate us from God's love . Not even angels or demons , the present or the future , or any powers can do that .
45008039	Not even the highest places or the lowest , or anything else in all creation can do that . Nothing at all can ever separate us from God's love because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done .
45009001	I speak the truth in Christ . I am not lying . My mind tells me that what I say is true . It is guided by the Holy Spirit .
45009002	My heart is full of sorrow . My sadness never ends .
45009003	I am so concerned about my people , who are members of my own race . I am ready to be cursed , if that would help them . I am even willing to be separated from Christ .
45009004	They are the people of Israel . They have been adopted as God's children . God's glory belongs to them . So do the covenants . They received the law . They were taught to worship in the temple . They were given the promises .
45009005	The founders of our nation belong to them . Christ comes from their family line . He is God over all . May he always be praised ! Amen .
45009006	Their condition does not mean that God's word has failed . Not everyone in the family line of Israel really belongs to Israel .
45009007	Not everyone in Abraham's family line is really his child . Not at all ! Scripture says , " Your family line will continue through Isaac . "
45009008	In other words , God's children are not just Abraham's natural children . Instead , they are the children God promised to him . They are the ones considered to be Abraham's children .
45009009	God promised , " I will return at the appointed time . Sarah will have a son . "
45009010	And that's not all . Rebekah's children had the same father . He was our father Isaac .
45009011	Here is what happened . Rebekah's twins had not even been born . They hadn't done anything good or bad yet . So they show that God's purpose is based firmly on his free choice .
45009012	It was not because of anything they did but because of God's choice . So Rebekah was told , " The older son will serve the younger one . "
45009013	It is written , " I chose Jacob instead of Esau . "
45009014	What should we say then ? Is God unfair ? Not at all !
45009015	He said to Moses , " I will have mercy on whom I have mercy . I will show love to those I love . "
45009016	So it doesn't depend on what we want or do . It depends on God's mercy .
45009017	In Scripture , God says to Pharaoh , " I had a special reason for making you king . I decided to use you to show my power . I wanted my name to become known everywhere on earth . "
45009018	So God does what he wants to do . He shows mercy to one person and makes another stubborn .
45009019	One of you will say to me , " Then why does God still blame us ? Who can oppose what he wants to do ? "
45009020	But you are a mere man . So who are you to talk back to God ? Scripture says , " Can what is made say to the one who made it , ' Why did you make me like this ? ' "
45009021	Isn't the potter free to make different kinds of pots out of the same lump of clay ? Some are for special purposes . Others are for ordinary use .
45009022	What if God chose to show his great anger ? What if he chose to make his power known ? That is why he put up with people he was angry with . They had been made to be destroyed .
45009023	What if he did that to show the riches of his glory to others ? Those are the people he shows his mercy to . He had prepared them to receive his glory .
45009024	We are those people . He has chosen us . We do not come only from the Jewish race . Many of us are not Jews .
45009025	God says in Hosea , " I will call those who are not my people ' my people . ' I will call the one who is not my loved one ' my loved one . ' "
45009026	He also says , " Once it was said to them , ' You are not my people . ' In that very place they will be called ' children of the living God . ' "
45009027	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel . He says , " The number of people from Israel may be like the sand by the sea . But only a few of them will be saved .
45009028	The Lord will carry out his sentence . He will be quick to carry it out on earth , once and for all . "
45009029	Earlier Isaiah had said , " The Lord who rules over all left us children and grandchildren . If he hadn't , we would have become like Sodom . We would have been like Gomorrah . "
45009030	What should we say then ? Those who aren't Jews did not look for a way to be right with God . But they found it by having faith .
45009031	Israel did look for a law that could make them right with God . But they didn't find it .
45009032	Why not ? Because they didn't look for it by faith . They tried to get it by working for it . They tripped over the stone that causes people to trip and fall .
45009033	It is written , " Look ! In Zion I am laying a stone that causes people to trip . It is a rock that makes them fall . The one who trusts in him will never be put to shame . "
45010001	Brothers and sisters , with all my heart I long for the people of Israel to be saved . I pray to God for them .
45010002	I can give witness about them that they really want to serve God . But how they are trying to do it is not based on what they know .
45010003	They didn't know how God makes people right with himself . They tried to get right with God in their own way . They didn't do it in God's way .
45010004	Christ has completed the law . So now everyone who believes can be right with God .
45010005	Moses explained how the law could help a person do what God requires . He said , " The one who does those things will live by them . "
45010006	But the way to do what God requires must begin by having faith in him . Scripture says , " Do not say in your heart , ' Who will go up into heaven ? ' " That means to go up into heaven and bring Christ down .
45010007	" And do not say , ' Who will go down into the grave ? ' " That means to bring Christ up from the dead .
45010008	But what does it say ? " The word is near you . It's in your mouth and in your heart . " That means the word we are preaching . You must put your faith in it .
45010009	Say with your mouth , " Jesus is Lord . " Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead . Then you will be saved .
45010010	With your heart you believe and are made right with God . With your mouth you say that Jesus is Lord . And so you are saved .
45010011	Scripture says , " The one who trusts in him will never be put to shame . "
45010012	There is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not . The same Lord is Lord of all . He richly blesses everyone who calls on him .
45010013	Scripture says , " Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . "
45010014	How can they call on him unless they believe in him ? How can they believe in him unless they hear about him ? How can they hear about him unless someone preaches to them ?
45010015	And how can anyone preach without being sent ? It is written , " How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news ! "
45010016	But not all the people of Israel accepted the good news . Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our message ? "
45010017	So faith comes from hearing the message . And the message that is heard is the word of Christ .
45010018	But I ask , " Didn't the people of Israel hear ? " Of course they did . It is written , " Their voice has gone out into the whole earth . Their words have gone out from one end of the world to the other . "
45010019	Again I ask , " Didn't Israel understand ? " First , Moses says , " I will use people who are not a nation to make you jealous . I will use a nation that has no understanding to make you angry . "
45010020	Then Isaiah boldly speaks about what God says . God said , " I was found by those who were not trying to find me . I made myself known to those who were not asking for me . "
45010021	But Isaiah also speaks about what God says concerning Israel . God said , " All day long I have held out my hands . I have held them out to a stubborn people who do not obey me . "
45011001	So here is what I ask . Did God turn his back on his people ? Not at all ! I myself belong to Israel . I am one of Abraham's children . I am from the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God didn't turn his back on his people . After all , he chose them . Don't you know what Scripture says about Elijah ? He complained to God about Israel .
45011003	He said , " Lord , they have killed your prophets . They have torn down your altars . I'm the only one left . And they are trying to kill me . "
45011004	How did God answer him ? God said , " I have kept 7,000 people for myself . They have not bowed down to Baal . "
45011005	Some are also faithful today . They have been chosen by God's grace .
45011006	And if they are chosen by grace , it is no longer a matter of working for it . If it were , grace wouldn't be grace anymore .
45011007	What should we say then ? Israel did not receive what they wanted so badly . But those who were chosen did . God made the rest of them stubborn .
45011008	It is written , " God made it hard for them to understand . He gave them eyes that could not see . He gave them ears that could not hear . And they are still like that today . "
45011009	David says , " Let their feast be a trap and a snare . Let it make Israel trip and fall . Let Israel get what's coming to them .
45011010	Let their eyes grow dark so they can't see . Let their backs be bent forever . "
45011011	Again , here is what I ask . They didn't trip and fall once and for all time , did they ? Not at all ! Because Israel sinned , those who aren't Jews can be saved . That will make Israel jealous of them .
45011012	Israel's sin brought riches to the world . Their loss brought riches to the non-Jews . What greater riches will come when all Israel turns to God !
45011013	I am talking to you who are not Jews . I am the apostle to the non-Jews . So I think the work I do for God and others is very important .
45011014	I hope somehow to stir up my own people to want what you have . Perhaps I can save some of them .
45011015	When they were not accepted , it became possible for the whole world to be brought back to God . So what will happen when they are accepted ? It will be like life from the dead .
45011016	The first handful of dough that is offered is holy . This makes all of the dough holy . If the root is holy , so are the branches .
45011017	Some of the natural branches have been broken off . You are a wild olive branch . But you have been joined to the tree with the other branches . Now you enjoy the life-giving sap of the olive tree root .
45011018	So don't think you are better than the other branches . Remember , you don't give life to the root . The root gives life to you .
45011019	You will say , " Some branches were broken off so that I could be joined to the tree . "
45011020	That's true . But they were broken off because they didn't believe . You stand only because you do believe . So don't be proud . Be afraid .
45011021	God didn't spare the natural branches . He won't spare you either .
45011022	Think about how kind God is ! Also think about how firm he is ! He was hard on those who stopped following him . But he is kind to you . So you must continue to live in his kindness . If you don't , you also will be cut off .
45011023	If the people of Israel do not continue in their unbelief , they will again be joined to the tree . God is able to join them to the tree again .
45011024	After all , weren't you cut from a wild olive tree ? Weren't you joined to an olive tree that was taken care of ? And wasn't that the opposite of how things should be done ? How much more easily will the natural branches be joined to their own olive tree !
45011025	Brothers and sisters , here is a mystery I want you to understand . It will keep you from being proud . Part of Israel has refused to obey God . That will continue until the full number of non-Jews has entered God's kingdom .
45011026	And so all Israel will be saved . It is written , " The One who saves will come from Mount Zion . He will remove sin from Jacob .
45011027	Here is my covenant with them . I will take away their sins . "
45011028	As far as the good news is concerned , the people of Israel are enemies . That is for your good . But as far as God's choice is concerned , the people of Israel are loved . That is because of God's promises to the founders of our nation .
45011029	God does not take back his gifts . He does not change his mind about those he has chosen .
45011030	At one time you did not obey God . But now you have received mercy because Israel did not obey .
45011031	In the same way , Israel has not been obeying God . But now they receive mercy because of God's mercy to you .
45011032	God has found everyone guilty of not obeying him . So now he can have mercy on everyone .
45011033	How very rich are God's wisdom and knowledge ! How he judges is more than we can understand ! The way he deals with people is more than we can know !
45011034	" Who can ever know what is in the Lord's mind ? Or who can ever give him advice ? "
45011035	" Has anyone ever given anything to God , so that God has to pay him back ? "
45011036	All things come from him . All things are directed by him . All things are for his good . May God be given the glory forever ! Amen .
45012001	Brothers and sisters , God has shown you his mercy . So I am asking you to offer up your bodies to him while you are still alive . Your bodies are a holy sacrifice that is pleasing to God . When you offer your bodies to God , you are worshiping him .
45012002	Don't live any longer the way this world lives . Let your way of thinking be completely changed . Then you will be able to test what God wants for you . And you will agree that what he wants is right . His plan is good and pleasing and perfect .
45012003	God's grace has been given to me . So here is what I say to every one of you . Don't think of yourself more highly than you should . Be reasonable when you think about yourself . Keep in mind the amount of faith God has given you .
45012004	Each of us has one body with many parts . And the parts do not all have the same purpose .
45012005	So also we are many persons . But in Christ we are one body . And each part of the body belongs to all the other parts .
45012006	We all have gifts . They differ in keeping with the grace that God has given each of us . Do you have the gift of prophecy ? Then use it in keeping with the faith you have .
45012007	Is it your gift to serve ? Then serve . Is it teaching ? Then teach .
45012008	Is it telling others how they should live ? Then tell them . Is it giving to those who are in need ? Then give freely . Is it being a leader ? Then work hard at it . Is it showing mercy ? Then do it cheerfully .
45012009	Love must be honest and true . Hate what is evil . Hold on to what is good .
45012010	Love each other deeply . Honor others more than yourselves .
45012011	Never let the fire in your heart go out . Keep it alive . Serve the Lord .
45012012	When you hope , be joyful . When you suffer , be patient . When you pray , be faithful .
45012013	Share with God's people who are in need . Welcome others into your homes .
45012014	Bless those who hurt you . Bless them , and do not call down curses on them .
45012015	Be joyful with those who are joyful . Be sad with those who are sad .
45012016	Agree with each other . Don't be proud . Be willing to be a friend of people who aren't considered important . Don't think that you are better than others .
45012017	Don't pay back evil with evil . Be careful to do what everyone thinks is right .
45012018	If possible , live in peace with everyone . Do that as much as you can .
45012019	My friends , don't try to get even . Leave room for God to show his anger . It is written , " I am the One who judges people . I will pay them back , " says the Lord .
45012020	Do just the opposite . Scripture says , " If your enemies are hungry , give them food to eat . If they are thirsty , give them something to drink . By doing those things , you will pile up burning coals on their heads . "
45012021	Don't let evil overcome you . Overcome evil by doing good .
45013001	All of you must be willing to obey completely those who rule over you . There are no authorities except the ones God has chosen . Those who now rule have been chosen by God .
45013002	So when you oppose the authorities , you are opposing those whom God has appointed . Those who do that will be judged .
45013003	If you do what is right , you won't need to be afraid of your rulers . But watch out if you do what is wrong ! You don't want to be afraid of those in authority , do you ? Then do what is right . The one in authority will praise you .
45013004	He serves God and will do you good . But if you do wrong , watch out ! The ruler doesn't carry a sword for no reason at all . He serves God . And God is carrying out his anger through him . The ruler punishes anyone who does wrong .
45013005	You must obey the authorities . Then you will not be punished . You must also obey them because you know it is right .
45013006	That's also why you pay taxes . The authorities serve God . Ruling takes up all their time .
45013007	Give to everyone what you owe . Do you owe taxes ? Then pay them . Do you owe anything else to the government ? Then pay it . Do you owe respect ? Then give it . Do you owe honor ? Then show it .
45013008	Pay everything you owe . But you can never pay back all the love you owe each other . Those who love others have done everything the law requires .
45013009	Here are some commandments to think about . " Do not commit adultery . " " Do not commit murder . " " Do not steal . " " Do not want what belongs to others . " These and other commandments are all included in one rule . Here's what it is . " Love your neighbor as you love yourself . "
45013010	Love does not harm its neighbor . So love does everything the law requires .
45013011	When you do those things , keep in mind the times we are living in . The hour has come for you to wake up from your sleep . Our full salvation is closer now than it was when we first believed in Christ .
45013012	The dark night of evil is nearly over . The day of Christ's return is almost here . So let us get rid of the works of darkness . Let us put on the armor of light .
45013013	Let us act as we should , like people living in the daytime . Have nothing to do with wild parties . Don't get drunk . Don't take part in sexual sins or evil conduct . Don't fight with each other . Don't be jealous of anyone .
45013014	Instead , put on the Lord Jesus Christ as your clothing . Don't think about how to satisfy what your sinful nature wants .
45014001	Accept those whose faith is weak . Don't judge them where you have differences of opinion .
45014002	The faith of some people allows them to eat anything . But others eat only vegetables because their faith is weak .
45014003	People who eat everything must not look down on those who do not . And people who don't eat everything must not judge those who do . God has accepted them .
45014004	Who are you to judge someone else's servants ? Whether they are faithful or not is their own master's concern . They will be faithful , because the Lord has the power to make them faithful .
45014005	Some people consider one day to be more holy than another . Others think all days are the same . Each person should be absolutely sure in his own mind .
45014006	Those who think one day is special do it to honor the Lord . Those who eat meat do it to honor the Lord . They give thanks to God . Those who don't eat meat do it to honor the Lord . They also give thanks to God .
45014007	We don't live for ourselves alone . And we don't die all by ourselves .
45014008	If we live , we live to honor the Lord . If we die , we die to honor the Lord . So whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
45014009	Christ died and came back to life . He did this to become the Lord of both the dead and the living .
45014010	Now then , who are you to judge your brother or sister ? Why do you look down on them ? We will all stand in God's courtroom to be judged .
45014011	It is written , " ' You can be sure that I live , ' says the Lord . ' And you can be just as sure that every knee will bow down in front of me . Every tongue will tell the truth to God . ' "
45014012	So we will all have to explain to God the things we have done .
45014013	Let us stop judging one another . Instead , make up your mind not to put anything in your brother's way that would make him trip and fall .
45014014	I am absolutely sure that no food is " unclean " in itself . I say this as one who belongs to the Lord Jesus . But some people may consider a thing to be " unclean . " If they do , it is " unclean " for them .
45014015	Your brothers and sisters may be upset by what you eat . If they are , you are no longer acting as though you love them . So don't destroy them by what you eat . Christ died for them .
45014016	Don't let something you consider good be spoken of as if it were evil .
45014017	God's kingdom has nothing to do with eating or drinking . It is a matter of being right with God . It brings the peace and joy the Holy Spirit gives .
45014018	Those who serve Christ in this way are pleasing to God . They are pleasing to people too .
45014019	So let us do all we can to live in peace . And let us work hard to build each other up .
45014020	Don't destroy the work of God because of food . All food is " clean . " But it is wrong for you to eat anything that causes someone else to trip and fall .
45014021	Don't eat meat if it will cause your brothers and sisters to fall . Don't drink wine or do anything else that will make them fall .
45014022	No matter what you think about those things , keep it between yourself and God . Blessed are those who do not have to feel guilty for what they allow .
45014023	But those who have doubts are guilty if they eat . Their eating is not based on faith . Everything that is not based on faith is sin .
45015001	We who have strong faith should help the weak with their problems . We should not please only ourselves .
45015002	We should all please our neighbors . Let us do what is good for them . Let us build them up .
45015003	Even Christ did not please himself . It is written , " Those who make fun of you have made fun of me also . "
45015004	Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us . The Scriptures give us strength to go on . They cheer us up and give us hope .
45015005	Our God is a God who strengthens you and cheers you up . May he help you agree with each other as you follow Christ Jesus .
45015006	Then you can give glory to God with one heart and voice . He is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Christ has accepted you . So accept one another in order to bring praise to God .
45015008	I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews . He teaches us that God is true . He shows us that God will keep the promises he made to the founders of our nation .
45015009	Jesus became a servant of the Jews so that people who are not Jews could give glory to God for his mercy . It is written , " I will praise you among those who aren't Jews . I will sing praises to you . "
45015010	Again it says , " You non-Jews , be full of joy . Be joyful together with God's people . "
45015011	And again it says , " All you non-Jews , praise the Lord . All you nations , sing praises to him . "
45015012	And Isaiah says , " The Root of Jesse will grow up quickly . He will rule over the nations . Those who aren't Jews will put their hope in him . "
45015013	May the God who gives hope fill you with great joy . May you have perfect peace as you trust in him . May the power of the Holy Spirit fill you with hope .
45015014	My brothers and sisters , I am sure that you are full of goodness . What you know is complete . You are able to teach one another .
45015015	I have written to you very boldly about some things . I wanted you to think about them again . The grace of God has allowed me
45015016	to serve Christ Jesus among those who aren't Jews . My duty as a priest is to preach God's good news . Then the non-Jews will become an offering that pleases God . The Holy Spirit will make the offering holy .
45015017	Because I belong to Christ Jesus , I can take pride in my work for God .
45015018	I will not try to speak of anything except what Christ has done through me . He has been leading those who aren't Jews to obey God . He has been doing this by what I have said and done .
45015019	He has given me power to do signs and miracles . He has given me the power of the Holy Spirit . From Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum I have finished preaching the good news about Christ .
45015020	I have always wanted to preach the good news where Christ was not known . I don't want to build on what someone else has started .
45015021	It is written , " Those who were not told about him will understand . Those who have not heard will know what it all means . "
45015022	That's why I have often been kept from coming to you .
45015023	Now there is no more place for me to work in those areas . For many years I have been longing to see you .
45015024	So I plan to see you when I go to Spain . I hope to visit you while I am passing through . And I hope you will help me on my journey there . But first I want to enjoy being with you for a while .
45015025	Now I am on my way to Jerusalem to serve God's people there .
45015026	The believers in Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to take an offering for those who were poor among God's people in Jerusalem .
45015027	They were happy to do it . And of course they owe it to them . Those who aren't Jews have shared from the Jews' spiritual blessings . So the non-Jews should share their earthly blessings with the Jews .
45015028	I want to finish my task . I want to make sure that the poor in Jerusalem have received the offering . Then I will go to Spain . On my way I will visit you .
45015029	I know that when I come to you , I will come with the full blessing of Christ .
45015030	Brothers and sisters , I am asking you through the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me . Pray for me with the love the Holy Spirit provides .
45015031	Pray that I will be saved from those in Judea who do not believe . Pray that my work in Jerusalem will be accepted by God's people there .
45015032	Then , as God has planned , I will come to you with joy . Together we will be renewed .
45015033	May the God who gives peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	I would like you to welcome our sister Phoebe . She serves the church in Cenchrea .
45016002	I ask you to receive her as one who belongs to the Lord . Receive her in the way God's people should . Give her any help she may need from you . She has been a great help to many people , including me .
45016003	Greet Priscilla and Aquila . They work together with me in serving Christ Jesus .
45016004	They have put their lives in danger for me . I am thankful for them . So are all the non-Jewish churches .
45016005	Greet also the church that meets in the house of Priscilla and Aquila . Greet my dear friend Epenetus . He was the first person in Asia Minor to become a believer in Christ .
45016006	Greet Mary . She worked very hard for you .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junias , my relatives . They have been in prison with me . They are leaders among the apostles . They became believers in Christ before I did .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus . I love him as a brother in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus . He works together with me in serving Christ . And greet my dear friend Stachys .
45016010	Greet Apelles . Even though he was put to the test , he remained faithful as one who belonged to Christ . Greet those who live in the house of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet Herodion , my relative . Greet the believers who live in the house of Narcissus .
45016012	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa . Those women work hard for the Lord . Greet my dear friend Persis . She is another woman who has worked very hard for the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus . He is a choice believer in the Lord . And greet his mother . She has been like a mother to me too .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon and Hermes . Greet Patrobas , Hermas and the believers with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister . Greet Olympas and all of God's people with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ send their greetings .
45016017	I am warning you , brothers and sisters , to watch out for those who try to keep you from staying together . They want to trip you up . They teach you things opposite to what you have learned . Stay away from them .
45016018	People like that are not serving Christ our Lord . They are serving only themselves . With smooth talk and with words they don't mean they fool people who don't know any better .
45016019	Everyone has heard that you obey God . So you have filled me with joy . I want you to be wise about what is good . And I want you to have nothing to do with what is evil .
45016020	The God who gives peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . May the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .
45016021	Timothy works together with me . He sends his greetings to you . So do Lucius , Jason and Sosipater , my relatives .
45016022	I , Tertius , wrote down this letter . I greet you as a believer in the Lord .
45016025	May God receive glory . He is able to strengthen your faith because of the good news I preach . It is the message about Jesus Christ . It is in keeping with the mystery that was hidden for a very long time .
45016026	The mystery has now been made known through the writings of the prophets . The eternal God commanded that it be made known . He wanted all nations to believe and obey him .
45016027	May the only wise God receive glory forever through Jesus Christ . Amen .
46001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I have been chosen to be an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . Our brother Sosthenes joins me in writing .
46001002	We are sending this letter to you , the members of God's church in Corinth . You have been made holy because you belong to Christ Jesus . God has chosen you to be his holy people . He has done the same for all those everywhere who pray to our Lord Jesus Christ . Jesus is their Lord and ours .
46001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
46001004	I always thank God for you . I thank him because of the grace he has given to you who belong to Christ Jesus .
46001005	You have been blessed in every way because of him . All your teaching of the truth is better . Your understanding of it is more complete .
46001006	Our witness about Christ has been proved to be true in you .
46001007	There is no gift of the Holy Spirit that you don't have . You are full of hope as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again .
46001008	God will keep you strong to the very end . Then you will be without blame on the day our Lord Jesus Christ returns .
46001009	God is faithful . He has chosen you to share life with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	Brothers and sisters , I ask all of you to agree with one another . I make my appeal in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . Then you won't take sides . You will be in complete agreement in all that you think .
46001011	My brothers and sisters , some people who live in Chloe's house have told me you are arguing with each other .
46001012	Here is what I mean . One of you says , " I follow Paul . " Another says , " I follow Apollos . " Another says , " I follow Peter . " And still another says , " I follow Christ . "
46001013	Does Christ take sides ? Did Paul die on the cross for you ? Were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I'm thankful that I didn't baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius .
46001015	No one can say that you were baptized in my name .
46001016	It's true that I also baptized those who live in the house of Stephanas . Besides that , I don't remember if I baptized anyone else .
46001017	Christ did not send me to baptize . He sent me to preach the good news . He commanded me not to use the kind of wisdom that people commonly use . That would take all the power away from the cross of Christ .
46001018	The message of the cross seems foolish to those who are lost and dying . But it is God's power to us who are being saved .
46001019	It is written , " I will destroy the wisdom of those who are wise . I will do away with the cleverness of those who think they are so smart . "
46001020	Where is the wise person ? Where is the educated person ? Where are the great thinkers of this world ? Hasn't God made the wisdom of the world foolish ?
46001021	God wisely planned that the world would not know him through its own wisdom . It pleased God to use the foolish things we preach to save those who believe .
46001022	Jews require miraculous signs . Greeks look for wisdom .
46001023	But we preach about Christ and his death on the cross . That is very hard for Jews to accept . And everyone else thinks it's foolish .
46001024	But there are those God has chosen , both Jews and others . To them Christ is God's power and God's wisdom .
46001025	The foolish things of God are wiser than human wisdom . The weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
46001026	Brothers and sisters , think of what you were when God chose you . Not many of you were considered wise by human standards . Not many of you were powerful . Not many of you belonged to important families .
46001027	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise . He chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
46001028	God chose the things of this world that are common and looked down on . He chose what is not considered to be important to do away with what is considered to be important .
46001029	So no one can brag to God .
46001030	Because of what God has done , you belong to Christ Jesus . He has become God's wisdom for us . He makes us right with God . He makes us holy and sets us free .
46001031	It is written , " The one who brags should brag about what the Lord has done . "
46002001	Brothers and sisters , when I came to you I didn't come with fancy words or great wisdom . I preached to you the truth about God's love .
46002002	I made up my mind to pay attention to only one thing while I was with you . That one thing was Jesus Christ and his death on the cross .
46002003	When I came to you , I was weak and afraid and trembling all over .
46002004	I didn't preach my message with clever and compelling words . As I preached , the Holy Spirit showed his power .
46002005	That was so you would believe not because of human wisdom but because of God's power .
46002006	The words we speak to those who have grown in the faith are wise . Our words are different from the words of the wise people or rulers of this world . People like that aren't going anywhere .
46002007	No , we speak about God's secret wisdom . His wisdom has been hidden . But before time began , God planned that his wisdom would bring us heavenly glory .
46002008	None of the rulers of this world understood God's wisdom . If they had , they would not have nailed the Lord of glory to the cross .
46002009	It is written , " No eye has seen , no ear has heard , no mind has known what God has prepared for those who love him . "
46002010	But God has shown it to us through his Spirit . The Spirit understands all things . He understands even the deep things of God .
46002011	Who can know the thoughts of another person ? Only a person's own spirit can know them . In the same way , only the Spirit of God knows God's thoughts .
46002012	We have not received the spirit of the world . We have received the Spirit who is from God . The Spirit helps us understand what God has freely given us .
46002013	That is what we speak about . We don't use words taught to us by people . We use words taught to us by the Holy Spirit . We use the words of the Spirit to teach the truths of the Spirit .
46002014	Some people don't have the Holy Spirit . They don't accept the things that come from the Spirit of God . Things like that are foolish to them . They can't understand them . In fact , such things can't be understood without the Spirit's help .
46002015	Everyone who has the Spirit can judge all things . But no one can judge those who have the Spirit . It is written ,
46002016	" Who can ever know what is in the Lord's mind ? Can anyone ever teach him ? " But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	Brothers and sisters , I couldn't speak to you as if you were guided by the Holy Spirit . I had to speak to you as if you were following the ways of the world . You aren't growing as Christ wants you to . You are still like babies .
46003002	The words I spoke to you were like milk , not like solid food . You weren't ready for solid food yet . And you still aren't ready for it .
46003003	You are still following the ways of the world . Some of you are jealous . Some of you argue . So aren't you following the ways of the world ? Aren't you acting like ordinary human beings ?
46003004	One of you says , " I follow Paul . " Another says , " I follow Apollos . " Aren't you acting like ordinary human beings ?
46003005	After all , what is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? We are only people who serve . We helped you to believe . The Lord has given each of us our own work to do .
46003006	I planted the seed . Apollos watered it . But God made it grow .
46003007	So the one who plants is not important . The one who waters is not important . It is God who makes things grow . He is the One who is important .
46003008	The one who plants and the one who waters have the same purpose . The Lord will give each of us a reward for our work .
46003009	We work together with God . You are like God's field . You are like his building .
46003010	God has given me the grace to lay a foundation as a master builder . Now someone else is building on it . But each one should build carefully .
46003011	No one can lay any other foundation than the one that has already been laid . That foundation is Jesus Christ .
46003012	A person may build on it using gold , silver , jewels , wood , hay or straw .
46003013	But each person's work will be shown for what it is . On judgment day it will be brought to light . It will be put through fire . The fire will test how good everyone's work is .
46003014	If the building doesn't burn up , God will give the builder a reward for his work .
46003015	If the building burns up , the builder will lose everything . The builder will be saved , but only like one escaping through the flames .
46003016	Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple ? God's Spirit lives in you .
46003017	If anyone destroys God's temple , God will destroy him . God's temple is holy . And you are that temple .
46003018	Don't fool yourselves . Suppose some of you think you are wise by the standards of the world . Then you should become a " fool " so that you can become wise .
46003019	The wisdom of this world is foolish in God's eyes . It is written , " God catches wise people in their own tricks . "
46003020	It is also written , " The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise don't amount to anything . "
46003021	So no more bragging about human beings ! All things are yours .
46003022	That means Paul or Apollos or Peter or the world or life or death or the present or the future . All are yours .
46003023	You are joined to Christ and belong to him . And Christ is joined to God .
46004001	Here is how you should think of us . We serve Christ . We are trusted with God's secret truth .
46004002	Those who have been given a trust must prove that they are faithful .
46004003	I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court . I don't even judge myself .
46004004	I don't feel I have done anything wrong . But that doesn't mean I'm not guilty . The Lord judges me .
46004005	So don't judge anything before the appointed time . Wait until the Lord returns . He will bring to light what is hidden in the dark . He will show the real reasons why people do what they do . At that time each person will receive praise from God .
46004006	Brothers and sisters , I have used myself and Apollos as examples to help you . You can learn from us the meaning of the saying , " Don't go beyond what is written . " Then you won't be proud that you follow one person instead of another .
46004007	Who makes you different from anyone else ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you brag as though you did not ?
46004008	You already have everything you want , don't you ? Have you already become rich ? Have you begun to rule as kings ? And did you do that without us ? I wish that you really had begun to rule . Then we could rule with you !
46004009	It seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of a parade . We are like men sentenced to die in front of a crowd . We have been made a show for the whole creation to see . Angels and people are staring at us .
46004010	We are fools for Christ . But you are so wise in Christ ! We are weak . But you are so strong ! You are honored . But we are looked down on !
46004011	Up to this very hour we are hungry and thirsty . We are dressed in rags . We are being treated badly . We have no homes .
46004012	We work hard with our own hands . When others call down a curse on us , we bless them . When we are attacked , we put up with it .
46004013	When others say bad things about us , we answer kindly . Up to this moment we have become the world's garbage . We are everybody's trash .
46004014	I am not writing this to shame you . You are my dear children , and I want to warn you .
46004015	You may have 10,000 believers in Christ watching over you . But you don't have many fathers . I became your father by serving Christ Jesus and telling you the good news .
46004016	So I'm asking you to follow my example .
46004017	That's the reason I'm sending Timothy to you . He is like a son to me , and I love him . He is faithful in serving the Lord . He will remind you of my way of life in serving Christ Jesus . And that agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church .
46004018	Some of you have become proud . You act as if I weren't coming to you .
46004019	But I will come very soon , if that's what the Lord wants . Then I will find out how those proud people are talking . I will also find out what power they have .
46004020	The kingdom of God is not a matter of talk . It is a matter of power .
46004021	Which do you want ? Should I come to you with a whip ? Or should I come in love and with a gentle spirit ?
46005001	It is actually reported that there is sexual sin among you . I'm told that a man is living with his father's wife and is having sex with her . Even people who do not know God don't commit that sin .
46005002	And you are proud ! Shouldn't you be filled with sadness instead ? Shouldn't you have put the man who did that out of your church ?
46005003	Even though I am not right there with you , I am with you in spirit . And I have already judged the one who did that , just as if I were there .
46005004	When you come together in the name of our Lord Jesus , I will be with you in spirit . The power of our Lord Jesus will also be with you .
46005005	When you come together like that , hand that man over to Satan . Then his sinful nature will be destroyed . His spirit will be saved on the day the Lord returns .
46005006	Your bragging is not good . It is like yeast . Don't you know that just a little yeast works its way through the whole batch of dough ?
46005007	Get rid of the old yeast . Be like a new batch of dough without yeast . That is what you really are , because Christ has been offered up for us . He is our Passover lamb .
46005008	So let us keep the Feast , but not with the old yeast . I'm talking about yeast that is full of hatred and evil . Let us keep the Feast with bread made without yeast . Let us do it with bread that is honest and true .
46005009	I wrote a letter to you to tell you to stay away from people who commit sexual sins .
46005010	I didn't mean the people of this world who sin that way or who always want more and more . I didn't mean those who cheat or who worship statues of gods . In that case you would have to leave this world !
46005011	But here is what I am writing to you . You must stay away from anyone who claims to be a believer but who does those things . Stay away from anyone who commits sexual sins or who always wants more and more things . Stay away from a person who worships statues of gods or who tells lies about others . Stay away from anyone who gets drunk or who cheats . Don't even eat with a person like that .
46005012	Is it my business to judge those outside the church ? Aren't you supposed to judge those inside the church ?
46005013	God will judge those outside . Scripture says , " Get rid of that evil person ! "
46006001	Suppose one of you wants to bring a charge against another believer . Should you take it to the ungodly to be judged ? Why not take it to God's people ?
46006002	Don't you know that God's people will judge the world ? And if you are going to judge the world , aren't you able to judge small cases ?
46006003	Don't you know that we will judge angels ? Then we should be able to judge the things of this life even more !
46006004	So if you want to press charges in matters like that , appoint as judges members of the church who aren't very important !
46006005	I say this to shame you . Is it possible that no one among you is wise enough to judge matters between believers ?
46006006	Instead , one believer goes to court against another . And this happens in front of unbelievers !
46006007	The very fact that you take another believer to court means you have lost the battle already . Why not be treated wrongly ? Why not be cheated ?
46006008	Instead , you yourselves cheat and do wrong . And you do it to your brothers and sisters .
46006009	Don't you know that evil people will not receive God's kingdom ? Don't be fooled . Those who commit sexual sins will not receive the kingdom . Neither will those who worship statues of gods or commit adultery . Neither will men who are prostitutes or who commit homosexual acts .
46006010	Neither will thieves or those who always want more and more . Neither will those who are often drunk or tell lies or cheat . People who live like that will not receive God's kingdom .
46006011	Some of you used to do those things . But your sins were washed away . You were made holy . You were made right with God . All of that was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God .
46006012	Some of you say , " Everything is permitted for me . " But not everything is good for me . Again some of you say , " Everything is permitted for me . " But I will not be controlled by anything .
46006013	Some of you say , " Food is for the stomach . And the stomach is for food . " But God will destroy both of them . The body is not meant for sexual sins . The body is meant for the Lord . And the Lord is meant for the body .
46006014	By his power God raised the Lord from the dead . He will also raise us up .
46006015	Don't you know that your bodies belong to the body of Christ ? Should I take what belongs to Christ and join it to a prostitute ? Never !
46006016	Don't you know that when you join yourself to a prostitute , you become one with her in body ? Scripture says , " The two will become one . "
46006017	But anyone who is joined to the Lord becomes one with him in spirit .
46006018	Keep far away from sexual sins . All the other sins a person commits are outside his body . But sexual sins are sins against one's own body .
46006019	Don't you know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit ? The Spirit is in you . You have received him from God . You do not belong to yourselves .
46006020	Christ has paid the price for you . So use your bodies in a way that honors God .
46007001	Now I want to deal with the things you wrote me about . Some of you say , " It is good for a man not to have sex with a woman . "
46007002	But since there is so much sexual sin , each man should have his own wife . And each woman should have her own husband .
46007003	A husband should satisfy his wife's sexual needs . And a wife should satisfy her husband's sexual needs .
46007004	The wife's body does not belong only to her . It also belongs to her husband . In the same way , the husband's body does not belong only to him . It also belongs to his wife .
46007005	You shouldn't stop giving yourselves to each other except when you both agree to do so . And that should be only to give yourselves time to pray for a while . Then you should come together again . In that way , Satan will not tempt you when you can't control yourselves .
46007006	I say those things to you as my advice , not as a command .
46007007	I wish all of you were like me . But you each have your own gift from God . One has this gift . Another has that .
46007008	I speak to those who are not married . I also speak to widows . It is good for you to stay single like me .
46007009	But if you can't control yourselves , you should get married . It is better to get married than to burn with sexual longing .
46007010	I give a command to those who are married . It is a direct command from the Lord , not from me . A wife must not leave her husband .
46007011	But if she does , she must not get married again . Or she can go back to her husband . And a husband must not divorce his wife .
46007012	I also have something to say to everyone else . It is from me , not a direct command from the Lord . Suppose a brother has a wife who is not a believer . If she is willing to live with him , he must not divorce her .
46007013	And suppose a woman has a husband who is not a believer . If he is willing to live with her , she must not divorce him .
46007014	The unbelieving husband has been made holy through his wife . The unbelieving wife has been made holy through her believing husband . If that were not the case , your children would not be pure and clean . But as it is , they are holy .
46007015	If the unbeliever leaves , let that person go . In that case , a believing man or woman does not have to stay married . God wants us to live in peace .
46007016	Wife , how do you know if you can save your husband ? Husband , how do you know if you can save your wife ?
46007017	But each of you should remain in the place in life that the Lord has given you . Stay as you were when God chose you . That's the rule all the churches must follow .
46007018	Was a man already circumcised when God chose him ? Then he should not become uncircumcised . Was he uncircumcised when God chose him ? Then he should not be circumcised .
46007019	Being circumcised means nothing . Being uncircumcised means nothing . Doing what God commands is what counts .
46007020	Each of you should stay as you were when God chose you .
46007021	Were you a slave when God chose you ? Don't let it trouble you . But if you can get your master to set you free , do it .
46007022	Those who were slaves when the Lord chose them are now the Lord's free people . Those who were free when God chose them are now slaves of Christ .
46007023	Christ has paid the price for you . Don't become slaves of human beings .
46007024	Brothers and sisters , you are accountable to God . So all of you should stay as you were when God chose you .
46007025	Now I want to say something about virgins . I have no direct command from the Lord . But I give my opinion . Because of the Lord's mercy , I give it as one who can be trusted .
46007026	Times are hard for you right now . So I think it's good for you to stay as you are .
46007027	Are you married ? Then don't get a divorce . Are you single ? Then don't look for a wife .
46007028	But if you get married , you have not sinned . And if a virgin gets married , she has not sinned . But those who get married will have many troubles in this life . I want to save you from that .
46007029	Brothers and sisters , what I mean is that the time is short . From now on , those who have a husband or wife should live as if they did not .
46007030	Those who are sad should live as if they were not . Those who are happy should live as if they were not . Those who buy something should live as if it were not theirs to keep .
46007031	Those who use the things of the world should not become all wrapped up in them . The world as it now exists is passing away .
46007032	I don't want you to have anything to worry about . A single man is concerned about the Lord's matters . He wants to know how he can please the Lord .
46007033	But a married man is concerned about the matters of this world . He wants to know how he can please his wife .
46007034	His concerns pull him in two directions . A single woman or a virgin is concerned about the Lord's matters . She wants to serve the Lord with both body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the matters of this world . She wants to know how she can please her husband .
46007035	I'm saying those things for your own good . I'm not trying to hold you back . I want you to be free to live in a way that is right . I want you to give yourselves completely to the Lord .
46007036	Suppose a man thinks he is not acting properly toward the virgin he has promised to marry . Suppose she is getting old , and he feels that he should marry her . He should do as he wants . He is not sinning . They should get married .
46007037	But suppose the man has decided not to marry the virgin . And suppose he has no compelling need to get married and can control himself . If he has made up his mind not to get married , he also does the right thing .
46007038	So then , the man who marries the virgin does the right thing . But the man who doesn't marry her does an even better thing .
46007039	A woman has to stay married to her husband as long as he lives . If he dies , she is free to marry anyone she wants to . But the one she marries must belong to the Lord .
46007040	In my opinion , she is happier if she stays single . And I also think that I am led by the Spirit of God in saying that .
46008001	Now I want to deal with food offered to statues of gods . We know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge makes people proud . But love builds them up .
46008002	Those who think they know something still don't know as they should .
46008003	But those who love God are known by God .
46008004	So then , here is what I say about eating food that is offered to statues of gods . We know that a god made by human hands is really nothing at all in the world . We know there is only one God .
46008005	There may be so-called gods either in heaven or on earth . In fact , there are many " gods " and many " lords . "
46008006	But for us there is only one God . He is the Father . All things came from him , and we live for him . And there is only one Lord . He is Jesus Christ . All things came because of him , and we live because of him .
46008007	But not everyone knows that . Some people still think that statues of gods are real gods . When they eat food that was offered to statues of gods , they think of it as food that was offered to real gods . And because they have a weak sense of what is right and wrong , they feel guilty .
46008008	But food doesn't bring us close to God . We are no worse if we don't eat . We are no better if we do eat .
46008009	But be careful how you use your freedom . Be sure it doesn't trip up someone who is weaker than you .
46008010	Suppose you who have that knowledge are eating in a temple of one of those gods . And suppose someone who has a weak sense of what is right and wrong sees you . Won't that person become bold and eat what has been offered to statues of gods ?
46008011	If so , then your knowledge destroys that weak brother or sister for whom Christ died .
46008012	When you sin against other believers in that way , you harm their weak sense of what is right and wrong . By doing that you sin against Christ .
46008013	So what should I do if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin ? I will never eat meat again . In that way , I will not cause them to fall .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord ? Aren't you the result of my work for the Lord ?
46009002	Even though others may not think of me as an apostle , I am certainly one to you ! You are the proof that I am the Lord's apostle .
46009003	That is what I say to stand up for myself when people judge me .
46009004	Don't we have the right to eat and drink ?
46009005	Don't we have the right to take a believing wife with us when we travel ? The other apostles do . The Lord's brothers do . Peter does .
46009006	Or are Barnabas and I the only ones who have to work for a living ?
46009007	Who serves as a soldier but doesn't get paid ? Who plants a vineyard but doesn't eat any of its grapes ? Who takes care of a flock but doesn't drink any of the milk ?
46009008	Do I say that from only a human point of view ? The Law says the same thing .
46009009	Here is what is written in the Law of Moses . " Do not stop an ox from eating while it helps separate the grain from the straw . " Is it oxen that God is concerned about ?
46009010	Doesn't he say that for us ? Yes , it was written for us . When a farmer plows and separates the grain , he does it because he hopes to share in the crop .
46009011	We have planted spiritual seed among you . Is it too much to ask that we receive from you some of the things we need ?
46009012	Others have the right to receive help from you . Don't we have even more right to do so ? But we didn't use that right . No , we have put up with everything . We didn't want to keep the good news of Christ from spreading .
46009013	Don't you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple ? Don't you know that those who serve at the altar eat from what is offered on the altar ?
46009014	In the same way , those who preach the good news should receive their living from their work . That is what the Lord has commanded .
46009015	But I haven't used any of those rights . And I'm not writing because I hope you will do things like that for me . I would rather die than have anyone take away my pride in my work .
46009016	But when I preach the good news , I can't brag . I have to preach it . How terrible it will be for me if I do not preach the good news !
46009017	If I preach because I want to , I get a reward . If I preach because I have to , I'm only doing my duty .
46009018	Then what reward do I get ? Here is what it is . I am able to preach the good news free of charge . And I can do it without making use of my rights when I preach it .
46009019	I am free . I don't belong to anyone . But I make myself a slave to everyone . I do it to win as many as I can to Christ .
46009020	To the Jews I became like a Jew . That was to win the Jews . To those under the law I became like one who was under the law , even though I myself am not under the law . That was to win those under the law .
46009021	To those who don't have the law I became like one who doesn't have the law . I am not free from God's law . I am under Christ's law . Now I can win those who don't have the law .
46009022	To those who are weak I became weak . That was to win the weak . I have become all things to all people so that in all possible ways I might save some .
46009023	I do all of that because of the good news . And I want to share in its blessings .
46009024	In a race all the runners run . But only one gets the prize . You know that , don't you ? So run in a way that will get you the prize .
46009025	All who take part in the games train hard . They do it to get a crown that will not last . But we do it to get a crown that will last forever .
46009026	So I do not run like someone who doesn't run toward the finish line . I do not fight like a boxer who hits nothing but air .
46009027	No , I train my body and bring it under control . Then after I have preached to others , I myself will not break the rules and fail to win the prize .
46010001	Brothers and sisters , here is what I want you to know about our people who lived long ago . They were all led by the cloud . They all walked through the Red Sea .
46010002	They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	They all ate the same supernatural food .
46010004	They all drank the same supernatural water . They drank from the supernatural rock that went with them . That rock was Christ .
46010005	But God was not pleased with most of them . Their bodies were scattered all over the desert .
46010006	Now those things happened as examples for us . They are supposed to keep us from longing for evil things , as the people of Israel did .
46010007	So don't worship statues of gods , as some of them did . It is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink . Then they got up to dance wildly in front of their god . "
46010008	We should not commit sexual sins , as some of them did . In one day 23,000 of them died .
46010009	We should not put the Lord to the test , as some of them did . They were killed by snakes .
46010010	Don't tell your leaders how unhappy you are with them . That's what some of the people of Israel did . And they were killed by the destroying angel .
46010011	Those things happened to them as examples for us . They were written down to warn us who are living at the time when God's work is being completed .
46010012	So be careful . When you think you are standing firm , you might fall .
46010013	You are tempted in the same way all other human beings are . God is faithful . He will not let you be tempted any more than you can take . But when you are tempted , God will give you a way out so that you can stand up under it .
46010014	My dear friends , run away from statues of gods . Don't worship them .
46010015	I'm talking to people who are reasonable . Judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	When we give thanks for the cup at the Lord's Supper , aren't we sharing in the blood of Christ ? When we break the bread , aren't we sharing in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Just as there is one loaf , so we who are many are one body . We all eat from the one loaf .
46010018	Think about the people of Israel . Don't those who eat the offerings share in the altar ?
46010019	Do I mean that what is offered to a statue of a god is anything ? Do I mean that a statue of a god is anything ?
46010020	No ! But what is offered by those who worship statues of gods is really offered to demons . It is not offered to God . I don't want you to be sharing with demons .
46010021	You can't drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too . You can't have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons .
46010022	Are we trying to make the Lord jealous ? Are we stronger than he is ?
46010023	You say , " Everything is permitted . " But not everything is good for us . Again you say , " Everything is permitted . " But not everything builds us up .
46010024	We should not look out for our own interests . Instead , we should look out for the interests of others .
46010025	Eat anything that is sold in the meat market . Don't ask if it's right or wrong .
46010026	Scripture says , " The earth belongs to the Lord . And so does everything in it . "
46010027	Suppose an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go . Then eat anything that is put in front of you . Don't ask if it's right or wrong .
46010028	But suppose someone says to you , " This food has been offered to a statue of a god . " Then don't eat it . Keep in mind the good of the one who told you . And don't eat because of a sense of what is right and wrong .
46010029	I'm talking about the other person's sense of what is right and wrong , not yours . Why should my freedom be judged by what someone else thinks ?
46010030	Suppose I give thanks when I eat . Then why should I be blamed for eating food I thank God for ?
46010031	So eat and drink and do everything else for the glory of God .
46010032	Don't do anything that causes another person to trip and fall . It doesn't matter if that person is a Jew or a Greek or a member of God's church .
46010033	Follow my example . I try to please everyone in every way . I'm not looking out for what is good for me . I'm looking out for the interests of others . I do it so that they might be saved .
46011001	Follow my example , just as I follow the example of Christ .
46011002	I praise you for being faithful in remembering me . I also praise you for staying true to all my teachings , just as I gave them to you .
46011003	Now I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ . The head of the woman is the man . And the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame on his head .
46011005	And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered brings shame on her head . It is just as if her head were shaved .
46011006	What if a woman does not cover her head ? She should have her hair cut off . But it is shameful for her to cut her hair or shave it off . So she should cover her head .
46011007	A man should not cover his head . He is the likeness and glory of God . But the woman is the glory of the man .
46011008	The man did not come from the woman . The woman came from the man .
46011009	Also , the man was not created for the woman . The woman was created for the man .
46011010	That's why a woman should have her head covered . It shows that she is under authority . She should also cover her head because of the angels .
46011011	But here is how things are for those who belong to the Lord . The woman is not independent of the man . And the man is not independent of the woman .
46011012	The woman came from the man , and the man is born from the woman . But everything comes from God .
46011013	You be the judge . Is it proper for a woman to pray to God without covering her head ?
46011014	Suppose a man has long hair . Doesn't the very nature of things teach you that it is shameful ?
46011015	And suppose a woman has long hair . Doesn't the very nature of things teach you that it is her glory ? Long hair is given to her as a covering .
46011016	If anyone wants to argue about that , we don't have any other practice . And God's churches don't either .
46011017	In the following matters , I don't praise you . Your meetings do more harm than good .
46011018	First , here is what people are telling me . When you come together as a church , you take sides . And in some ways I believe it .
46011019	No doubt you need to take sides in order to show which of you God agrees with !
46011020	When you come together , it is not the Lord's Supper you eat .
46011021	As you eat , each of you goes ahead without waiting for anyone else . One remains hungry and another gets drunk .
46011022	Don't you have homes to eat and drink in ? Or do you think so little of God's church that you shame those in it who have nothing ? What should I say to you ? Should I praise you for that ? Certainly not !
46011023	I passed on to you what I received from the Lord . On the night the Lord Jesus was handed over to his enemies , he took bread .
46011024	When he had given thanks , he broke it . He said , " This is my body . It is given for you . Every time you eat it , do it in memory of me . "
46011025	In the same way , after supper he took the cup . He said , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Every time you drink it , do it in memory of me . "
46011026	When you eat the bread and drink the cup , you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again .
46011027	So do not eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in a way that isn't worthy of him . If you do , you will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	A person should take a careful look at himself before he eats the bread and drinks from the cup .
46011029	Anyone who eats and drinks must recognize the body of the Lord . If he doesn't , God will judge him for it .
46011030	That is why many of you are weak and sick . That is why a number of you have died .
46011031	We should judge ourselves . Then we would not be found guilty .
46011032	When the Lord judges us , he corrects us . Then we will not be judged along with the rest of the world .
46011033	My brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat , wait for each other .
46011034	Those who are hungry should eat at home . Then when you come together , you will not be judged . When I come , I will give you more directions .
46012001	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know about the gifts of the Holy Spirit .
46012002	You know that at one time you were unbelievers . You were somehow drawn away to worship statues of gods that couldn't even speak .
46012003	So I tell you that no one who is speaking with the help of God's Spirit says , " May Jesus be cursed . " And without the help of the Holy Spirit no one can say , " Jesus is Lord . "
46012004	There are different kinds of gifts . But they are all given by the same Spirit .
46012005	There are different ways to serve . But they all come from the same Lord .
46012006	There are different ways to work . But the same God makes it possible for all of us to have all those different things .
46012007	The Holy Spirit is given to each of us in a special way . That is for the good of all .
46012008	To some people the Spirit gives the message of wisdom . To others the same Spirit gives the message of knowledge .
46012009	To others the same Spirit gives faith . To others that one Spirit gives gifts of healing .
46012010	To others he gives the power to do miracles . To others he gives the ability to prophesy . To others he gives the ability to tell the spirits apart . To others he gives the ability to speak in different kinds of languages they had not known before . And to still others he gives the ability to explain what was said in those languages .
46012011	All of the gifts are produced by one and the same Spirit . He gives them to each person , just as he decides .
46012012	There is one body . But it has many parts . Even though it has many parts , they make up one body . It is the same with Christ .
46012013	We were all baptized by one Holy Spirit into one body . It didn't matter whether we were Jews or Greeks , slaves or free people . We were all given the same Spirit to drink .
46012014	The body is not made up of just one part . It has many parts .
46012015	Suppose the foot says , " I am not a hand . So I don't belong to the body . " It is still part of the body .
46012016	And suppose the ear says , " I am not an eye . So I don't belong to the body . " It is still part of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , how could it hear ? If the whole body were an ear , how could it smell ?
46012018	God has placed each part in the body just as he wanted it to be .
46012019	If all the parts were the same , how could there be a body ?
46012020	As it is , there are many parts . But there is only one body .
46012021	The eye can't say to the hand , " I don't need you ! " The head can't say to the feet , " I don't need you ! "
46012022	In fact , it is just the opposite . The parts of the body that seem to be weaker are the ones we can't do without .
46012023	The parts that we think are less important we treat with special honor . The private parts aren't shown . But they are treated with special care .
46012024	The parts that can be shown don't need special care . But God has joined together all the parts of the body . And he has given more honor to the parts that didn't have any .
46012025	In that way , the parts of the body will not take sides . All of them will take care of each other .
46012026	If one part suffers , every part suffers with it . If one part is honored , every part shares in its joy .
46012027	You are the body of Christ . Each one of you is a part of it .
46012028	First , God has appointed apostles in the church . Second , he has appointed prophets . Third , he has appointed teachers . Then he has appointed people who do miracles and those who have gifts of healing . He also appointed those able to help others , those able to direct things , and those who can speak in different kinds of languages they had not known before .
46012029	Is everyone an apostle ? Is everyone a prophet ? Is everyone a teacher ? Do all work miracles ?
46012030	Do all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak in languages they had not known before ? Do all explain what is said in those languages ?
46012031	But above all , you should want the more important gifts . And now I will show you the best way of all .
46013001	Suppose I speak in the languages of human beings and of angels . If I don't have love , I am only a loud gong or a noisy cymbal .
46013002	Suppose I have the gift of prophecy . Suppose I can understand all the secret things of God and know everything about him . And suppose I have enough faith to move mountains . If I don't have love , I am nothing at all .
46013003	Suppose I give everything I have to poor people . And suppose I give my body to be burned . If I don't have love , I get nothing at all .
46013004	Love is patient . Love is kind . It does not want what belongs to others . It does not brag . It is not proud .
46013005	It is not rude . It does not look out for its own interests . It does not easily become angry . It does not keep track of other people's wrongs .
46013006	Love is not happy with evil . But it is full of joy when the truth is spoken .
46013007	It always protects . It always trusts . It always hopes . It never gives up .
46013008	Love never fails . But prophecy will pass away . Speaking in languages that had not been known before will end . And knowledge will pass away .
46013009	What we know now is not complete . What we prophesy now is not perfect .
46013010	But when what is perfect comes , the things that are not perfect will pass away .
46013011	When I was a child , I talked like a child . I thought like a child . I had the understanding of a child . When I became a man , I put childish ways behind me .
46013012	Now we see only a dim likeness of things . It is as if we were seeing them in a mirror . But someday we will see clearly . We will see face to face . What I know now is not complete . But someday I will know completely , just as God knows me completely .
46013013	The three most important things to have are faith , hope and love . But the greatest of them is love .
46014001	Follow the way of love . You should also want the gifts the Holy Spirit gives . Most of all , you should want the gift of prophecy .
46014002	Anyone who speaks in a language he had not known before doesn't speak to people . He speaks only to God . In fact , no one understands that person . What he says with his spirit remains a mystery .
46014003	But anyone who prophesies speaks to people . He says things to make them stronger , to give them hope and to comfort them .
46014004	Those who speak in other languages build themselves up . But those who prophesy build up the church .
46014005	I would like all of you to speak in other languages . But I would rather have you prophesy . Those who prophesy are more helpful than those who speak in other languages . But that is not the case if those who speak in other languages explain what they have said . Then the whole church can be built up .
46014006	Brothers and sisters , suppose I were to come to you and speak in other languages . What good would I be to you ? None ! I would need to come with new truth or knowledge , or a prophecy or a teaching .
46014007	Here are some examples . Certain objects make sounds . Take a flute or a harp . No one will know what the tune is unless different notes are played .
46014008	Also , if the trumpet call isn't clear , who will get ready for battle ?
46014009	It's the same with you . You must speak words that people understand . If you don't , no one will know what you are saying . You will just be speaking into the air .
46014010	It is true that there are all kinds of languages in the world . And they all have meaning .
46014011	But if I don't understand what someone is saying , I am a stranger to that person . And that person is a stranger to me .
46014012	It's the same with you . You want to have gifts of the Spirit . So try to do your best in using gifts that build up the church .
46014013	For that reason , those who speak in languages they had not known before should pray that they can explain what they say .
46014014	If I pray in another language , my spirit prays . But my mind does not pray .
46014015	So what should I do ? I will pray with my spirit . But I will also pray with my mind . I will sing with my spirit . But I will also sing with my mind .
46014016	Suppose you are praising God with your spirit . And suppose there are visitors among you who don't understand what's going on . How can they say " Amen " when you give thanks ? They don't know what you are saying .
46014017	You might be giving thanks well enough . But the others are not being built up .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in other languages more than all of you do .
46014019	But in the church I would rather speak five words that people can understand than 10,000 words in another language . Then I would be teaching others .
46014020	Brothers and sisters , stop thinking like children . Be like babies as far as evil is concerned . But be grown up in your thinking .
46014021	In the Law it is written , " Through people who speak unfamiliar languages and through the lips of strangers I will speak to these people . But even then they will not listen to me . " That is what the Lord says .
46014022	So speaking in other languages is a sign for those who don't believe . It is not a sign for those who do believe . But prophecy is for believers . It is not for those who don't believe .
46014023	Suppose the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in other languages . And suppose visitors or unbelievers come in . Won't they say you are out of your minds ?
46014024	But suppose unbelievers or visitors come in while everyone is prophesying . Then they will be shown by all who speak that they are sinners . They will be judged by all .
46014025	The secrets of their hearts will be brought out into the open . They will fall down and worship God . They will exclaim , " God is really here among you ! "
46014026	Brothers and sisters , what should we say then ? When you come together , every one of you brings something . You bring a hymn or a teaching or a word from God . You bring a message in another language or explain what was said . All of those things must be done to make the church strong .
46014027	No more than two or three people should speak in another language . And they should speak one at a time . Then someone must explain what was said .
46014028	If there is no one to explain , the speakers should keep quiet in the church . They can speak to themselves and to God .
46014029	Only two or three prophets are supposed to speak . Others should decide if what is being said is true .
46014030	What if a message from God comes to someone else who is sitting there ? Then the one who is speaking should stop .
46014031	Those who prophesy can all take turns . In that way , everyone can be taught and be given hope .
46014032	Those who prophesy should control their speaking .
46014033	God is not a God of disorder . He is a God of peace . As in all the churches of God's people ,
46014034	women should remain silent in the meetings . They are not allowed to speak . They must follow the lead of those who are in authority , as the Law says .
46014035	If they have a question about something , they should ask their own husbands at home . It is shameful for women to speak in church meetings .
46014036	Did the word of God begin with you ? Or are you the only people it has reached ?
46014037	Suppose some think they are prophets or have gifts of the Holy Spirit . They should agree that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command .
46014038	Anyone who does not recognize that will not be recognized .
46014039	Brothers and sisters , you should want to prophesy . And don't stop people from speaking in languages they had not known before .
46014040	But everything should be done in a proper and orderly way .
46015001	Brothers and sisters , I want to remind you of the good news I preached to you . You received it and have put your faith in it .
46015002	Because you believed the good news , you are saved . But you must hold firmly to the message I preached to you . If you don't , you have believed it for nothing .
46015003	What I received I passed on to you . And it is the most important of all . Here is what it is . Christ died for our sins , just as Scripture said he would .
46015004	He was buried . He was raised from the dead on the third day , just as Scripture said he would be .
46015005	He appeared to Peter . Then he appeared to the Twelve .
46015006	After that , he appeared to more than 500 believers at the same time . Most of them are still living . But some have died .
46015007	He appeared to James . Then he appeared to all the apostles .
46015008	Last of all , he also appeared to me . I was like someone who wasn't born at the right time or in a normal way .
46015009	I am the least important of the apostles . I'm not even fit to be called an apostle . I tried to destroy God's church .
46015010	But because of God's grace I am what I am . And his grace was not wasted on me . No , I have worked harder than all the other apostles . But I didn't do the work . God's grace was with me .
46015011	So whether it was I or the other apostles who preached to you , that is what we preach . And that is what you believed .
46015012	We have preached that Christ has been raised from the dead . So how can some of you say that no one rises from the dead ?
46015013	If no one rises from the dead , then not even Christ has been raised .
46015014	And if Christ has not been raised , what we preach doesn't mean anything . Your faith doesn't mean anything either .
46015015	More than that , we would be lying about God . We have given witness that God raised Christ from the dead . But he did not raise him if the dead are not raised .
46015016	If the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised either .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith doesn't mean anything . Your sins have not been forgiven .
46015018	Those who have died believing in Christ are also lost .
46015019	Do we have hope in Christ only for this life ? Then people should pity us more than anyone else .
46015020	But Christ really has been raised from the dead . He is the first of all those who will rise .
46015021	Death came because of what a man did . Rising from the dead also comes because of what a man did .
46015022	Because of Adam , all people die . So because of Christ , all will be made alive .
46015023	But here is the order of events . Christ is the first of those who rise from the dead . When he comes back , those who belong to him will be raised .
46015024	Then the end will come . Christ will destroy all rule , authority and power . He will hand over the kingdom to God the Father .
46015025	Christ must rule until he has put all his enemies under his control .
46015026	The last enemy that will be destroyed is death .
46015027	Scripture says that God " has put everything under his control . " It says that " everything " has been put under him . But it is clear that this does not include God himself , who puts everything under Christ .
46015028	When he has done that , the Son also will be under God's rule . God puts everything under the Son . In that way , God will be all in all .
46015029	Suppose no one rises from the dead . Then what will people do who are baptized for the dead ? Suppose the dead are not raised at all . Then why are people baptized for them ?
46015030	And why would we put ourselves in danger every hour ?
46015031	I die every day . I really mean that , brothers and sisters . Here is something you can be sure of . I take pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done for you through my work .
46015032	Did I fight wild animals in Ephesus for only human reasons ? Then what have I gotten for it ? If the dead are not raised , " Let us eat and drink , because tomorrow we will die . "
46015033	Don't let anyone fool you . " Bad companions make a good person bad . "
46015034	You should come back to your senses and stop sinning . Some of you don't know anything about God . I say this to make you ashamed .
46015035	But someone might ask , " How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have ? "
46015036	How foolish ! What you plant doesn't come to life unless it dies .
46015037	When you plant something , it isn't a completely grown plant that you put in the ground . You only plant a seed . Maybe it's wheat or something else .
46015038	But God gives the seed a body just as he has planned . And to each kind of seed he gives its own body .
46015039	All earthly creatures are not the same . People have one kind of body . Animals have another . Birds have another kind . Fish have still another .
46015040	There are also heavenly bodies as well as earthly bodies . Heavenly bodies have one kind of glory . Earthly bodies have another .
46015041	The sun has one kind of glory . The moon has another kind . The stars have still another . And one star's glory is different from that of another star .
46015042	It will be like that with bodies that are raised from the dead . The body that is planted does not last forever . The body that is raised from the dead lasts forever .
46015043	It is planted without honor . But it is raised in glory . It is planted in weakness . But it is raised in power .
46015044	It is planted as an earthly body . But it is raised as a spiritual body . Just as there is an earthly body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	It is written , " The first man Adam became a living person . " The last Adam became a spirit that gives life .
46015046	What is spiritual did not come first . What is earthly came first . What is spiritual came after that .
46015047	The first man came from the dust of the earth . The second man came from heaven .
46015048	Those who belong to the earth are like the one who came from the earth . And those who are spiritual are like the one who came from heaven .
46015049	We are like the earthly man . And we will be like the man from heaven .
46015050	Brothers and sisters , here is what I'm telling you . Bodies made of flesh and blood can't share in the kingdom of God . And what dies can't share in what never dies .
46015051	Listen ! I am telling you a mystery . We will not all die . But we will all be changed .
46015052	That will happen in a flash , as quickly as you can wink an eye . It will happen when the last trumpet sounds . The trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised to live forever . And we will be changed .
46015053	Our natural bodies don't last forever . They must be dressed with what does last forever . What dies must be dressed with what does not die .
46015054	In fact , that is going to happen . What does not last will be dressed with what lasts forever . What dies will be dressed with what does not die . Then what is written will come true . It says , " Death has been swallowed up . It has lost the battle . "
46015055	" Death , where is the battle you thought you were winning ? Death , where is your sting ? "
46015056	The sting of death is sin . And the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But let us give thanks to God ! He wins the battle for us because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done .
46015058	My dear brothers and sisters , stand firm . Don't let anything move you . Always give yourselves completely to the work of the Lord . Because you belong to the Lord , you know that your work is not worthless .
46016001	Now I want to deal with the offering of money for God's people . Do what I told the churches in Galatia to do .
46016002	On the first day of every week , each of you should put some money away . The amount should be in keeping with how much money you make . Save the money so that you won't have to take up an offering when I come .
46016003	When I arrive , I will send some people with your gift to Jerusalem . They will be people you consider to be good . And I will give them letters that explain who they are .
46016004	If it seems good for me to go also , they will go with me .
46016005	After I go through Macedonia , I will come to you . I will only be passing through Macedonia .
46016006	But I might stay with you for a while . I might even spend the winter . Then you can help me on my journey everywhere I go .
46016007	I don't want to see you now while I am just passing through . I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord allows it .
46016008	But I will stay at Ephesus until the day of Pentecost .
46016009	A door has opened wide for me to do some good work here . There are many people who oppose me .
46016010	Timothy might come to you . Make sure he has nothing to worry about while he is with you . He is doing the work of the Lord , just as I am .
46016011	No one should refuse to accept him . Send him safely on his way so he can return to me . I'm expecting him to come back along with the others .
46016012	I want to say something about our brother Apollos . I tried my best to get him to go to you with the others . But he didn't want to go right now . He will go when he can .
46016013	Be on your guard . Stand firm in the faith . Be brave . Be strong .
46016014	Be loving in everything you do .
46016015	You know that the first believers in Achaia were from the family of Stephanas . They have spent all their time serving God's people . Brothers and sisters , I am asking you
46016016	to follow the lead of people like them . Follow everyone who joins in the task and works hard at it .
46016017	I was glad when Stephanas , Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived . They have supplied me with what you couldn't give me .
46016018	They renewed my spirit , and yours also . People like that are worthy of honor .
46016019	The churches in Asia Minor send you greetings . Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly because of the Lord's love . So does the church that meets in their house .
46016020	All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	I , Paul , am writing this greeting with my own hand .
46016022	If anyone does not love the Lord , let a curse be on that person ! Come , Lord !
46016023	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	I give my love to all of you who belong to Christ Jesus . Amen .
47001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . Timothy our brother joins me in writing . We are sending this letter to you , the members of God's church in Corinth . It is also for all of God's people everywhere in Achaia .
47001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
47001003	Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! He is the Father who gives tender love . All comfort comes from him .
47001004	He comforts us in all our troubles . Now we can comfort others when they are in trouble . We ourselves have received comfort from God .
47001005	We share the sufferings of Christ . We also share his comfort .
47001006	If we are having trouble , it is so that you will be comforted and renewed . If we are comforted , it is so that you will be comforted . Then you will be able to put up with the same suffering we have gone through .
47001007	Our hope for you remains firm . We know that you suffer just as we do . In the same way , God comforts you just as he comforts us .
47001008	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the hard times we suffered in Asia Minor . We were having a lot of trouble . It was far more than we could stand . We even thought we were going to die .
47001009	In fact , in our hearts we felt as if we were under the sentence of death . But that happened so that we would not depend on ourselves but on God . He raises the dead to life .
47001010	God has saved us from deadly dangers . And he will continue to do it . We have put our hope in him . He will continue to save us .
47001011	You must help us by praying for us . Then many people will give thanks because of what will happen to us . They will thank God for his kindness to us in answer to the prayers of many .
47001012	Here is what we take pride in . Our sense of what is right and wrong gives witness that we have acted in God's holy and honest ways . That is how we live in the world . We live that way most of all when we are dealing with you . Our way of living is not wise in the eyes of the world . But it is in keeping with God's grace .
47001013	We are writing only what you can read and understand . And here is what I hope .
47001014	Up to this point you have understood some of the things we have said . But now I hope that someday you will be able to take pride in us , just as we will take pride in you on the day the Lord Jesus returns . When you are able to do that , you will understand us completely .
47001015	I was sure of those things . So I planned to visit you first . Here is how I thought you would be helped twice .
47001016	I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia . I would have come back to you from there . Then you would have sent me on my way to Judea .
47001017	When I planned all of that , did I do it without much thought ? No . I don't make my plans the way the world makes theirs . In the same breath the world says , " Yes ! Yes ! " and " No ! No ! "
47001018	But just as sure as God is faithful , our message to you is not " Yes " and " No . "
47001019	Silas , Timothy and I preached to you about the Son of God , Jesus Christ . Our message did not say " Yes " and " No " at the same time . The message of Christ has always been " Yes . "
47001020	God has made a great many promises . They are all " Yes " because of what Christ has done . So through Christ we say " Amen . " We want God to receive glory .
47001021	He makes both us and you stand firm because we belong to Christ . He anointed us .
47001022	He put his Spirit in our hearts and marked us as his own . We can now be sure that he will give us everything he promised us .
47001023	I call God as my witness . I wanted to spare you . So I didn't return to Corinth .
47001024	Your faith is not under our control . You stand firm in your own faith . But we work together with you for your joy .
47002001	So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you .
47002002	If I make you sad , who is going to make me glad ? Only you , the one I made sad .
47002003	I wrote what I did for a special reason . When I came , I didn't want to be troubled by those who should make me glad . I was sure that all of you would share my joy .
47002004	I was very troubled when I wrote to you . My heart was sad . My eyes were full of tears . I didn't want to make you sad . I wanted to let you know that I love you very deeply .
47002005	Suppose someone has made us sad . In some ways , he hasn't made me sad so much as he has made all of you sad . But I don't want to put this too strongly .
47002006	He has been punished because most of you decided he should be . That is enough for him .
47002007	Now you should forgive him and comfort him . Then he won't be sad more than he can stand .
47002008	So I'm asking you to tell him again that you still love him .
47002009	I wrote to you for a special reason . I wanted to see if you could stand the test . I wanted to see if you could obey everything that was asked of you .
47002010	Anyone you forgive I also forgive . Was there anything to forgive ? If so , I have forgiven it for your benefit , knowing that Christ is watching .
47002011	We don't want Satan to outsmart us . We know how he does his evil work .
47002012	I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ . There I found that the Lord had opened a door of opportunity for me .
47002013	But I still had no peace of mind . I couldn't find my brother Titus there . So I said good-by to the believers at Troas and went on to Macedonia .
47002014	Give thanks to God ! He always leads us in the winners' parade because we belong to Christ . Through us , God spreads the knowledge of Christ everywhere like perfume .
47002015	God considers us to be the sweet smell that Christ is spreading among people who are being saved and people who are dying .
47002016	To the one , we are the smell of death . To the other , we are the perfume of life . Who is able to do that work ?
47002017	Unlike many people , we aren't selling God's word to make money . In fact , it is just the opposite . Because of Christ we speak honestly before God . We speak like people God has sent .
47003001	Are we beginning to praise ourselves again ? Some people need letters that speak well of them . Do we need those kinds of letters , either to you or from you ?
47003002	You yourselves are our letter . You are written on our hearts . Everyone knows you and reads you .
47003003	You make it clear that you are a letter from Christ . You are the result of our work for God . You are a letter written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God . You are a letter written not on tablets made out of stone but on human hearts .
47003004	Through Christ , we can be sure of this because of our faith in God's power .
47003005	In ourselves we are not able to claim anything for ourselves . The power to do what we do comes from God .
47003006	He has given us the power to serve under a new covenant . The covenant is not based on the written Law of Moses . It comes from the Holy Spirit . The written Law kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	The Law was written in letters on stone . Even though it was a way of serving God , it led to death . But even that way of serving God came with glory . And even though the glory was fading , the people of Israel couldn't look at Moses' face very long .
47003008	Since all of that is true , won't the work of the Holy Spirit be even more glorious ?
47003009	The Law that sentences people to death is glorious . How much more glorious is the work of the Spirit ! His work makes people right with God .
47003010	The glory of the old covenant is nothing compared with the far greater glory of the new .
47003011	The glory of the old is fading away . How much greater is the glory of the new ! It will last forever .
47003012	Since we have that kind of hope , we are very bold .
47003013	We are not like Moses . He used to cover his face with a veil . That was to keep the people of Israel from looking at his face while the brightness was fading away .
47003014	But their minds were made stubborn . To this very day , the same veil remains when the old covenant is read . The veil has not been removed . Only faith in Christ can take it away .
47003015	To this very day , when the Law of Moses is read , a veil covers the minds of those who hear it .
47003016	But when anyone turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Holy Spirit . And where the Spirit of the Lord is , freedom is also there .
47003018	Our faces are not covered with a veil . We all display the Lord's glory . We are being changed to become more like him so that we have more and more glory . And the glory comes from the Lord , who is the Holy Spirit .
47004001	So because of God's mercy , we have work to do . He has given it to us . And we don't give up .
47004002	Instead , we have given up doing secret and shameful things . We don't twist God's word . In fact , we do just the opposite . We present the truth plainly . In the sight of God , we make our appeal to everyone's sense of what is right and wrong .
47004003	Suppose our good news is covered with a veil . Then it is veiled to those who are dying .
47004004	The god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't believe . They can't see the light of the good news of Christ's glory . He is the likeness of God .
47004005	We do not preach about ourselves . We preach about Jesus Christ . We say that he is Lord . And we serve you because of him .
47004006	God said , " Let light shine out of darkness . " He made his light shine in our hearts . It shows us the light of God's glory in the face of Christ .
47004007	Treasure is kept in clay jars . In the same way , we have the treasure of the good news in these earthly bodies of ours . That shows that the mighty power of the good news comes from God . It doesn't come from us .
47004008	We are pushed hard from all sides . But we are not beaten down . We are bewildered . But that doesn't make us lose hope .
47004009	Others make us suffer . But God does not desert us . We are knocked down . But we are not knocked out .
47004010	We always carry around the death of Jesus in our bodies . In that way , the life of Jesus can be shown in our bodies .
47004011	We who are alive are always in danger of death because we are serving Jesus . So his life can be shown in our earthly bodies .
47004012	Death is at work in us . But life is at work in you .
47004013	It is written , " I believed , and so I have spoken . " With that same spirit of faith we also believe . And we also speak .
47004014	We know that God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead . And he will also raise us up with Jesus . He will bring us with you to God in heaven .
47004015	All of that is for your benefit . God's grace is reaching more and more people . So they will become more and more thankful . They will give glory to God .
47004016	We don't give up . Our bodies are becoming weaker and weaker . But our spirits are being renewed day by day .
47004017	Our troubles are small . They last only for a short time . But they are earning for us a glory that will last forever . It is greater than all our troubles .
47004018	So we don't spend all our time looking at what we can see . Instead , we look at what we can't see . What can be seen lasts only a short time . But what can't be seen will last forever .
47005001	We know that the earthly tent we live in will be destroyed . But we have a building made by God . It is a house in heaven that lasts forever . Human hands did not build it .
47005002	During our time on earth we groan . We long to put on our house in heaven as if it were clothing .
47005003	Then we will not be naked .
47005004	While we live in this tent of ours , we groan under our heavy load . We don't want to be naked . We want to be dressed with our house in heaven . What must die will be swallowed up by life .
47005005	God has made us for that very purpose . He has given us the Holy Spirit as a down payment . The Spirit makes us sure of what is still to come .
47005006	So here is what we can always be certain about . As long as we are at home in our bodies , we are away from the Lord .
47005007	We live by believing , not by seeing .
47005008	We are certain about that . We would rather be away from our bodies and at home with the Lord .
47005009	So we try our best to please him . We want to please him whether we are at home in our bodies or away from them .
47005010	We must all stand in front of Christ to be judged . Each one of us will be judged for the good things and the bad things we do while we are in our bodies . Then each of us will receive what we are supposed to get .
47005011	We know what it means to have respect for the Lord . So we try to help other people to understand it . What we are is plain to God . I hope it is also plain to your way of thinking .
47005012	We are not trying to make an appeal to you again . But we are giving you a chance to take pride in us . Then you can answer those who take pride in how people look rather than in what is really in their hearts .
47005013	Are we out of our minds ? That is because we want to serve God . Does what we say make sense ? That is because we want to serve you .
47005014	Christ's love controls us . We are sure that one person died for everyone . And so everyone died .
47005015	Christ died for everyone . He died so that those who live should not live for themselves anymore . They should live for Christ . He died for them and was raised again .
47005016	So from now on we don't look at anyone the way the world does . At one time we looked at Christ in that way . But we don't anymore .
47005017	Anyone who believes in Christ is a new creation . The old is gone ! The new has come !
47005018	It is all from God . He brought us back to himself through Christ's death on the cross . And he has given us the task of bringing others back to him through Christ .
47005019	God was bringing the world back to himself through Christ . He did not hold people's sins against them . God has trusted us with the message that people may be brought back to him .
47005020	So we are Christ's official messengers . It is as if God were making his appeal through us . Here is what Christ wants us to beg you to do . Come back to God !
47005021	Christ didn't have any sin . But God made him become sin for us . So we can be made right with God because of what Christ has done for us .
47006001	We work together with God . So we are asking you not to receive God's grace and then do nothing with it .
47006002	He says , " When I showed you my favor , I heard you . On the day I saved you , I helped you . " I tell you , now is the time God shows his favor . Now is the day he saves .
47006003	We don't put anything in anyone's way . So no one can find fault with our work for God .
47006004	Instead , we make it clear that we serve God in every way . We serve him by holding steady . We stand firm in all kinds of trouble , hard times and suffering .
47006005	We don't give up when we are beaten or put in prison . When people stir up trouble in the streets , we continue to serve God . We work hard for him . We go without sleep and food .
47006006	We remain pure . We understand completely what it means to serve God . We are patient and kind . We serve him in the power of the Holy Spirit . We serve him with true love .
47006007	We speak the truth . We serve in the power of God . We hold the weapons of godliness in the right hand and in the left .
47006008	We serve God in times of glory and shame . We serve him whether the news about us is bad or good . We are true to our calling . But people treat us as if we were pretenders .
47006009	We are known , but people treat us as if we were unknown . We are dying , but we continue to live . We are beaten , but we are not killed .
47006010	We are sad , but we are always full of joy . We are poor , but we make many people rich . We have nothing , but we own everything .
47006011	Believers at Corinth , we have spoken freely to you . We have opened our hearts wide to you .
47006012	We are not holding back our love from you . But you are holding back your love from us .
47006013	I speak to you as if you were my children . It is only fair that you open your hearts wide to us also .
47006014	Do not be joined to unbelievers . What do right and wrong have in common ? Can light and darkness be friends ?
47006015	How can Christ and Satan agree ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	How can the temple of the true God and the statues of other gods agree ? We are the temple of the living God . God has said , " I will live with them . I will walk among them . I will be their God . And they will be my people . "
47006017	" So come out from among them and be separate , says the Lord . Do not touch anything that is not pure and clean . Then I will receive you . "
47006018	" I will be your Father . You will be my sons and daughters , says the Lord who rules over all . "
47007001	Dear friends , we have these promises from God . So let us make ourselves pure from everything that pollutes our bodies and spirits . Let us be completely holy . We want to honor God .
47007002	Make room for us in your hearts . We haven't done anything wrong to anyone . We haven't caused anyone to sin . We haven't taken advantage of anyone .
47007003	I don't say this to judge you . I have told you before that you have an important place in our hearts . We would live or die with you .
47007004	I have great faith in you . I am very proud of you . I am very happy . Even with all our troubles , my joy has no limit .
47007005	When I came to Macedonia , my body wasn't able to rest . I was attacked no matter where I went . I had battles on the outside and fears on the inside .
47007006	But God comforts those who are sad . He comforted me when Titus came .
47007007	I was comforted not only when he came but also by the comfort you had given him . He told me how much you longed for me . He told me about your deep sadness and concern for me . That made my joy greater than ever .
47007008	Even if my letter made you sad , I'm not sorry I sent it . At first I was sorry . I see that my letter hurt you , but only for a little while .
47007009	Now I am happy . I'm not happy because you were made sad . I'm happy because your sadness led you to turn away from your sins . You became sad just as God wanted you to . So you were not hurt in any way by us .
47007010	Godly sadness causes us to turn away from our sins and be saved . And we are certainly not sorry about that ! But worldly sadness brings death .
47007011	Look at what that godly sadness has produced in you . You are working hard to clear yourselves . You are angry and alarmed . You are longing to see me . You are concerned . You are ready to make sure that the right thing is done . In every way you have proved that you are not guilty in that matter .
47007012	So even though I wrote to you , it wasn't because of the one who did the wrong . It wasn't because of the one who was hurt . Instead , I wrote you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how faithful you are to us .
47007013	All of that cheers us up . We were also very glad to see how happy Titus was . You have all renewed his spirit .
47007014	I had bragged about you to him . And you have not let me down . Everything we said to you was true . In the same way , our bragging about you to Titus has also turned out to be true .
47007015	His love for you is even greater when he remembers that you all obeyed his teaching . You received him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I am glad I can have complete faith in you .
47008001	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the grace that God has given to the churches in Macedonia .
47008002	They have suffered a great deal . But their joy was more than full . Even though they were very poor , they gave very freely .
47008003	I give witness that they gave as much as they could . In fact , they gave even more than they could . Completely on their own ,
47008004	they begged us for the chance to share in serving God's people in that way .
47008005	They did more than we expected . First they gave themselves to the Lord . Then they gave themselves to us in keeping with what God wanted .
47008006	Titus had already started collecting money from you . So we asked him to get you to finish making your kind gift .
47008007	You do well in everything else . You do well in faith and in speaking . You do well in knowledge and in complete commitment . And you do well in your love for us . So make sure that you also do well in the grace of giving to others .
47008008	I am not commanding you to do it . But I want to put you to the test . I want to find out if you really love God . I want to compare your love with that of others .
47008009	You know the grace shown by our Lord Jesus Christ . Even though he was rich , he became poor to help you . Because he became poor , you can become rich .
47008010	Here is my advice about what is best for you in that matter . Last year you were the first to give . You were also the first to want to give .
47008011	So finish the work . Then your longing to do it will be matched by your finishing it . Give on the basis of what you have .
47008012	Do you really want to give ? Then the gift is received in keeping with what you have , not with what you don't have .
47008013	We don't want others to have it easy at your expense . We want things to be equal .
47008014	Right now you have plenty in order to take care of what they need . Then they will have plenty to take care of what you need . That will make things equal .
47008015	It is written , " Those who gathered a lot didn't have too much . And those who gathered a little had enough . "
47008016	God put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you . I am thankful to God for this .
47008017	Titus welcomed our appeal . He is also excited about coming to you . It was his own idea .
47008018	Along with Titus , we are sending another brother . All the churches praise him for his service in telling the good news .
47008019	He was also chosen by the churches to go with us as we bring the offering . We are in charge of it . We want to honor the Lord himself . We want to show how ready we are to help .
47008020	We want to keep anyone from blaming us for how we take care of that large gift .
47008021	We are trying hard to do what is right in the Lord's eyes and in the eyes of people .
47008022	We are also sending another one of our brothers with them . He has often proved to us in many ways that he is very committed . He is now even more committed because he has great faith in you .
47008023	Titus is my helper . He and I work together among you . Our brothers are messengers from the churches . They honor Christ .
47008024	So show them that you really love them . Show them why we are proud of you . Then the churches can see it .
47009001	I don't need to write to you about giving to God's people .
47009002	I know how much you want to help . I have been bragging about it to the people in Macedonia . I have been telling them that since last year you who live in Achaia were ready to give . You are so excited that it has stirred up most of them to take action .
47009003	But I am sending the brothers . Then our bragging about you in this matter will have a good reason . You will be ready , just as I said you would be .
47009004	Suppose people from Macedonia come with me and find out that you are not prepared . Then we , as well as you , would be ashamed of being so certain .
47009005	So I thought I should try to get the brothers to visit you ahead of time . They will finish the plans for the large gift you had promised . Then it will be ready as a gift that is freely given . It will not be given by force .
47009006	Here is something to remember . The one who plants only a little will gather only a little . And the one who plants a lot will gather a lot .
47009007	You should each give what you have decided in your heart to give . You shouldn't give if you don't want to . You shouldn't give because you are forced to . God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	And God is able to shower all kinds of blessings on you . In all things and at all times you will have everything you need . You will do more and more good works .
47009009	It is written , " They have spread their gifts around to poor people . Their good works continue forever . "
47009010	God supplies seed to the planter . He supplies bread for food . God will also supply and increase the amount of your seed . He will increase the results of your good works .
47009011	You will be made rich in every way . Then you can always give freely . We will take your many gifts to the people who need them . And they will give thanks to God .
47009012	Your gifts meet the needs of God's people . And that's not all . Your gifts also cause many people to thank God .
47009013	You have shown yourselves to be worthy by what you have given . So people will praise God because you obey him . That proves that you really believe the good news about Christ . They will also praise God because you share freely with them and with everyone else .
47009014	Their hearts will be filled with longing for you when they pray for you . God has given you grace that is better than anything .
47009015	Let us give thanks to God for his gift . It is so great that no one can tell how wonderful it really is !
47010001	Christ is gentle and free of pride . So I make my appeal to you . I , Paul , am the one you call shy when I am face to face with you . But when I am away from you , you call me bold .
47010002	I beg you that when I come I won't have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people . They think that I live the way the people of this world live .
47010003	I do live in the world . But I don't fight my battles the way the people of the world do .
47010004	The weapons I fight with are not the weapons the world uses . In fact , it is just the opposite . My weapons have the power of God to destroy the camps of the enemy .
47010005	I destroy every claim and every reason that keeps people from knowing God . I keep every thought under control in order to make it obey Christ .
47010006	Until you have obeyed completely , I will be ready to punish you every time you don't obey .
47010007	You are looking only at what appears on the surface of things . Suppose you are sure you belong to Christ . Then you should consider again that I belong to Christ just as much as you do .
47010008	Do I brag too much about the authority the Lord gave me ? If I do , it's because I want to build you up , not pull you down . And I'm not ashamed of that kind of bragging .
47010009	Don't think that I'm trying to scare you with my letters .
47010010	Some say , " His letters sound important . They are powerful . But in person he doesn't seem like much . And what he says doesn't amount to anything . "
47010011	People like that have a lot to learn . What I say in my letters when I'm away from you , I will do in my actions when I'm with you .
47010012	I don't dare to compare myself with those who praise themselves . I'm not that kind of person . They measure themselves by themselves . They compare themselves with themselves . When they do that , they are not wise .
47010013	But I won't brag more than I should . Instead , I will brag only about what I have done in the area God has given me . It is an area that reaches all the way to you .
47010014	I am not going too far in my bragging . I would be going too far if I hadn't come to where you live . But I did get there with the good news about Christ .
47010015	And I won't brag about work done by others . If I did , I would be bragging more than I should . As your faith continues to grow , I hope that my work among you will greatly increase .
47010016	Then I will be able to preach the good news in the areas beyond you . I don't want to brag about work already done in someone else's territory .
47010017	But , " The one who brags should brag about what the Lord has done . "
47010018	Those who praise themselves are not accepted . Those the Lord praises are accepted .
47011001	I hope you will put up with a little of my foolish bragging . But you are already doing that .
47011002	My jealousy for you comes from God himself . I promised to give you to only one husband . That husband is Christ . I wanted to be able to give you to him as if you were a pure virgin .
47011003	But Eve was tricked by the snake's clever lies . And I'm afraid that in the same way your minds will somehow be led down the wrong path . They will be led away from your true and pure love for Christ .
47011004	Suppose someone comes to you and preaches about a Jesus different from the Jesus we preached about . Or suppose you receive a spirit different from the one you received before . Or suppose you receive a message of good news different from the one you accepted earlier . You put up with those kinds of things easily enough .
47011005	But I don't think I'm in any way less important than those " super-apostles . "
47011006	I may not be a trained speaker . But I do have knowledge . I've made that very clear to you in every way .
47011007	When I preached God's good news to you free of charge , I put myself down in order to lift you up . Was that a sin ?
47011008	Did I rob other churches when I received help from them so that I could serve you ?
47011009	When I was with you and needed something , I didn't cause you any expense . The believers who came from Macedonia gave me what I needed . I haven't caused you any expense at all . And I won't ever do it .
47011010	I'm sure that the truth of Christ is in me . And I'm just as sure that nobody in Achaia will keep me from bragging .
47011011	Why ? Because I don't love you ? No ! God knows I do !
47011012	And I will keep on doing what I'm doing . That will stop those who claim they have things to brag about . They think they have a chance to be considered equal with us .
47011013	People like that are false apostles . They work hard to trick others . They only pretend to be apostles of Christ .
47011014	That comes as no surprise . Even Satan himself pretends to be an angel of light .
47011015	So it doesn't surprise us that those who serve Satan pretend to be serving God . They will finally get exactly what they should .
47011016	I will say it again . Don't let anyone think I'm a fool . But if you do , receive me just as you would receive a fool . Then I can do a little bragging .
47011017	When I brag about myself like this , I'm not talking the way the Lord would . I'm talking like a fool .
47011018	Many are bragging the way the people of the world do . So I will brag like that too .
47011019	You are so wise ! You gladly put up with fools !
47011020	In fact , you even put up with anyone who makes you a slave or uses you . You put up with those who take advantage of you . You put up with those who claim to be better than you . You put up with those who slap you in the face .
47011021	I'm ashamed to have to say that I was too weak for that ! What anyone else dares to brag about , I also dare to brag about . I'm speaking like a fool !
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Do they belong to the people of Israel ? So do I . Are they Abraham's children ? So am I .
47011023	Are they serving Christ ? I am serving him even more . I'm out of my mind to talk like this ! I have worked much harder . I have been in prison more often . I have suffered terrible beatings . Again and again I almost died .
47011024	Five times the Jews gave me 39 strokes with a whip .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with sticks . Once they tried to kill me by throwing stones at me . Three times I was shipwrecked . I spent a night and a day in the open sea .
47011026	I have had to keep on the move . I have been in danger from rivers . I have been in danger from robbers . I have been in danger from people from my own country . I have been in danger from those who aren't Jews . I have been in danger in the city , in the country , and at sea . I have been in danger from people who pretended they were believers .
47011027	I have worked very hard . Often I have gone without sleep . I have been hungry and thirsty . Often I have gone without food . I have been cold and naked .
47011028	Besides everything else , every day I am concerned about all the churches . It is a very heavy load .
47011029	If anyone is weak , I feel weak . If anyone is led into sin , I burn on the inside .
47011030	If I have to brag , I will brag about the things that show how weak I am .
47011031	I am not lying . The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows this . May God be praised forever .
47011032	In Damascus the governor who served under King Aretas had their city guarded . He wanted to arrest me .
47011033	But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall . So I slipped through the governor's hands .
47012001	We can't gain anything by bragging . But I have to do it anyway . I am going to tell you what I've seen . I want to talk about what the Lord has shown me .
47012002	I know a believer in Christ who was taken up to the third heaven 14 years ago . I don't know if his body was taken up or not . Only God knows .
47012003	I don't know if that man was in his body or out of it . Only God knows . But I do know that
47012004	he was taken up to paradise . He heard things that couldn't be put into words . They were things that people aren't allowed to talk about .
47012005	I will brag about a man like that . But I won't brag about myself . I will brag only about how weak I am .
47012006	Suppose I decide to brag . That would not make me a fool , because I would be telling the truth . But I don't do it . Then no one will think more of me than he should because of what I do or say .
47012007	I could have become proud of myself because of the amazing and wonderful things God has shown me . So I was given a problem that caused pain in my body . It is a messenger from Satan to make me suffer .
47012008	Three times I begged the Lord to take it away from me .
47012009	But he said to me , " My grace is all you need . My power is strongest when you are weak . " So I am very happy to brag about how weak I am . Then Christ's power can rest on me .
47012010	Because of how I suffered for Christ , I'm glad that I am weak . I am glad in hard times . I am glad when people say mean things about me . I am glad when things are difficult . And I am glad when people make me suffer . When I am weak , I am strong .
47012011	I have made a fool of myself . But you made me do it . You should have praised me . Even though I am nothing , I am in no way less important than the " super-apostles . "
47012012	You can recognize apostles by the signs , wonders and miracles they do . Those things were faithfully done among you no matter what happened .
47012013	How were you less important than the other churches ? The only difference was that I didn't cause you any expense . Forgive me for that wrong !
47012014	Now I am ready to visit you for the third time . I won't cause you any expense . I don't want what you have . What I really want is you . After all , children shouldn't have to save up for their parents . Parents should save up for their children .
47012015	So I will be very happy to spend everything I have for you . I will even spend myself . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
47012016	In any case , I haven't caused you any expense . But I'm such a tricky fellow ! I have caught you by tricking you !
47012017	Did I take advantage of you through any of the men I sent to you ?
47012018	I asked Titus to go to you . And I sent our brother with him . Titus didn't take advantage of you , did he ? Didn't I act in the same spirit ? Didn't I follow the same path ?
47012019	All this time , have you been thinking that I've been speaking up for myself ? No , I've been speaking with God as my witness . I've been speaking like a believer in Christ . Dear friends , everything I do is to help you become stronger .
47012020	I'm afraid that when I come I won't find you as I want you to be . I'm afraid that you won't find me as you want me to be . I'm afraid there will be arguing , jealousy and fits of anger . I'm afraid you will separate into your own little groups . Then you will tell lies about each other . You will talk about each other . I'm afraid you will be proud and cause trouble .
47012021	I'm afraid that when I come again my God will put me to shame in front of you . Then I will be sad about many who sinned earlier and have not turned away from it . They have not turned away from uncleanness , sexual sins and wild living . They have done all those things .
47013001	This will be my third visit to you . Scripture says , " Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses . "
47013002	I already warned you during my second visit . I now say it again while I'm away . When I return , I won't spare those who sinned earlier . I won't spare any of the others either .
47013003	You are asking me to prove that Christ is speaking through me . He is not weak in dealing with you . He is powerful among you .
47013004	It is true that Christ was nailed to the cross because he was weak . But he lives by God's power . In the same way , I share his weakness . But by God's power I will live with him to serve you .
47013005	Take a good look at yourselves to see if you are really believers . Test yourselves . Don't you realize that Christ Jesus is in you ? Unless , of course , you fail the test !
47013006	I hope you will discover that I haven't failed the test .
47013007	I pray to God that you won't do anything wrong . I don't pray so that people will see that I have passed the test . Instead , I pray so that you will do what is right , even if it seems I have failed .
47013008	I can't do anything to stop the truth . I can only work for the truth .
47013009	I'm glad when I am weak but you are strong . I pray that you will become perfect .
47013010	That's why I write these things before I come to you . Then when I do come , I won't have to be hard on you when I use my authority . The Lord gave me the authority to build you up . He didn't give it to me to tear you down .
47013011	Finally , brothers and sisters , good-by . Try to be perfect . Pay attention to what I'm saying . Agree with one another . Live in peace . And the God who gives love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All of God's people send their greetings .
47013014	May the grace shown by the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love that God has given us , and the sharing of life brought about by the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle . People have not sent me . No human authority has sent me . I have been sent by Jesus Christ and by God the Father . God raised Jesus from the dead .
48001002	All the brothers who are with me join me in writing . We are sending this letter to you , the members of the churches in Galatia .
48001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
48001004	Jesus gave his life for our sins . He set us free from this evil world . That was what our God and Father wanted .
48001005	Give glory to God for ever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I am amazed . You are so quickly deserting the One who chose you because of the grace that Christ has provided . You are turning to a different " good news . "
48001007	What you are accepting is really not the good news at all . It seems that some people have gotten you all mixed up . They are trying to twist the good news about Christ .
48001008	But suppose even we should preach a different " good news . " Suppose even an angel from heaven should preach it . I'm talking about a different one than the good news we gave you . Let anyone who does that be judged by God forever .
48001009	I have already said it . Now I will say it again . Anyone who preaches a " good news " that is different from the one you accepted should be judged by God forever .
48001010	Am I now trying to get people to think well of me ? Or do I want God to think well of me ? Am I trying to please people ? If I were , I would not be serving Christ .
48001011	Brothers and sisters , here is what I want you to know . The good news I preached is not something a human being made up .
48001012	No one gave it to me . No one taught it to me . Instead , I received it from Jesus Christ . He showed it to me .
48001013	You have heard of my earlier way of life as a Jew . With all my strength I attacked the church of God . I tried to destroy it .
48001014	I was moving ahead in my Jewish way of life . I went beyond many Jews who were my own age . I held firmly to the teachings passed down by my people .
48001015	But God set me apart from the time I was born . He showed me his grace by appointing me . He was pleased
48001016	to show his Son in my life . He wanted me to preach about Jesus among those who aren't Jews . When God appointed me , I didn't talk to anyone .
48001017	I didn't go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was . Instead , I went at once into Arabia . Later I returned to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem . I went there to get to know Peter . I stayed with him for 15 days .
48001019	I didn't see any of the other apostles . I only saw James , the Lord's brother .
48001020	Here is what you can be sure of . And God gives witness to it . What I am writing you is not a lie .
48001021	Later I went to Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	The members of Christ's churches in Judea did not know me in a personal way .
48001023	They only heard others say , " The man who used to attack us has changed . He is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy . "
48001024	And they praised God because of me .
48002001	Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem . This time I went with Barnabas . I took Titus along also .
48002002	I went because God showed me what he wanted me to do . I told the people there the good news that I preach among those who aren't Jews . But I spoke in private to those who seemed to be leaders . I was afraid that I was running or had run my race for nothing .
48002003	Titus was with me . He was a Greek . But even he was not forced to be circumcised .
48002004	That matter came up because some who pretended to be believers had slipped in among us . They wanted to find out about the freedom we have because we belong to Christ Jesus . They wanted to make us slaves again .
48002005	We didn't give in to them for a moment . We wanted the truth of the good news to remain with you .
48002006	Some people in Jerusalem seemed to be important . It makes no difference to me what they were . God does not judge by what he sees on the outside . Those people added nothing to my message .
48002007	In fact , it was just the opposite . They saw that I had been trusted with the task of preaching the good news just as Peter had been . My task was to preach to the non-Jews . Peter's task was to preach to the Jews .
48002008	God was working through Peter as an apostle to the Jews . He was also working through me as an apostle to the non-Jews .
48002009	James , Peter and John are considered to be pillars in the church . They recognized the special grace that was given to me . So they shook my hand and the hand of Barnabas . They wanted to show they accepted us . They agreed that we should go to the non-Jews . They would go to the Jews .
48002010	They asked only one thing . They wanted us to continue to remember poor people . That was what I really wanted to do anyway .
48002011	When Peter came to Antioch , I told him to his face that I was against what he was doing . He was clearly wrong .
48002012	He used to eat with those who weren't Jews . But certain men came from the group that was led by James . When they arrived , Peter began to draw back . He separated himself from the non-Jews . He was afraid of the circumcision group .
48002013	Peter's actions were not honest . The other Jews joined him . Even Barnabas was led down the wrong path .
48002014	I saw what they were doing . It was not in line with the truth of the good news . So I spoke to Peter in front of them all . " You are a Jew , " I said . " But you live like one who is not . So why do you force non-Jews to follow Jewish ways ? "
48002015	We are Jews by birth . We are not " non-Jewish sinners . "
48002016	We know that no one is made right with God by obeying the law . It is by believing in Jesus Christ . So we too have put our faith in Christ Jesus . That is so we can be made right with God by believing in Christ , not by obeying the law . No one can be made right with God by obeying the law .
48002017	We are trying to be made right with God through Christ . But it is clear that we are sinners . So does that mean that Christ causes us to sin ? Certainly not !
48002018	Suppose I build again what I had destroyed . Then I prove that I break the Law .
48002019	Because of the law , I died as far as the law is concerned . I died so that I might live for God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ . I don't live any longer . Christ lives in me . My faith in the Son of God helps me to live my life in my body . He loved me . He gave himself for me .
48002021	I do not get rid of the grace of God . What if a person could become right with God by obeying the law ? Then Christ died for nothing !
48003001	You foolish people of Galatia ! Who has put you under an evil spell ? When I preached , I clearly showed you that Jesus Christ had been nailed to the cross .
48003002	I would like to learn just one thing from you . Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law ? Or did you receive the Spirit by believing what you heard ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? You began with the Holy Spirit . Are you now trying to complete God's work in you by your own strength ?
48003004	Have you suffered so much for nothing ? And was it really for nothing ?
48003005	Why does God give you his Spirit ? Why does he work miracles among you ? Is it because you do what the law says ? Or is it because you believe what you have heard ?
48003006	Think about Abraham . Scripture says , " Abraham believed God . God accepted Abraham because he believed . So his faith made him right with God . "
48003007	So you see , those who have faith are children of Abraham .
48003008	Long ago , Scripture knew that God would make non-Jews right with himself by believing in him . He announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham . He said , " All nations will be blessed because of you . "
48003009	So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham . He was the man of faith .
48003010	All who depend on obeying the law are under a curse . It is written , " May everyone who doesn't continue to do everything that is written in the Book of the Law be under God's curse . "
48003011	We know that no one is made right with God by keeping the law . Scripture says , " Those who are right with God will live by faith . "
48003012	The law is not based on faith . In fact , it is just the opposite . It teaches that " the one who does those things will live by them . "
48003013	Christ set us free from the curse of the law . He did it by becoming a curse for us . It is written , " Everyone who is hung on a pole is under God's curse . "
48003014	Christ Jesus set us free so that the blessing given to Abraham would come to non-Jews through Christ . He did it so that we might receive the promise of the Holy Spirit by believing in Christ .
48003015	Brothers and sisters , let me give you an example from everyday life . No one can get rid of an official agreement between people . No one can add to it . It can't be changed after it has been made . It is the same with God's covenant .
48003016	The promises were given to Abraham . They were also given to his seed . Scripture does not say , " and to seeds . " That means many people . It says , " and to your seed . " That means one person . And that one person is Christ .
48003017	Here is what I mean . The law came 430 years after the promise . But the law does not get rid of God's covenant and promise . The covenant had already been made by God . So the law does not do away with the promise .
48003018	The great gift that God has for us does not depend on the law . If it did , it would no longer depend on a promise . But God gave it to Abraham as a free gift through a promise .
48003019	Then what was the purpose of the law ? It was added because of human sin . And it was supposed to control us until the promised Seed had come . The law was put into effect through angels by a go-between .
48003020	A go-between does not take sides . God didn't use a go-between when he made his promise to Abraham . But the same God was at work in both the law and the promise .
48003021	So is the law opposed to God's promises ? Certainly not ! What if a law had been given that could give life ? Then people could become right with God by obeying the law .
48003022	But Scripture announces that the whole world is a prisoner because of sin . It does so in order that what was promised might be given to those who believe . The promise comes through faith in Jesus Christ .
48003023	Before faith in Christ came , we were held prisoners by the law . We were locked up until faith was made known .
48003024	So the law was put in charge until Christ came . He came so that we might be made right with God by believing in Christ .
48003025	But now faith in Christ has come . So we are no longer under the control of the law .
48003026	You are all children of God by believing in Christ Jesus .
48003027	All of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ as if he were your clothes .
48003028	There is no Jew or Greek . There is no slave or free person . There is no male or female . Because you belong to Christ Jesus , you are all one .
48003029	You who belong to Christ are Abraham's seed . You will receive what God has promised .
48004001	Here is what I have been saying . As long as your own children are young , they are no different from slaves in your house . They are no different , even though they own all of the property .
48004002	They are under the care of guardians and those who manage the property . They are under their care until the time when their fathers give them the property .
48004003	It is the same with us . When we were children , we were slaves to the basic things the people of the world believe .
48004004	But then the right time came . God sent his Son . A woman gave birth to him . He was born under the authority of the law .
48004005	He came to set free those who were under the law . He wanted us to be adopted as children with all the rights children have .
48004006	Because you are his children , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts . He is the Holy Spirit . By his power we call God " [ Abba . ] " Abba means Father .
48004007	So you aren't slaves any longer . You are God's children . Because you are his children , he gives you what he promised to give his people .
48004008	At one time you didn't know God . You were slaves to gods that are really not gods at all .
48004009	But now you know God . Even better , God knows you . So why are you turning back to those weak and worthless beliefs ? Do you want to be slaves to them all over again ?
48004010	You are observing special days and months and seasons and years !
48004011	I am afraid for you . I am afraid that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you .
48004012	I make my appeal to you , brothers and sisters . I'm asking you to become like me . After all , I became like you . You didn't do anything wrong to me .
48004013	As you know , it was because I was sick that I first preached the good news to you .
48004014	My sickness was hard on you . But you didn't put me off . You didn't make fun of me . Instead , you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God . You welcomed me as if I were Christ Jesus himself .
48004015	What has happened to all of your joy ? If you could have torn out your own eyes and given them to me , you would have . I can give witness to that .
48004016	Have I become your enemy now by telling you the truth ?
48004017	Those people are trying hard to win you over . But it is not for your good . They want to take you away from us . They want you to commit yourselves to them .
48004018	It is fine to be committed to something , if the purpose is good . And you shouldn't be committed only when I am with you . You should always be committed .
48004019	My dear children , I am in pain for you . Once again I have pain like a woman giving birth . And my pain will continue until Christ makes you like himself .
48004020	I wish I could be with you now . I wish I could change my tone of voice . As it is , you bewilder me .
48004021	You who want to be under the authority of the law , tell me something . Don't you know what the law says ?
48004022	It is written that Abraham had two sons . The slave woman gave birth to one of them . The free woman gave birth to the other one .
48004023	Abraham's son by the slave woman was born in the usual way . But his son by the free woman was born because of God's promise .
48004024	Those things can be taken as examples . The two women stand for two covenants . One covenant comes from Mount Sinai . It gives birth to children who are going to be slaves . It is Hagar .
48004025	Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia . She stands for the present city of Jerusalem . That's because she and her children are slaves .
48004026	But the Jerusalem that is above is free . She is our mother .
48004027	It is written , " Be glad , woman , you who have no children . Start shouting , you who have no labor pains . The woman who is all alone has more children than the woman who has a husband . "
48004028	Brothers and sisters , you are children because of God's promise just as Isaac was .
48004029	At that time , the son born in the usual way tried to hurt the son born by the power of the Holy Spirit . It is the same now .
48004030	But what does Scripture say ? " Get rid of the slave woman . Get rid of her son . The slave woman's son will never have a share of the family's property with the free woman's son . "
48004031	Brothers and sisters , we are not the slave woman's children . We are the free woman's children .
48005001	Christ has set us free . He wants us to enjoy freedom . So stand firm . Don't let the chains of slavery hold you again .
48005002	Here is what I , Paul , say to you . Don't let yourselves be circumcised . If you do , Christ won't be of any value to you .
48005003	I say it again . Every man who lets himself be circumcised must obey the whole law .
48005004	Some of you are trying to be made right with God by obeying the law . You have been separated from Christ . You have fallen away from God's grace .
48005005	But we expect to be made completely holy because of our faith in Christ . Through the Holy Spirit we wait in hope .
48005006	Circumcision and uncircumcision aren't worth anything to those who believe in Christ Jesus . The only thing that really counts is faith that shows itself through love .
48005007	You were running a good race . Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	The One who chooses you does not keep you from obeying the truth .
48005009	You should know that " just a little yeast works its way through the whole batch of dough . "
48005010	The Lord makes me certain that you will not think in any other way . The one who has gotten you all mixed up will pay the price . It doesn't matter who that may be .
48005011	Brothers and sisters , I am not still preaching that people must be circumcised . If I were , why am I still being opposed ? If that were what I preach , then the cross wouldn't upset anyone .
48005012	So then , what about troublemakers who try to get others to be circumcised ? I wish they would go the whole way ! I wish they would cut off everything that marks them as men !
48005013	My brothers and sisters , you were chosen to be free . But don't use your freedom as an excuse to live in sin . Instead , serve one another in love .
48005014	The whole law can be found in a single command . " Love your neighbor as you love yourself . "
48005015	You must not keep on biting each other . You must not keep eating each other up . Watch out ! You might destroy each other .
48005016	So I say , live by the Holy Spirit's power . Then you will not do what your sinful nature wants you to do .
48005017	The sinful nature does not want what the Spirit delights in . And the Spirit does not want what the sinful nature delights in . The two are at war with each other . That's what makes you do what you don't want to do .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the authority of the law .
48005019	What the sinful nature does is clear . It enjoys sexual sins , impure acts and wild living .
48005020	It worships statues of gods . It also worships evil powers . It is full of hatred and fighting . It is full of jealousy and fits of anger . It is interested only in getting ahead . It stirs up trouble . It separates people into their own little groups .
48005021	It wants what others have . It gets drunk and takes part in wild parties . It does many things of that kind . I warn you now as I did before . People who live like that will not receive God's kingdom .
48005022	But the fruit the Holy Spirit produces is love , joy and peace . It is being patient , kind and good . It is being faithful
48005023	and gentle and having control of oneself . There is no law against things of that kind .
48005024	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed their sinful nature to his cross . They don't want what their sinful nature loves and longs for .
48005025	Since we live by the Spirit , let us march in step with the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become proud . Let us not make each other angry . Let us not want what belongs to others .
48006001	Brothers and sisters , what if someone is caught in a sin ? Then you who are guided by the Spirit should correct that person . Do it in a gentle way . But be careful . You could be tempted too .
48006002	Carry each other's heavy loads . If you do , you will give the law of Christ its full meaning .
48006003	If you think you are somebody when you are nobody , you are fooling yourselves .
48006004	Each of you should put your own actions to the test . Then you can take pride in yourself . You won't be comparing yourself to somebody else .
48006005	Each of you should carry your own load .
48006006	Those who are taught the word must share all good things with their teacher .
48006007	Don't be fooled . You can't outsmart God . A man gathers a crop from what he plants .
48006008	Some people plant to please their sinful nature . From that nature they will harvest death . Others plant to please the Holy Spirit . From the Spirit they will harvest eternal life .
48006009	Let us not become tired of doing good . At the right time we will gather a crop if we don't give up .
48006010	So when we can do good to everyone , let us do it . Let us make a special point of doing good to those who belong to the family of believers .
48006011	Look at the big letters I'm using as I write to you with my own hand !
48006012	Some people want others to think well of them . They are trying to force you to be circumcised . They do it for only one reason . They don't want to suffer by being connected with the cross of Christ .
48006013	Even those who are circumcised don't obey the law . But they want you to be circumcised . Then they can brag about what has been done to your body .
48006014	I never want to brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . Through that cross the ways of the world have been crucified as far as I am concerned . And I have been crucified as far as the ways of the world are concerned .
48006015	Circumcision and uncircumcision don't mean anything . What really counts is the creation of a new nature .
48006016	May peace and mercy be given to all who follow this rule . May peace and mercy be given to the Israel that belongs to God .
48006017	Finally , let no one cause trouble for me . My body has marks that show I belong to Jesus .
48006018	Brothers and sisters , may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
49001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . I am sending this letter to you , God's people in Ephesus . Because you belong to Christ Jesus , you are faithful .
49001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
49001003	Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing . Those blessings come from the heavenly world . They belong to us because we belong to Christ .
49001004	God chose us to belong to Christ before the world was created . He chose us to be holy and without blame in his eyes . He loved us .
49001005	So he decided long ago to adopt us as his children . He did it because of what Jesus Christ has done . It pleased God to do it .
49001006	All those things bring praise to his glorious grace . God freely gave us his grace because of the One he loves .
49001007	We have been set free because of what Christ has done . Through his blood our sins have been forgiven . We have been set free because God's grace is so rich .
49001008	He poured his grace on us by giving us great wisdom and understanding .
49001009	He showed us the mystery of his plan . It was in keeping with what he wanted to do . It was what he had planned through Christ .
49001010	It will all come about when history has been completed . God will then bring together all things in heaven and on earth under one ruler . The ruler is Christ .
49001011	We were also chosen to belong to him . God decided to choose us long ago in keeping with his plan . He works out everything to fit his plan and purpose .
49001012	We were the first to put our hope in Christ . We were chosen to bring praise to his glory .
49001013	You also became believers in Christ . That happened when you heard the message of truth . It was the good news about how you could be saved . When you believed , he marked you with a seal . The seal is the Holy Spirit that he promised .
49001014	The Spirit marks us as God's own . We can now be sure that someday we will receive all that God has promised . That will happen after God sets all of his people completely free . All of those things will bring praise to his glory .
49001015	I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus . I have also heard about your love for all of God's people . That is why
49001016	I have not stopped thanking God for you . I always remember you in my prayers .
49001017	I pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ . God is the glorious Father . I keep asking him to give you the wisdom and understanding that come from the Holy Spirit . I want you to know God better .
49001018	I also pray that your mind might see more clearly . Then you will know the hope God has chosen you to receive . You will know that the things God's people will receive are rich and glorious .
49001019	And you will know his great power . It can't be compared with anything else . It is at work for us who believe . It is like the mighty strength
49001020	God showed when he raised Christ from the dead . He seated him at his right hand in his heavenly kingdom .
49001021	There Christ sits far above all who rule and have authority . He also sits far above all powers and kings . He is above every title that can be given in this world and in the world to come .
49001022	God placed all things under Christ's rule . He appointed him to be ruler over everything for the church .
49001023	The church is Christ's body . It is filled by Christ . He fills everything in every way .
49002001	You were living in your sins and lawless ways . But in fact you were dead .
49002002	You used to live as sinners when you followed the ways of this world . You served the one who rules over the spiritual forces of evil . He is the spirit who is now at work in those who don't obey God .
49002003	At one time we all lived among them . We tried to satisfy what our sinful nature wanted to do . We followed its longings and thoughts . God was angry with us and everyone else because of the kind of people we were .
49002004	But God loves us deeply . He is full of mercy .
49002005	So he gave us new life because of what Christ has done . He gave us life even when we were dead in sin . God's grace has saved you .
49002006	God raised us up with Christ . He has seated us with him in his heavenly kingdom because we belong to Christ Jesus .
49002007	He has done it to show the riches of his grace for all time to come . His grace can't be compared with anything else . He has shown it by being kind to us because of what Christ Jesus has done .
49002008	God's grace has saved you because of your faith in Christ . Your salvation doesn't come from anything you do . It is God's gift .
49002009	It is not based on anything you have done . No one can brag about earning it .
49002010	God made us . He created us to belong to Christ Jesus . Now we can do good things . Long ago God prepared them for us to do .
49002011	You who are not Jews by birth , here is what I want you to remember . You are called " uncircumcised " by those who call themselves " circumcised . " But they have only been circumcised in their bodies by human hands .
49002012	Before you believed in Christ , you were separated from him . You were not considered to be citizens of Israel . You were not included in what the covenants promised . You were without hope and without God in the world .
49002013	At one time you were far away from God . But now you belong to Christ Jesus . He spilled his blood for you . That has brought you near to God .
49002014	Christ himself is our peace . He has made Jews and non-Jews into one group of people . He has destroyed the hatred that was like a wall between us .
49002015	Through his body on the cross , Christ put an end to the law with all its commands and rules . He wanted to create one new group of people out of the two . He wanted to make peace between them .
49002016	He planned to bring both of them as one body back to God because of the cross . Christ put their hatred to death on that cross .
49002017	He came and preached peace to you who were far away . He also preached peace to those who were near .
49002018	Through Christ we both come to the Father by the power of one Holy Spirit .
49002019	So you are no longer strangers and outsiders . You are citizens together with God's people . You are members of God's family .
49002020	You are a building that is built on the apostles and prophets . They are the foundation . Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone in the building .
49002021	The whole building is held together by him . It rises to become a holy temple because it belongs to the Lord .
49002022	And because you belong to him , you too are being built together . You are being made into a house where God lives through his Spirit .
49003001	I , Paul , am a prisoner because of Christ Jesus . I am in prison because of my work among you who are not Jews .
49003002	I am sure you have heard that God appointed me to share his grace with you .
49003003	I'm talking about the mystery God showed me . I have already written a little about it .
49003004	By reading it you will be able to understand what I know about the mystery of Christ .
49003005	The mystery was not made known to people of other times . But now the Holy Spirit has made it known to God's holy apostles and prophets .
49003006	Here is the mystery . Because of the good news , God's promises are for non-Jews as well as for Jews . Both groups are parts of one body . They share in the promise . It belongs to them because they belong to Christ Jesus .
49003007	I now serve the good news because God gave me his grace . His power is at work in me .
49003008	I am by far the least important of all of God's people . But he gave me the grace to preach to the non-Jews about the wonderful riches that Christ gives .
49003009	God told me to make clear to everyone how the mystery came about . In times past it was kept hidden in the mind of God , who created all things .
49003010	He wanted the rulers and authorities in the heavenly world to come to know his great wisdom . The church would make it known to them .
49003011	That was God's plan from the beginning . He has worked it out through Christ Jesus our Lord .
49003012	Through him and through faith in him we can approach God . We can come to him freely . We can come without fear .
49003013	So here is what I'm asking you to do . Don't lose hope because I am suffering for you . It will lead to the time when God will give you his glory .
49003014	I bow in prayer to the Father because of my work among you .
49003015	From the Father his whole family in heaven and on earth gets its name .
49003016	I pray that he will use his glorious riches to make you strong . May his Holy Spirit give you his power deep down inside you .
49003017	Then Christ will live in your hearts because you believe in him . And I pray that your love will have deep roots . I pray that it will have a strong foundation .
49003018	May you have power with all God's people to understand Christ's love . May you know how wide and long and high and deep it is .
49003019	And may you know his love , even though it can't be known completely . Then you will be filled with everything God has for you .
49003020	God is able to do far more than we could ever ask for or imagine . He does everything by his power that is working in us .
49003021	Give him glory in the church and in Christ Jesus . Give him glory through all time and for ever and ever . Amen .
49004001	I am a prisoner because of the Lord . So I am asking you to live a life worthy of what God chose you for .
49004002	Don't be proud at all . Be completely gentle . Be patient . Put up with one another in love .
49004003	The Holy Spirit makes you one in every way . So try your best to remain as one . Let peace keep you together .
49004004	There is one body . There is one Spirit . You were appointed to one hope when you were chosen .
49004005	There is one Lord . There is one faith and one baptism .
49004006	There is one God and Father of all . He is over everything . He is through everything . He is in everything .
49004007	But each one of us has received a gift of grace , just as Christ wanted us to have it .
49004008	That is why Scripture says , " When he went up to his place on high , he led a line of prisoners . He gave gifts to people . "
49004009	What does " he went up " mean ? It can only mean that he also came down to the lower , earthly places .
49004010	The One who came down is the same as the One who went up higher than all the heavens . He did it in order to fill all of creation .
49004011	He is the One who gave some the gift to be apostles . He gave some the gift to be prophets . He gave some the gift of preaching the good news . And he gave some the gift to be pastors and teachers .
49004012	He did it so that they might prepare God's people to serve . If they do , the body of Christ will be built up .
49004013	That will continue until we all become one in the faith and in the knowledge of God's Son . Then we will be grown up in the faith . We will receive everything that Christ has for us .
49004014	We will no longer be babies in the faith . We won't be like ships tossed around by the waves . We won't be blown here and there by every new teaching . We won't be blown around by the cleverness and tricks of people who try to hide their evil plans .
49004015	Instead , we will speak the truth in love . We will grow up into Christ in every way . He is the Head .
49004016	He makes the whole body grow and build itself up in love . Under the control of Christ , each part of the body does its work . It supports the other parts . In that way , the body is joined and held together .
49004017	Here is what I'm telling you . I am speaking for the Lord as I warn you . You must no longer live like those who aren't Jews . Their thoughts don't have any purpose .
49004018	They can't understand the truth . They are separated from the life of God . That is because they don't know him . And they don't know him because their hearts are stubborn .
49004019	They have lost all feeling for what is right . They have given themselves over to the evil pleasures of their bodies . They take part in every kind of unclean act . And they always long for more .
49004020	But that is not what you have learned about Christ .
49004021	I'm sure you heard of him . I'm sure you were taught by him . What you learned was the truth about Jesus .
49004022	You were taught not to live the way you used to . You must get rid of your old way of life . That's because it is polluted by longing for things that lead you down the wrong path .
49004023	You were taught to be made new in your thinking .
49004024	You were taught to start living a new life . It is created to be truly good and holy , just as God is .
49004025	So each of you must get rid of your lying . Speak the truth to your neighbor . We are all parts of one body .
49004026	Scripture says , " When you are angry , do not sin . " Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry .
49004027	Don't give the devil a chance .
49004028	Those who have been stealing must never steal again . Instead , they must work . They must do something useful with their own hands . Then they will have something to give to people in need .
49004029	Don't let any evil talk come out of your mouths . Say only what will help to build others up and meet their needs . Then what you say will help those who listen .
49004030	Do not make God's Holy Spirit sad . He marked you with a seal for the day when God will set you completely free .
49004031	Get rid of all hard feelings , anger and rage . Stop all fighting and lying . Put away every form of hatred .
49004032	Be kind and tender to one another . Forgive each other , just as God forgave you because of what Christ has done .
49005001	You are the children that God dearly loves . So be just like him .
49005002	Lead a life of love , just as Christ did . He loved us . He gave himself up for us . He was a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God .
49005003	There should not be even a hint of sexual sin among you . Don't do anything unclean . And do not always want more and more . Things like that are not what God's holy people should do .
49005004	There must not be any unclean speech or foolish talk or dirty jokes . All of them are out of place . Instead , you should give thanks .
49005005	Here is what you can be sure of . Those who give themselves over to sexual sins are lost . So are people whose lives are not pure . The same is true of those who always want more and more . People who do those things might as well worship statues of gods . No one who does them will receive a share in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
49005006	Don't let anyone fool you with words that don't mean anything . Because of things like that , God is angry with those who don't obey .
49005007	So don't go along with people like that .
49005008	At one time you were in the dark . But now you are in the light because of what the Lord has done . Live like children of the light .
49005009	The light produces what is completely good , right and true .
49005010	Find out what pleases the Lord .
49005011	Have nothing to do with the acts of darkness . They don't produce anything good . Show what they are really like .
49005012	It is shameful even to talk about what people who don't obey do in secret .
49005013	But everything the light shines on can be seen .
49005014	Light makes everything clear . That is why it is said , " Wake up , sleeper . Rise from the dead . Then Christ will shine on you . "
49005015	So be very careful how you live . Do not live like people who aren't wise . Live like people who are wise .
49005016	Make the most of every opportunity . The days are evil .
49005017	So don't be foolish . Instead , understand what the Lord wants .
49005018	Don't fill yourself up with wine . Getting drunk will lead to wild living . Instead , be filled with the Holy Spirit .
49005019	Speak to each other with psalms , hymns and spiritual songs . Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord .
49005020	Always give thanks to God the Father for everything . Give thanks to him in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49005021	Follow the lead of one another because of your respect for Christ .
49005022	Wives , follow the lead of your husbands as you follow the Lord .
49005023	The husband is the head of the wife , just as Christ is the head of the church . The church is Christ's body . He is its Savior .
49005024	The church follows the lead of Christ . In the same way , wives should follow the lead of their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives . Love them just as Christ loved the church . He gave himself up for her .
49005026	He did it to make her holy . He made her clean by washing her with water and the word .
49005027	He did it to bring her to himself as a brightly shining church . He wants a church that has no stain or wrinkle or any other flaw . He wants a church that is holy and without blame .
49005028	In the same way , husbands should love their wives . They should love them as they love their own bodies . Any man who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	After all , people have never hated their own bodies . Instead , they feed and care for their bodies . And that is what Christ does for the church .
49005030	We are parts of his body .
49005031	Scripture says , " That's why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife . The two will become one . "
49005032	That is a deep mystery . But I'm talking about Christ and the church .
49005033	A husband also must love his wife . He must love her just as he loves himself . And a wife must respect her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents as believers in the Lord . Obey them because it's the right thing to do .
49006002	Scripture says , " Honor your father and mother . " That is the first commandment that has a promise .
49006003	" Then things will go well with you . You will live a long time on the earth . "
49006004	Fathers , don't make your children angry . Instead , train them and teach them the ways of the Lord as you raise them .
49006005	Slaves , obey your masters here on earth . Respect them and honor them with a heart that is true . Obey them just as you would obey Christ .
49006006	Don't obey them only to please them when they are watching . Do it because you are slaves of Christ . Be sure your heart does what God wants .
49006007	Serve your masters with all your heart . Work as if you were not serving people but the Lord .
49006008	You know that the Lord will give you a reward . He will give to each of you in keeping with the good you do . It doesn't matter whether you are slaves or free .
49006009	Masters , treat your slaves in the same way . When you warn them , don't be too hard on them . You know that the One who is their Master and yours is in heaven . And he treats everyone the same .
49006010	Finally , let the Lord make you strong . Depend on his mighty power .
49006011	Put on all of God's armor . Then you can stand firm against the devil's evil plans .
49006012	Our fight is not against human beings . It is against the rulers , the authorities and the powers of this dark world . It is against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly world .
49006013	So put on all of God's armor . Evil days will come . But you will be able to stand up to anything . And after you have done everything you can , you will still be standing .
49006014	So stand firm . Put the belt of truth around your waist . Put the armor of godliness on your chest .
49006015	Wear on your feet what will prepare you to tell the good news of peace .
49006016	Also , pick up the shield of faith . With it you can put out all of the flaming arrows of the evil one .
49006017	Put on the helmet of salvation . And take the sword of the Holy Spirit . The sword is God's word .
49006018	At all times , pray by the power of the Spirit . Pray all kinds of prayers . Be watchful , so that you can pray . Always keep on praying for all of God's people .
49006019	Pray also for me . Pray that when I open my mouth , the right words will be given to me . Then I can be bold as I tell the mystery of the good news .
49006020	Because of the good news , I am being held by chains as the Lord's messenger . So pray that I will be bold as I preach the good news . That's what I should do .
49006021	Tychicus is a dear brother . He is faithful in serving the Lord . He will tell you everything about me . Then you will know how I am and what I am doing .
49006022	That's why I am sending him to you . I want you to know how we are . And I want him to cheer you up .
49006023	May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give peace to the brothers and sisters . May they also give them love and faith .
49006024	May grace be given to everyone who loves our Lord Jesus Christ with a love that will never die .
50001001	We , Paul and Timothy , are writing this letter . We serve Christ Jesus . We are sending this letter to you , all of God's people in Philippi . You belong to Christ Jesus . We are also sending this letter to your leaders and deacons .
50001002	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
50001003	I thank my God every time I remember you .
50001004	In all my prayers for all of you , I always pray with joy .
50001005	I am happy because you have joined me in spreading the good news . You have done so from the first day until now .
50001006	I am sure that the One who began a good work in you will carry it on until it is completed . That will be on the day Christ Jesus returns .
50001007	It is right for me to feel this way about all of you . I love you with all my heart . I may be held by chains , or I may be standing up for the truth of the good news . Either way , all of you share in God's grace together with me .
50001008	God can give witness that I long for all of you . I love you with the love that Christ Jesus gives .
50001009	I pray that your love will grow more and more . And let it be based on knowledge and understanding .
50001010	Then you will be able to know what is best . You will be pure and without blame until the day Christ returns .
50001011	You will be filled with the fruit of right living produced by Jesus Christ . All of those things bring glory and praise to God .
50001012	Brothers and sisters , here is what I want you to know . What has happened to me has really helped to spread the good news .
50001013	One thing has become clear . I am being held by chains because of my stand for Christ . All of the palace guards and everyone else know it .
50001014	Because I am being held by chains , most of the believers in the Lord have become bolder . They now speak God's word more boldly and without fear .
50001015	It's true that some preach about Christ because they are jealous . But others preach about Christ to help me in my work .
50001016	The last group acts out of love . They know I have been put here to stand up for the good news .
50001017	But the others preach about Christ only to get ahead . They are not honest and true . They think they can stir up trouble for me while I am being held by chains .
50001018	But what does it matter ? Here is the important thing . Whether for reasons that are right or wrong , Christ is being preached about . That makes me very glad . And I will continue to be glad .
50001019	I know that you are praying for me . I also know that the Spirit of Jesus Christ will help me . So no matter what happens , I'm sure I will still be saved .
50001020	I completely expect and hope that I won't be ashamed in any way . I'm sure I will be brave enough . Now as always Christ will be lifted high through my body . He will be lifted up whether I live or die .
50001021	For me , life finds all of its meaning in Christ . Death also has its benefits .
50001022	Suppose I go on living in my body . Then I will be able to carry on my work . It will bear a lot of fruit . But what should I choose ? I don't know .
50001023	I can't decide between the two . I long to leave this world and be with Christ . That is better by far .
50001024	But it is more important for you that I stay alive .
50001025	I'm sure of that . So I know I will remain with you . And I will continue with all of you to help you grow and be joyful in what you have been taught .
50001026	I'm sure I will be with you again . Then your joy in Christ Jesus will be greater than ever because of me .
50001027	No matter what happens , live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ . Then I will know that you stand firm with one purpose . I may come and see you or only hear about you . But I will know that you work together as one person . And I will know that you work to spread the teachings of the good news .
50001028	So don't be afraid in any way of those who oppose you . That will show them that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved . That's what God will do .
50001029	Here is what he has given you to do for Christ . You must not only believe in him . You must also suffer for him .
50001030	You are going through the same struggle you saw me go through . As you have heard , I am still struggling .
50002001	Are you cheerful because you belong to Christ ? Does his love comfort you ? Is the Holy Spirit your companion ? Has Christ been gentle and loving toward you ?
50002002	Then make my joy complete by agreeing with each other . Have the same love . Be one in spirit and purpose .
50002003	Don't do anything only to get ahead . Don't do it because you are proud . Instead , be free of pride . Think of others as better than yourselves .
50002004	None of you should look out just for your own good . You should also look out for the good of others .
50002005	You should think in the same way Christ Jesus does .
50002006	In his very nature he was God . But he did not think that being equal with God was something he should hold on to .
50002007	Instead , he made himself nothing . He took on the very nature of a servant . He was made in human form .
50002008	He appeared as a man . He came down to the lowest level . He obeyed God completely , even though it led to his death . In fact , he died on a cross .
50002009	So God lifted him up to the highest place . He gave him the name that is above every name .
50002010	When the name of Jesus is spoken , everyone's knee will bow to worship him . Every knee in heaven and on earth and under the earth will bow to worship him .
50002011	Everyone's mouth will say that Jesus Christ is Lord . And God the Father will receive the glory .
50002012	My dear friends , you have always obeyed God . You obeyed while I was with you . And you have obeyed even more while I am not with you . So continue to work out your own salvation . Do it with fear and trembling .
50002013	God is working in you . He wants your plans and your acts to be in keeping with his good purpose .
50002014	Do everything without finding fault or arguing .
50002015	Then you will be pure and without blame . You will be children of God without fault in a sinful and evil world . Among the people of the world you shine like stars in the heavens .
50002016	You shine as you hold out to them the word of life . So I can brag about you on the day Christ returns . I can be happy that I didn't run or work for nothing .
50002017	But my life might even be poured out like a drink offering on your sacrifices . I'm talking about the way you serve because you believe . Even so , I am glad . I am joyful with all of you .
50002018	So you too should be glad and joyful with me .
50002019	I hope to send Timothy to you soon if the Lord Jesus allows it . Then I will be cheered up when I receive news about you .
50002020	I have no one else like Timothy . He truly cares about how you are doing .
50002021	All the others are looking out for their own interests . They are not looking out for the interests of Jesus Christ .
50002022	But you know that Timothy has proved himself . He has served with me like a son with his father in spreading the good news .
50002023	So I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me .
50002024	And I'm sure I myself will come soon if the Lord allows it .
50002025	But I think it's necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you . He is my brother in the Lord . He is a worker and a soldier of Christ together with me . He is also your messenger . You sent him to take care of my needs .
50002026	He longs for all of you . He is troubled because you heard he was sick .
50002027	He was very sick . In fact , he almost died . But God had mercy on him . He also had mercy on me . God spared me sadness after sadness .
50002028	So I want even more to send him to you . Then when you see him again , you will be glad . And I won't worry so much .
50002029	Welcome him as a brother in the Lord with great joy . Honor people like him .
50002030	He almost died for the work of Christ . He put his life in danger to make up for the help you couldn't give me .
50003001	Finally , my brothers and sisters , be joyful because you belong to the Lord . It is no trouble for me to write about some important matters to you again . If you know about them , you will have a safe path to follow .
50003002	Watch out for those dogs . They do evil things . When they circumcise , it is nothing more than a useless cutting of the body .
50003003	But we have been truly circumcised . We worship God by the power of his Spirit . We brag about what Christ Jesus has done . We don't put our trust in our weak human nature .
50003004	I have many reasons to trust in my human nature . Others may think they have reasons to trust in theirs . But I have even more .
50003005	I was circumcised on the eighth day . I am part of the people of Israel . I am from the tribe of Benjamin . I am a pure Hebrew . As far as the law is concerned , I am a Pharisee .
50003006	As far as being committed is concerned , I opposed and attacked the church . As far as keeping the Law is concerned , I kept it perfectly .
50003007	I thought things like that were for my benefit . But now I consider them to be nothing because of Christ .
50003008	Even more , I consider everything to be nothing compared to knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . To know him is the best thing of all . Because of him I have lost everything . But I consider all of it to be garbage so I can get to know Christ .
50003009	I want to be joined to him . For me , being right with God does not come from the law . It comes because I believe in Christ . It comes from God . It is received by faith .
50003010	I want to know Christ better . I want to know the power that raised him from the dead . I want to share in his sufferings . I want to become like him by sharing in his death .
50003011	Then by God's grace I will rise from the dead .
50003012	I have not yet received all of those things . I have not yet been made perfect . But I move on to take hold of what Christ Jesus took hold of me for .
50003013	Brothers and sisters , I don't consider that I have taken hold of it yet . But here is the one thing I do . I forget what is behind me . I push hard toward what is ahead of me .
50003014	I move on toward the goal to win the prize . God has appointed me to win it . The heavenly prize is Christ Jesus himself .
50003015	All of us who are grown up in the faith should see things that way . Maybe you think differently about something . But God will make it clear to you .
50003016	Only let us live up to what we have already reached .
50003017	Brothers and sisters , join with others in following my example . Pay close attention to those who live in keeping with the pattern we gave you .
50003018	I have told you those things many times before . Now I say it again with tears in my eyes . Many people live like enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	The only thing they have coming to them is death . Their stomach is their god . They brag about what they should be ashamed of . They think only about earthly things .
50003020	But we are citizens of heaven . And we can hardly wait for a Savior from there . He is the Lord Jesus Christ .
50003021	He has the power to bring everything under his control . By his power he will change our earthly bodies . They will become like his glorious body .
50004001	My brothers and sisters , that is how you should stand firm in the Lord's strength . I love you and long for you . Dear friends , you are my joy and my crown .
50004002	Here is what I'm asking Euodia and Syntyche to do . I want them to agree with each other because they belong to the Lord .
50004003	My true companion , here is what I ask you to do . Help those women . They have served at my side . They have helped me spread the good news . So have Clement and the rest of those who have worked together with me . Their names are all written in the Book of Life .
50004004	Always be joyful because you belong to the Lord . I will say it again . Be joyful .
50004005	Let everyone know how gentle you are . The Lord is coming soon .
50004006	Don't worry about anything . Instead , tell God about everything . Ask and pray . Give thanks to him .
50004007	Then God's peace will watch over your hearts and your minds because you belong to Christ Jesus . God's peace can never be completely understood .
50004008	Finally , my brothers and sisters , always think about what is true . Think about what is noble , right and pure . Think about what is lovely and worthy of respect . If anything is excellent or worthy of praise , think about those kinds of things .
50004009	Do what you have learned or received or heard from me . Follow my example . The God who gives peace will be with you .
50004010	At last you are concerned about me again . That makes me very happy . We belong to the Lord . I know that you have been concerned . But you had no chance to show it .
50004011	I'm not saying that because I need anything . I have learned to be content no matter what happens to me .
50004012	I know what it's like not to have what I need . I also know what it's like to have more than I need . I have learned the secret of being content no matter what happens . I am content whether I am well fed or hungry . I am content whether I have more than enough or not enough .
50004013	I can do everything by the power of Christ . He gives me strength .
50004014	But it was good of you to share in my troubles .
50004015	And you believers at Philippi know what happened when I left Macedonia . Not one church helped me in the matter of giving and receiving . You were the only one that did . That was in the early days when you first heard the good news .
50004016	Even when I was in Thessalonica , you sent me help when I needed it . You did it again and again .
50004017	I'm not looking for a gift . I'm looking for what is best for you .
50004018	I have received my full pay , and even more than that . I have everything I need . That's because Epaphroditus brought me the gifts you sent . They are a sweet-smelling offering . They are a gift that God accepts . He is pleased with it .
50004019	My God will meet all your needs . He will meet them in keeping with his wonderful riches that come to you because you belong to Christ Jesus .
50004020	Give glory to our God and Father for ever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Greet all of God's people . They belong to Christ Jesus . The brothers who are with me send greetings .
50004022	All of God's people here send you greetings . Most of all , those who live in the palace of Caesar send you greetings .
50004023	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
51001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . Our brother Timothy joins me in writing .
51001002	We are sending this letter to you , our brothers and sisters in Colosse . You belong to Christ . You are holy and faithful . May God our Father give you grace and peace .
51001003	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you .
51001004	We thank him because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus . We have also heard that you love all of God's people .
51001005	Your faith and love are based on the hope you have . What you hope for is stored up for you in heaven . You have already heard about it . You were told about it when the message of truth was given to you . I'm talking about the good news
51001006	that has come to you . All over the world the good news is bearing fruit and growing . It has been doing that among you since the day you heard it . That is when you understood God's grace in all its truth .
51001007	You learned the good news from Epaphras . He is dear to us . He serves Christ together with us . He faithfully works for Christ and for us among you .
51001008	He also told us about your love that comes from the Holy Spirit .
51001009	That's why we have not stopped praying for you . We have been praying for you since the day we heard about you . We have been asking God to fill you with the knowledge of what he wants . We pray that he will give you spiritual wisdom and understanding .
51001010	We pray that you will lead a life that is worthy of the Lord . We pray that you will please him in every way . So we want you to bear fruit in every good thing you do . We want you to grow to know God better .
51001011	We want you to be very strong , in keeping with his glorious power . We want you to be patient . Never give up . Be joyful
51001012	as you give thanks to the Father . He has made you fit to share with all his people . You will all receive a share in the kingdom of light .
51001013	He has saved us from the kingdom of darkness . He has brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves .
51001014	Because of what the Son has done , we have been set free . Because of him , all of our sins have been forgiven .
51001015	Christ is the exact likeness of God , who can't be seen . He is first , and he is over all of creation .
51001016	All things were created by him . He created everything in heaven and on earth . He created everything that can be seen and everything that can't be seen . He created kings , powers , rulers and authorities . Everything was created by him and for him .
51001017	Before anything was created , he was already there . He holds everything together .
51001018	And he is the head of the body , which is the church . He is the beginning . He is the first to be raised from the dead . That happened so that he would be far above everything .
51001019	God was pleased to have his whole nature living in Christ .
51001020	God was pleased to bring all things back to himself because of what Christ has done . That includes all things on earth and in heaven . God made peace through Christ's blood , through his death on the cross .
51001021	At one time you were separated from God . You were enemies in your minds because of your evil ways .
51001022	But because Christ died , God has brought you back to himself . Christ's death has made you holy in God's sight . So now you don't have any flaw . You are free from blame .
51001023	But you must keep your faith steady and firm . Don't move away from the hope that the good news holds out to you . It is the good news that you heard . It has been preached to every creature under heaven . I , Paul , now serve the good news .
51001024	I am happy because of what was suffered for you . And in my body I fill up my share in Christ's sufferings . I do it for his body , which is the church .
51001025	I serve the church . God appointed me to bring all of his word to you .
51001026	That word contains the mystery that has been hidden for many ages . But now it has been made known to God's people .
51001027	God has chosen to make known to them the glorious riches of that mystery . He has made it known among those who aren't Jews . And here is what it is . Christ is in you . He is your hope of glory .
51001028	We preach about him . With all the wisdom we have , we warn and teach everyone . When we bring them to God , we want them to be perfect as people who belong to Christ .
51001029	That's what I'm working for . I work hard with all of Christ's strength . His strength works powerfully in me .
51002001	I want you to know how hard I am working for you . I'm concerned for those who are in Laodicea . I'm also concerned for everyone who has not met me in person .
51002002	I want their hearts to be made cheerful and strong . I want them to be joined together in love . Then their understanding will be rich and complete . They will know the mystery of God . That mystery is Christ .
51002003	All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in him .
51002004	But I don't want anyone to fool you with fast talk that only sounds good .
51002005	So even though I am away from you in body , I am with you in spirit . I am glad to see that you are doing everything in good order . And I am happy that your faith in Christ is so strong .
51002006	You received Christ Jesus as Lord . So keep on living in him .
51002007	Have your roots in him . Build yourselves up in him . Grow strong in what you believe , just as you were taught . Be more thankful than ever before .
51002008	Make sure no one captures you . They will try to capture you by using false reasoning that has no meaning . Their ideas depend on human teachings . They also depend on the basic things the people of this world believe . They don't depend on Christ .
51002009	God's whole nature is living in Christ in human form .
51002010	Because you belong to Christ , you have everything you need . He is the ruler over every power and authority .
51002011	When you received Christ , you were also circumcised by putting away your sinful nature . Human hands didn't circumcise you . Christ did .
51002012	When you were baptized , you were buried together with him . You were raised to life together with him by believing in God's power . God raised Jesus from the dead .
51002013	At one time you were dead in your sins . Your sinful nature was not circumcised . But God gave you new life together with Christ . He forgave us all of our sins .
51002014	He wiped out the written Law with its rules . The Law was against us . It opposed us . He took it away and nailed it to the cross .
51002015	He took away the weapons of the powers and authorities . He made a public show of them . He won the battle over them by dying on the cross .
51002016	So don't let anyone judge you because of what you eat or drink . Don't let anyone judge you about holy days . I'm talking about special feasts and New Moons and Sabbath days .
51002017	They are only a shadow of the things that were going to come . But what is real is found in Christ .
51002018	Some people enjoy pretending they aren't proud . They worship angels . But don't let people like that hold you back from winning the prize . They tell you every little thing about what they have seen . Their minds are not guided by the Holy Spirit . So they are proud of their useless ideas .
51002019	They aren't connected to the Head . But the whole body grows from the Head . The muscles and tendons hold the body together . And God causes it to grow .
51002020	The people of the world believe certain basic things . You died with Christ as far as things like that are concerned . So why do you act as if you still belong to the world ? Here are the rules you follow .
51002021	" Do not handle ! Do not taste ! Do not touch ! "
51002022	Rules like that are all going to die out as time goes by . They are only based on human rules and teachings .
51002023	It is true that those rules seem wise . Because of them , people give themselves over to their own kind of worship . They pretend they aren't proud . They treat their bodies very badly . But rules like that don't help . They don't stop people from chasing after sinful pleasures .
51003001	You have been raised up with Christ . So think about things that are in heaven . That is where Christ is . He is sitting at God's right hand .
51003002	Think about things that are in heaven . Don't think about things that are on earth .
51003003	You died . Now your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	Christ is your life . When he appears again , you also will appear with him in heaven's glory .
51003005	So put to death anything that belongs to your earthly nature . Get rid of your sexual sins and unclean acts . Don't let your feelings get out of control . Remove from your life all evil longings . Stop always wanting more and more . You might as well be worshiping statues of gods .
51003006	God's anger is going to come because of those things .
51003007	That's the way you lived at one time in your life .
51003008	But now here are the kinds of things you must get rid of . You must put away anger , rage , hate and lies . Let no dirty words come out of your mouths .
51003009	Don't lie to each other . You have gotten rid of your old way of life and its habits .
51003010	You have started living a new life . It is being made new so that what you know has the Creator's likeness .
51003011	Here there is no Greek or Jew . There is no difference between those who are circumcised and those who are not . There is no rude outsider , or even a Scythian . There is no slave or free person . But Christ is everything . And he is in everything .
51003012	You are God's chosen people . You are holy and dearly loved . So put on tender mercy and kindness as if they were your clothes . Don't be proud . Be gentle and patient .
51003013	Put up with each other . Forgive the things you are holding against one another . Forgive , just as the Lord forgave you .
51003014	And over all of those good things put on love . Love holds them all together perfectly as if they were one .
51003015	Let the peace that Christ gives rule in your hearts . As parts of one body , you were appointed to live in peace . And be thankful .
51003016	Let Christ's word live in you like a rich treasure . Teach and correct each other wisely . Sing psalms , hymns and spiritual songs . Sing with thanks in your hearts to God .
51003017	Do everything you say or do in the name of the Lord Jesus . Always give thanks to God the Father through Christ .
51003018	Wives , follow the lead of your husbands . That's what the Lord wants you to do .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives . Don't be mean to them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything . That pleases the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , don't make your children bitter . If you do , they will lose hope .
51003022	Slaves , obey your earthly masters in everything . Don't do it just to please them when they are watching you . Obey them with an honest heart . Do it out of respect for the Lord .
51003023	Work at everything you do with all your heart . Work as if you were working for the Lord , not for human masters .
51003024	Work because you know that you will finally receive as a reward what the Lord wants you to have . You are serving the Lord Christ .
51003025	Anyone who does wrong will be paid back for what he does . God treats everyone the same .
51004001	Masters , give your slaves what is right and fair . Do it because you know that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Spend a lot of time in prayer . Always be watchful and thankful .
51004003	Pray for us too . Pray that God will open a door for our message . Then we can preach the mystery of Christ . Because I preached it , I am being held by chains .
51004004	Pray that I will preach it clearly , as I should .
51004005	Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders . Make the most of every opportunity .
51004006	Let the words you speak always be full of grace . Season them with salt . Then you will know how to answer everyone .
51004007	Tychicus will tell you all the news about me . He is a dear brother . He is a faithful worker . He serves the Lord together with us .
51004008	I am sending him to you for one reason . I want you to know what is happening here . I want him to cheer you up and make your hearts strong .
51004009	He is coming with Onesimus , our faithful and dear brother . He is one of you . They will tell you everything that is happening here .
51004010	Aristarchus is in prison with me . He sends you his greetings . So does Mark , the cousin of Barnabas . You have been given directions about him . If he comes to you , welcome him .
51004011	Jesus , who is called Justus , also sends greetings . They are the only Jews who work together with me for God's kingdom . They have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras sends greetings . He is one of you . He serves Christ Jesus . He is always praying hard for you . He prays that you will stand firm in holding to all that God has in mind for us . He prays that you will continue to grow in your knowledge of what God wants you to do . He also prays that you will be completely sure about it .
51004013	I am happy to tell you that he is working very hard for you . He is also working hard for everyone in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Our dear friend Luke , the doctor , sends greetings . So does Demas .
51004015	Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea . Also give my greetings to Nympha and the church that meets in her house .
51004016	After this letter has been read to you , send it on . Be sure that it is also read to the church in Laodicea . And be sure that you read the letter from Laodicea .
51004017	Tell Archippus , " Be sure that you complete the work the Lord gave you to do . "
51004018	I , Paul , am writing this greeting with my own hand . Remember that I am being held by chains . May grace be with you .
52001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . Silas and Timothy join me in writing . We are sending this letter to you , the members of the church in Thessalonica . You belong to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . May grace and peace be given to you .
52001002	We always thank God for all of you . We pray for you .
52001003	We never forget you when we pray to our God and Father . Your work is produced by your faith . Your service is the result of your love . Your strength to continue comes from your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
52001004	Brothers and sisters , you are loved by God . We know that he has chosen you .
52001005	Our good news didn't come to you only in words . It came with power . It came with the Holy Spirit's help . He gave us complete faith in what we were preaching . You know how we lived among you for your good .
52001006	We and the Lord were your examples . You followed us . You suffered terribly . Even so , you welcomed our message with the joy the Holy Spirit gives .
52001007	So you became a model to all the believers in the lands of Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	The Lord's message rang out from you . That was true not only in Macedonia and Achaia . Your faith in God has also become known everywhere . So we don't have to say anything about it .
52001009	The believers themselves report the kind of welcome you gave us . They tell about how you turned away from statues of gods to serve the living and true God .
52001010	They tell about how you are waiting for his Son to come from heaven . God raised him from the dead . He is Jesus . He saves us from God's anger , and his anger is sure to come .
52002001	Brothers and sisters , you know that our visit to you was not a failure .
52002002	You know what happened earlier in the city of Philippi . We suffered , and people treated us badly there . But God gave us the boldness to tell you his good news . We preached to you even though people opposed us strongly .
52002003	The appeal we make is based on truth . It comes from a pure heart . We are not trying to trick you .
52002004	In fact , it is just the opposite . God has accepted us to preach . He has trusted us with the good news . We aren't trying to please people . We want to please God . He puts our hearts to the test .
52002005	As you know , we never praised you if we didn't mean it . We didn't put on a mask to cover up any sinful longing . God is our witness that this is true .
52002006	We were not expecting people to praise us . We were not looking for praise from you or anyone else . As Christ's apostles , we could have caused you some expense .
52002007	But we were gentle among you . We were like a mother caring for her little children .
52002008	We loved you so much that we were happy to share with you God's good news . We were also happy to share our lives with you . You had become very special to us .
52002009	Brothers and sisters , I am sure you remember how hard we worked . We labored night and day while we preached to you God's good news . We didn't want to cause you any expense .
52002010	You are witnesses of how we lived among you believers . God is also a witness that we were holy and godly and without blame .
52002011	You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children .
52002012	We gave you hope and strength . We comforted you . We really wanted you to live in a way that is worthy of God . He chooses you to enter his glorious kingdom .
52002013	We never stop thanking God for the way you received his word . You heard it from us . But you didn't accept it as a human word . You accepted it for what it really is . It is God's word . It is at work in you who believe .
52002014	Brothers and sisters , you became like the members of God's churches in Judea . They are believers in Christ Jesus , just as you are . People in your own country made you suffer . You went through the same things the church members in Judea suffered from the Jews .
52002015	The Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets also forced us to leave . They do not please God . They are enemies of everyone .
52002016	They try to keep us from speaking to those who aren't Jews . The Jews don't want them to be saved . In that way , the Jews always increase their sins to the limit . God's anger has come on them at last .
52002017	Brothers and sisters , we were torn away from you for a short time . We were no longer with you in person , but we kept you in our thoughts . We really longed to see you . So we tried very hard to do so .
52002018	We wanted to come to you . Again and again I , Paul , wanted to come . But Satan stopped us .
52002019	What is our hope ? What is our joy ? When our Lord Jesus returns , what is the crown we will delight in ? Isn't it you ?
52002020	Yes , you are our glory and our joy .
52003001	We couldn't wait any longer . So we thought it was best to be left by ourselves in Athens .
52003002	We sent our brother Timothy to give you strength and hope in your faith . He works together with God in spreading the good news about Christ .
52003003	We sent him so that no one would be upset by times of testing . You know very well that we have to go through them .
52003004	In fact , when we were with you , we kept telling you that our enemies would make us suffer . As you know very well , it has turned out that way .
52003005	That's the reason I sent someone to find out about your faith . I couldn't wait any longer . I was afraid that Satan might have tempted you in some way . Then our efforts would have been useless .
52003006	But Timothy has come to us from you just now . He has brought good news about your faith and love . He has told us that you always have happy memories of us . He has also said that you long to see us , just as we long to see you .
52003007	Brothers and sisters , in all our trouble and suffering your faith cheered us up .
52003008	Now we really live , because you are standing firm in the Lord .
52003009	How can we thank God enough for you because of all the joy that comes only from our God ?
52003010	Night and day we pray very hard that we will see you again . We want to give you what is missing in your faith .
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus open up a way for us to come to you .
52003012	May the Lord make your love grow . May it be like a rising flood . May your love for one another increase . May it also increase for everyone else . May it be just like our love for you .
52003013	May the Lord give you strength in your hearts . Then you will be holy and without blame in the sight of our God and Father . May that be true when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones .
52004001	Finally , brothers and sisters , we taught you how to live in a way that pleases God . In fact , that is how you are living . In the name of the Lord Jesus we ask and beg you to do it more and more .
52004002	You know the directions we gave you . They were given by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
52004003	God wants you to be made holy . He wants you to stay away from sexual sins .
52004004	He wants all of you to learn to control your own bodies . You must live in a way that is holy . You must live with honor .
52004005	Don't long to commit sexual sins like those who don't know God .
52004006	None of you should sin against your brother by doing that . You should not take advantage of him . The Lord will punish everyone who commits those kinds of sins . We have already told you and warned you about that .
52004007	God chose us to live pure lives . He wants us to be holy .
52004008	So if you refuse to accept my teaching , you turn your back on God , not on people . God gives you his Holy Spirit .
52004009	We don't need to write to you about love among believers . God himself has taught you to love each other .
52004010	In fact , you do love all the brothers and sisters all around Macedonia . But we are asking you to love each other more and more .
52004011	Do everything you can to live a quiet life . Mind your own business . Work with your hands , just as we told you to .
52004012	Then unbelievers will have respect for your everyday life . And you won't have to depend on anyone .
52004013	Brothers and sisters , we want you to know what happens to those who die . We don't want you to be sad , as other people are . They don't have any hope .
52004014	We believe that Jesus died and rose again . When he returns , many who believe in him will have died already . We believe that God will bring them back with Jesus .
52004015	That agrees with what the Lord has said . When the Lord comes , many of us will still be alive . We tell you that we will certainly not go up before those who have died .
52004016	The Lord himself will come down from heaven . We will hear a loud command . We will hear the voice of the leader of the angels . We will hear a blast from God's trumpet . Many who believe in Christ will have died already . They will rise first .
52004017	After that , we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them . We will be taken up in the clouds . We will meet the Lord in the air . And we will be with him forever .
52004018	So cheer each other up with these words of comfort .
52005001	Brothers and sisters , we don't have to write to you about times and dates .
52005002	You know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .
52005003	People will be saying that everything is peaceful and safe . Then suddenly they will be destroyed . It will happen like birth pains coming on a pregnant woman . None of the people will escape .
52005004	Brothers and sisters , you are not in darkness . So that day should not surprise you as a thief would .
52005005	All of you are children of the light . You are children of the day . We don't belong to the night . We don't belong to the darkness .
52005006	So let us not be like the others . They are asleep . Instead , let us be wide awake and in full control of ourselves .
52005007	Those who sleep , sleep at night . Those who get drunk , get drunk at night .
52005008	But we belong to the day . So let us control ourselves . Let us put the armor of faith and love on our chest . Let us put on the hope of salvation like a helmet .
52005009	God didn't choose us to receive his anger . He chose us to receive salvation because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done .
52005010	Jesus died for us . Some will be alive when he comes . Others will be dead . Either way , we will live together with him .
52005011	So cheer each other up with the hope you have . Build each other up . In fact , that's what you are doing .
52005012	Brothers and sisters , we ask you to have respect for the godly leaders who work hard among you . They have authority over you . They correct you .
52005013	Have a lot of respect for them . Love them because of what they do . Live in peace with each other .
52005014	Brothers and sisters , we are asking you to warn those who don't want to work . Cheer up those who are shy . Help those who are weak . Put up with everyone .
52005015	Make sure that nobody pays back one wrong act with another . Always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else .
52005016	Always be joyful .
52005017	Never stop praying .
52005018	Give thanks no matter what happens . God wants you to thank him because you believe in Christ Jesus .
52005019	Don't put out the Holy Spirit's fire .
52005020	Don't treat prophecies as if they amount to nothing .
52005021	Put everything to the test . Hold on to what is good .
52005022	Stay away from every kind of evil .
52005023	God is the God who gives peace . May he make you holy through and through . May your whole spirit , soul and body be kept free from blame . May you be without blame from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes .
52005024	The One who has chosen you is faithful . He will do all these things .
52005025	Brothers and sisters , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the believers with a holy kiss .
52005027	While the Lord is watching , here is what I command you . Have this letter read to all the believers .
52005028	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . Silas and Timothy join me in writing . We are sending this letter to you , the members of the church in Thessalonica . You belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001002	May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
53001003	Brothers and sisters , we should always thank God for you . That is only right , because your faith is growing more and more . The love you all have for each other is increasing .
53001004	So among God's churches we brag about the fact that you don't give up easily . We brag about your faith in all the suffering and testing you are going through .
53001005	All of this proves that when God judges , he is fair . So you will be considered worthy to enter God's kingdom . You are suffering for his kingdom .
53001006	God is fair . He will pay back trouble to those who give you trouble .
53001007	He will help you who are troubled . And he will also help us . All of those things will happen when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven . He will come in blazing fire . He will come with the angels who are given the power to do what God wants .
53001008	He will punish those who don't know God . He will punish those who don't obey the good news about our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will be destroyed forever . They will be shut out of heaven . They will never see the glory of the Lord's power .
53001010	All of those things will happen when he comes . On that day his glory will be seen in his holy people . Everyone who has believed will be amazed when they see him . That includes you , because you believed the witness we gave you .
53001011	Keeping this in mind , we never stop praying for you . Our God has chosen you . We pray that he will consider you worthy of his choice . We pray that by his power he will make every good thing you have planned come true . We pray that he will make perfect all that you have done by faith .
53001012	We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus will receive glory through what you have done . We also pray that you will receive glory through what he has done . We pray all these things in keeping with the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Brothers and sisters , we want to ask you something . It has to do with the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . It concerns the time when we will go to be with him .
53002002	What if you receive a prophecy , report or letter that is supposed to have come from us ? What if it says that the day of the Lord has already come ? If it does , we ask you not to become easily upset or alarmed .
53002003	Don't let anyone trick you in any way . That day will not come until people rise up against God . It will not come until the man of sin appears . He is a marked man . He is sentenced to be destroyed .
53002004	He will oppose everything that is called God . He will oppose everything that is worshiped . He will give himself power over everything . He will set himself up in God's temple . He will announce that he himself is God .
53002005	Don't you remember ? When I was with you , I used to tell you those things .
53002006	Now you know what is holding the man of sin back . He is held back so that he can make his appearance at the right time .
53002007	The secret power of sin is already at work . But the one who now holds that power back will keep doing it until he is taken out of the way .
53002008	Then the man of sin will appear . The Lord Jesus will overthrow him with the breath of his mouth . The glorious brightness of Jesus' coming will destroy the man of sin .
53002009	The coming of the man of sin will be Satan's work . His work will be seen in all kinds of fake miracles , signs and wonders .
53002010	It will be seen in every kind of evil that fools people who are dying . They are dying because they refuse to love the truth . The truth would save them .
53002011	So God will fool them completely . Then they will believe the lie .
53002012	Many will not believe the truth . They will take pleasure in evil . They will be judged .
53002013	Brothers and sisters , we should always thank God for you . The Lord loves you . God chose you from the beginning . He wanted you to be saved . Salvation comes through the Holy Spirit's work . He makes people holy . It also comes through believing the truth .
53002014	He chose you to be saved by accepting the good news that we preach . And you will share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	Brothers and sisters , stand firm . Hold on to what we taught you . We passed our teachings on to you by what we preached and wrote .
53002016	Our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father loved us . By his grace God gave us comfort that will last forever . The hope he gave us is good . May our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father
53002017	comfort your hearts . May they make you strong in every good thing you do and say .
53003001	Finally , brothers and sisters , pray for us . Pray that the Lord's message will spread quickly . Pray that others will honor it just as you did .
53003002	And pray that we will be saved from sinful and evil people . Not everyone is a believer .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful . He will strengthen you . He will guard you from the evil one .
53003004	We trust in the Lord . So we are sure that you are doing the things we tell you to do . And we are sure that you will keep on doing them .
53003005	May the Lord fill your hearts with God's love . May Christ give you the strength to go on .
53003006	Brothers and sisters , here is a command we give you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . Keep away from every believer who doesn't want to work . Keep away from anyone who doesn't live up to the teaching you received from us .
53003007	You know how you should follow our example . We worked when we were with you .
53003008	We didn't eat anyone's food without paying for it . In fact , it was just the opposite . We worked night and day . We worked very hard so that we wouldn't cause any expense to any of you .
53003009	We worked , even though we have the right to receive help from you . We did it in order to be a model for you to follow .
53003010	Even when we were with you , we gave you a rule . We said , " Anyone who will not work will not eat . "
53003011	We hear that some people among you don't want to work . They aren't really busy . Instead , they are bothering others .
53003012	We belong to the Lord Jesus Christ . So we strongly command people like that to settle down . They have to earn the food they eat .
53003013	Brothers and sisters , don't ever get tired of doing the right thing .
53003014	Keep an eye on anyone who doesn't obey the directions in our letter . Watch that person closely . Have nothing to do with him . Then he will feel ashamed .
53003015	But don't think of him as an enemy . Instead , warn him as a brother or sister .
53003016	May the Lord who gives peace give you peace at all times and in every way . May the Lord be with all of you .
53003017	I , Paul , write this greeting in my own handwriting . That's how I prove that I am the author of all my letters . I always do it that way .
53003018	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus , just as God our Savior commanded . Christ Jesus also commanded it . We have put our hope in him .
54001002	Timothy , I am sending you this letter . You are my true son in the faith . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace , mercy and peace .
54001003	Stay there in Ephesus . That is what I told you to do when I went into Macedonia . I want you to command certain people not to teach things that aren't true .
54001004	Command them not to spend their time on stories that aren't completely true . They must not waste time on family histories that never end . Things like that cause people to argue instead of doing God's work . His work is done by faith .
54001005	Love is the purpose of my command . Love comes from a pure heart . It comes from a good sense of what is right and wrong . It comes from faith that is honest and true .
54001006	Some have wandered away from those teachings . They would rather talk about things that have no meaning .
54001007	They want to be teachers of the law . And they are very sure about that law . But they don't know what they are talking about .
54001008	We know that the law is good if it is used properly .
54001009	We also know that the law isn't made for godly people . It is made for those who break the law . It is for those who refuse to obey . It is for ungodly and sinful people . It is for those who aren't holy and who don't believe . It is for those who kill their fathers or mothers . It is for murderers .
54001010	It is for those who commit adultery . It is for those who have a twisted view of sex . It is for people who buy and sell slaves . It is for liars . It is for those who give witness to things that aren't true . And it is for anything else that is the opposite of true teaching .
54001011	True teaching agrees with the glorious good news of the blessed God . He trusted me with that good news .
54001012	I am thankful to Christ Jesus our Lord . He has given me strength . I thank him that he considered me faithful . And I thank him for appointing me to serve him .
54001013	I used to speak evil things against Jesus . I tried to hurt his followers . I really pushed them around . But God showed me mercy anyway . I did those things without knowing any better . I wasn't a believer .
54001014	Our Lord poured out more and more of his grace on me . Along with it came faith and love from Christ Jesus .
54001015	Here is a saying that you can trust . It should be accepted completely . Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners . And I am the worst sinner of all .
54001016	But for that very reason , God showed me mercy . And I am the worst of sinners . He showed me mercy so that Christ Jesus could show that he is very patient . I was an example for those who would come to believe in him . Then they would receive eternal life .
54001017	The eternal King will never die . He can't be seen . He is the only God . Give him honor and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
54001018	My son Timothy , I give you these teachings . They are in keeping with the prophecies that were once made about you . By following them , you can fight the good fight .
54001019	Then you will hold on to faith . You will hold on to a good sense of what is right and wrong . Some have not accepted these teachings . By doing that , they have destroyed their faith . They are like a ship that has sunk .
54001020	Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them . I have handed them over to Satan . That will teach them not to speak evil things against God .
54002001	First , I want all of you to pray for everyone . Ask God to bless them . Give thanks for them .
54002002	Pray for kings . Pray for all who are in authority . Pray that we will live peaceful and quiet lives . And pray that we will be godly and holy .
54002003	That is good . It pleases God our Savior .
54002004	He wants everyone to be saved . He wants them to come to know the truth .
54002005	There is only one God . And there is only one go-between for God and human beings . He is the man Christ Jesus .
54002006	He gave himself to pay for the sins of everyone . That was a witness given by God at just the right time .
54002007	I was appointed to be a messenger and an apostle to preach the good news . I am telling the truth . I'm not lying . God appointed me to be a teacher of the true faith to those who aren't Jews .
54002008	I want men everywhere to pray . I want them to lift up holy hands . I don't want them to be angry when they pray . I don't want them to argue .
54002009	I also want women to dress simply . They should wear clothes that are right and proper . They shouldn't braid their hair . They shouldn't wear gold or pearls . They shouldn't spend too much on clothes .
54002010	Instead , they should put on good works as if they were their clothes . That is proper for women who claim to worship God .
54002011	When a woman is learning , she should be quiet . She should follow the leaders in every way .
54002012	I do not let women teach . I do not let them have authority over men . They must be quiet .
54002013	Adam was made first . Then Eve was made .
54002014	Adam was not the one who was tricked . The woman was tricked and became a sinner .
54002015	Will women be saved by having children ? Only if they keep on believing , loving , and leading a holy life in a proper way .
54003001	Here is a saying you can trust . If anyone wants to be a leader in the church , he wants to do a good work for God and people .
54003002	A leader must be free from blame . He must be faithful to his wife . In anything he does , he must not go too far . He must control himself . He must be worthy of respect . He must welcome people into his home . He must be able to teach .
54003003	He must not get drunk . He must not push people around . He must be gentle . He must not be a person who likes to argue . He must not love money .
54003004	He must manage his own family well . He must make sure that his children obey him and show him proper respect .
54003005	Suppose someone doesn't know how to manage his own family . Then how can he take care of God's church ?
54003006	The leader must not be a new believer . If he is , he might become proud . Then he would be judged just like the devil .
54003007	The leader must also be respected by those who are outside the church . Then he will not be put to shame . He will not fall into the devil's trap .
54003008	Deacons also must be worthy of respect . They must be honest and true . They must not drink too much wine . They must not try to get money by cheating people .
54003009	They must hold on to the deep truths of the faith . Even their own minds tell them to do that .
54003010	First they must be tested . Then let them serve as deacons if there is nothing against them .
54003011	In the same way , their wives must be worthy of respect . They must not say things that harm others . In anything they do , they must not go too far . They must be worthy of trust in everything .
54003012	A deacon must be faithful to his wife . He must manage his children and family well .
54003013	Those who have served well earn the full respect of others . They also become more sure of their faith in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I hope I can come to you soon . But now I am writing these directions to you .
54003015	Then if I have to put off my visit , you will know how you should act in God's family . The family of God is the church of the living God . It is the pillar and foundation of the truth .
54003016	There is no doubt that godliness is a great mystery . Jesus appeared in a body . The Holy Spirit proved that he was the Son of God . He was seen by angels . He was preached among the nations . People in the world believed in him . He was taken up to heaven in glory .
54004001	The Holy Spirit clearly says that in the last days some people will leave the faith . They will follow spirits that will fool them . They will believe things that demons will teach them .
54004002	Teachings like those come from liars who pretend to be what they are not . Their sense of what is right and wrong has been burned as if with a hot iron .
54004003	They do not allow people to get married . They order them not to eat certain foods . But God created those foods . So people who believe and know the truth should receive them and give thanks for them .
54004004	Everything God created is good . You shouldn't turn anything down . Instead , you should thank God for it .
54004005	The word of God and prayer make it holy .
54004006	Point these things out to the brothers and sisters . Then you will serve Christ Jesus well . You were brought up in the truths of the faith . You received good teaching . You followed it .
54004007	Don't have anything to do with godless stories and silly tales . Instead , train yourself to be godly .
54004008	Training the body has some value . But being godly has value in every way . It promises help for the life you are now living and the life to come .
54004009	Here is a saying you can trust . You can accept it completely .
54004010	We work hard for it . Here is the saying . We have put our hope in the living God . He is the Savior of all people . Most of all he is the Savior of those who believe .
54004011	Command those things . Teach them .
54004012	Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young . Set an example for the believers in what you say and in how you live . Also set an example in how you love and in what you believe . Show the believers how to be pure .
54004013	Until I come , spend your time reading Scripture out loud to one another . Spend your time preaching and teaching .
54004014	Don't fail to use the gift the Holy Spirit gave you . He gave it to you through a message from God . It was given when the elders placed their hands on you .
54004015	Keep on doing those things . Give them your complete attention . Then everyone will see how you are coming along .
54004016	Be careful of how you live and what you believe . Never give up . Then you will save yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	Don't tell an older man off . Make an appeal to him as if he were your father . Treat younger men as if they were your brothers .
54005002	Treat older women as if they were your mothers . Treat younger women as if they were your sisters . Be completely pure in the way you treat them .
54005003	Take care of the widows who really need help .
54005004	But suppose a widow has children or grandchildren . They should first learn to put their faith into practice . They should care for their own family . In that way they will pay back their parents and grandparents . That pleases God .
54005005	The widow who really needs help and is left all alone puts her hope in God . Night and day she keeps on praying . Night and day she asks God for help .
54005006	But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she is still living .
54005007	Give those directions to the people also . Then no one can be blamed .
54005008	Everyone should provide for his own relatives . Most of all , everyone should take care of his own family . If he doesn't , he has left the faith . He is worse than someone who doesn't believe .
54005009	No widow should be put on the list of widows unless she is more than 60 years old . She must also have been faithful to her husband .
54005010	She must be well known for the good things she does . That includes bringing up children . It includes inviting guests into her home . It includes washing the feet of God's people . It includes helping those who are in trouble . A widow should spend her time doing all kinds of good things .
54005011	Don't put younger widows on that kind of list . They might want pleasure more than they want Christ . Then they would want to get married again .
54005012	If they do that , they will be judged . They have broken their first promise .
54005013	Besides , they get into the habit of having nothing to do . They go around from house to house . They waste time . They talk about others . They bother people . They say things they shouldn't say .
54005014	So here is the advice I give to younger widows . Get married . Have children . Take care of your own homes . Don't give the enemy the chance to tell lies about you .
54005015	In fact , some have already turned away to follow Satan .
54005016	Suppose a woman is a believer and has widows in her family . She should help them . She shouldn't let the church pay the expenses . Then the church can help the widows who really need it .
54005017	The elders who do the church's work well are worth twice as much honor . That is true in a special way of elders who preach and teach .
54005018	Scripture says , " Do not stop the ox from eating while it helps separate the grain from the straw . " Scripture also says , " Workers are worthy of their pay . "
54005019	Don't believe a charge against an elder unless two or three witnesses bring it .
54005020	Elders who sin should be corrected in front of the other believers . That will be a warning to the others .
54005021	I command you to follow those directions . I command you in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels . Treat everyone the same . Don't favor one person over another .
54005022	Don't be too quick to place your hands on others to set them apart to serve God . Don't take part in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
54005023	Stop drinking only water . If your stomach is upset , drink a little wine . It can also help the other sicknesses you often have .
54005024	The sins of some people are easy to see . They are already being judged . Others will be judged later .
54005025	In the same way , good works are easy to see . But even good works that are hard to see can't stay hidden .
54006001	All who are forced to serve as slaves should consider their masters worthy of full respect . Then people will not speak evil things against God's name and against what we teach .
54006002	Some slaves have masters who are believers . They shouldn't show less respect for their masters just because they are believers . Instead , they should serve them even better . That's because those who benefit from their service are believers . They are loved by them . Teach the slaves those things . Try hard to get them to do them .
54006003	Suppose someone teaches ideas that are false . He doesn't agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ . He doesn't agree with godly teaching .
54006004	People like that are proud . They don't understand anything . They like to argue more than they should . They can't agree about what words mean . All of that results in wanting what others have . It causes fighting , harmful talk , and evil distrust .
54006005	It stirs up trouble all the time among people whose minds are twisted by sin . The truth they once had has been taken away from them . They think they can get rich by being godly .
54006006	You gain a lot when you live a godly life . But you must be happy with what you have .
54006007	We didn't bring anything into the world . We can't take anything out of it .
54006008	If we have food and clothing , we will be happy with that .
54006009	People who want to get rich are tempted . They fall into a trap . They are tripped up by wanting many foolish and harmful things . Those who live like that are dragged down by what they do . They are destroyed and die .
54006010	Love for money causes all kinds of evil . Some people want to get rich . They have wandered away from the faith . They have wounded themselves with many sorrows .
54006011	But you are a man of God . Run away from all of those things . Try hard to do what is right and godly . Have faith , love and gentleness . Hold on to what you believe .
54006012	Fight the good fight along with all other believers . Take hold of eternal life . You were chosen for it when you openly told others what you believe . Many witnesses heard you .
54006013	God gives life to everything . Christ Jesus told the truth when he gave witness to Pontius Pilate . In the sight of God and Christ , I give you a command .
54006014	Obey it until our Lord Jesus Christ appears . Obey it completely . Then no one can find fault with it or you .
54006015	God will bring Jesus back at a time that pleases him . God is the blessed and only Ruler . He is the greatest King of all . He is the most powerful Lord of all .
54006016	God is the only one who can't die . He lives in light that no one can get close to . No one has seen him . No one can see him . Give honor and power to him forever . Amen .
54006017	Command people who are rich in this world not to be proud . Tell them not to put their hope in riches . Wealth is so uncertain . Command those who are rich to put their hope in God . He richly provides us with everything to enjoy .
54006018	Command the rich to do what is good . Tell them to be rich in doing good things . They must give freely . They must be willing to share .
54006019	In that way they will put riches away for themselves . It will provide a firm basis for the next life . Then they will take hold of the life that really is life .
54006020	Timothy , guard what God has trusted you with . Turn away from godless chatter . Stay away from opposing ideas that are falsely called knowledge .
54006021	Some people believe them . By doing that they have wandered away from the faith . May God's grace be with you .
55001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Christ Jesus just as God planned . He sent me to tell about the promise of life that is found in Christ Jesus .
55001002	Timothy , I am sending you this letter . You are my dear son . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace , mercy and peace .
55001003	I serve God , knowing that what I have done is right . That is how our people served him long ago . Night and day I thank God for you . Night and day I always remember you in my prayers .
55001004	I remember your tears . I long to see you so that I can be filled with joy .
55001005	I remember your honest and true faith . It was alive first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice . And I am certain that it is now alive in you also .
55001006	That is why I remind you to help God's gift grow , just as a small spark grows into a fire . God put his gift in you when I placed my hands on you .
55001007	God didn't give us a spirit that makes us weak and fearful . He gave us a spirit that gives us power and love . It helps us control ourselves .
55001008	So don't be ashamed to give witness about our Lord . And don't be ashamed of me , his prisoner . Instead , join with me as I suffer for the good news . God's power will help us do that .
55001009	God has saved us . He has chosen us to live a holy life . It wasn't because of anything we have done . It was because of his own purpose and grace . Through Christ Jesus , God gave us that grace even before time began .
55001010	It has now been made known through the coming of our Savior , Christ Jesus . He has destroyed death . Because of the good news , he has brought life out into the light . That life never dies .
55001011	I was appointed to announce the good news . I was appointed to be an apostle and a teacher .
55001012	That's why I'm suffering the way I am . But I'm not ashamed . I know the One I have believed in . I am sure he is able to take care of what I have given him . I can trust him with it until the day he returns as judge .
55001013	Follow what you heard from me as the pattern of true teaching . Follow it with faith and love because you belong to Christ Jesus .
55001014	Guard the truth of the good news that you were trusted with . Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us .
55001015	You know that all the believers in Asia Minor have deserted me . They include Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord show mercy to all who live in the house of Onesiphorus . He often cheered me up . He was not ashamed that I was being held by chains .
55001017	In fact , it was just the opposite . When he was in Rome , he looked everywhere for me . At last he found me .
55001018	May Onesiphorus find mercy from the Lord on the day Jesus returns as judge . You know very well how many ways Onesiphorus helped me in Ephesus .
55002001	My son , be strong in the grace that is found in Christ Jesus .
55002002	You have heard me teach in front of many witnesses . Pass on to men you can trust the things you've heard me say . Then they will be able to teach others also .
55002003	Like a good soldier of Christ Jesus , share in the hard times with us .
55002004	A soldier does not take part in things that don't have anything to do with the army . He wants to please his commanding officer .
55002005	In the same way , anyone who takes part in a sport doesn't receive the winner's crown unless he plays by the rules .
55002006	The farmer who works hard should be the first to receive a share of the crops .
55002007	Think about what I'm saying . The Lord will help you understand what all of it means .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ . He came from David's family line . He was raised from the dead . That is my good news .
55002009	I am suffering for it . I have even been put in chains like someone who has committed a crime . But God's word is not held back by chains .
55002010	So I put up with everything for the good of God's chosen people . Then they also can be saved . Christ Jesus saves them . He gives them glory that will last forever .
55002011	Here is a saying you can trust . If we died with him , we will also live with him .
55002012	If we don't give up , we will also rule with him . If we say we don't know him , he will also say he doesn't know us .
55002013	Even if we are not faithful , he will remain faithful . He must be true to himself .
55002014	Keep reminding the believers of those things . While God is watching , warn them not to argue about words . That doesn't have any value . It only destroys those who listen .
55002015	Do your best to please God . Be a worker who doesn't need to be ashamed . Teach the message of truth correctly .
55002016	Stay away from godless chatter . Those who take part in it will become more and more ungodly .
55002017	Their teaching will spread like a deadly sickness . Hymenaeus and Philetus are two of those teachers .
55002018	They have wandered away from the truth . They say that the time when people will rise from the dead has already come . They destroy the faith of some people .
55002019	But God's solid foundation stands firm . Here is the message written on it . " The Lord knows who his own people are . " Also , " All who say they believe in the Lord must turn away from evil . "
55002020	In a large house there are things made out of gold and silver . But there are also things made out of wood and clay . Some have honorable purposes . Others do not .
55002021	Suppose someone stays away from what is not honorable . Then the Master will be able to use him for honorable purposes . He will be made holy . He will be ready to do any good work .
55002022	Run away from the evil things that young people long for . Try hard to do what is right . Have faith , love and peace . Do these things together with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart .
55002023	Don't have anything to do with arguing . It is dumb and foolish . You know it only leads to fights .
55002024	Anyone who serves the Lord must not fight . Instead , he must be kind to everyone . He must be able to teach . He must not hold anything against anyone .
55002025	He must gently teach those who oppose him . Maybe God will give a change of heart to those who are against you . That will lead them to know the truth .
55002026	Maybe they will come to their senses . Maybe they will escape the devil's trap . He has taken them prisoner to do what he wanted .
55003001	Here is what I want you to know . There will be terrible times in the last days .
55003002	People will love themselves . They will love money . They will brag and be proud . They will tear others down . They will not obey their parents . They won't be thankful or holy .
55003003	They won't love others . They won't forgive others . They will tell lies about people . They will be out of control . They will be wild . They will hate what is good .
55003004	They will turn against their friends . They will act without thinking . They will think they are better than others . They will love what pleases them instead of loving God .
55003005	They will act as if they were serving God . But what they do will show that they have turned their backs on God's power . Have nothing to do with those people .
55003006	They are the kind who worm their way into the homes of silly women . They get control over them . Women like that are loaded down with sins . They give in to all kinds of evil longings .
55003007	They are always learning . But they never come to know the truth .
55003008	Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses . In the same way , the teachers I'm talking about oppose the truth . Their minds are twisted . As far as the faith is concerned , God doesn't accept them .
55003009	They won't get very far . Just like Jannes and Jambres , their foolish ways will be clear to everyone .
55003010	But you know all about my teaching . You know how I live and what I live for . You know about my faith and love . You know how patient I am . You know I haven't given up .
55003011	You know that I was treated badly . You know that I suffered greatly . You know what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch , Iconium and Lystra . You know how badly I have been treated . But the Lord saved me from all of my troubles .
55003012	In fact , everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be treated badly .
55003013	Evil people and pretenders will go from bad to worse . They will fool others , and others will fool them .
55003014	But I want you to continue to follow what you have learned . Don't give up what you are sure of . You know the people you learned it from .
55003015	You have known the Holy Scriptures ever since you were a little child . They are able to teach you how to be saved by believing in Christ Jesus .
55003016	God has breathed life into all of Scripture . It is useful for teaching us what is true . It is useful for correcting our mistakes . It is useful for making our lives whole again . It is useful for training us to do what is right .
55003017	By using Scripture , a man of God can be completely prepared to do every good thing .
55004001	I give you a command in the sight of God and Christ Jesus . Christ will judge the living and the dead . Because he and his kingdom are coming , here is the command I give you .
55004002	Preach the word . Be ready to serve God in good times and bad . Correct people's mistakes . Warn them . Cheer them up with words of hope . Be very patient as you do these things . Teach them carefully .
55004003	The time will come when people won't put up with true teaching . Instead , they will try to satisfy their own longings . They will gather a large number of teachers around them . The teachers will say what the people want to hear .
55004004	The people will turn their ears away from the truth . They will turn to stories that aren't completely true .
55004005	But I want you to keep your head no matter what happens . Don't give up when times are hard . Work to spread the good news . Do everything God has given you to do .
55004006	I am already being poured out like a drink offering . The time has come for me to leave .
55004007	I have fought the good fight . I have finished the race . I have kept the faith .
55004008	Now there is a crown waiting for me . It is given to those who are right with God . The Lord , who judges fairly , will give it to me on the day he returns . He will not give it only to me . He will also give it to all those who are longing for him to return .
55004009	Do your best to come to me quickly .
55004010	Demas has deserted me . He has gone to Thessalonica . He left me because he loved this world . Crescens has gone to Galatia . Titus has gone to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you . He helps me in my work for the Lord .
55004012	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring my coat . I left it with Carpus at Troas . Also bring my scrolls . Most of all , bring the ones made out of animal skins .
55004014	Remember Alexander , the one who works with metal ? He did me a great deal of harm . The Lord will pay him back for what he has done .
55004015	You too should watch out for him . He strongly opposed our message .
55004016	The first time I was put on trial , no one came to help me . Everyone deserted me . I hope they will be forgiven for it .
55004017	The Lord stood at my side . He gave me the strength to preach the whole message . Then all those who weren't Jews heard it . I was saved from the lion's mouth .
55004018	The Lord will save me from every evil attack . He will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom . Give him glory for ever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Greet Priscilla and Aquila . Greet those who live in the house of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in Corinth . I left Trophimus sick in Miletus .
55004021	Do your best to get here before winter . Eubulus greets you . So do Pudens , Linus , Claudia and all the brothers .
55004022	May the Lord be with your spirit . May God's grace be with you .
56001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I serve God . I am an apostle of Jesus Christ . God sent me to help his chosen people believe in Christ . I have been sent to help them understand the truth that leads to godly living .
56001002	Faith and understanding rest on the hope of eternal life . Before time began , God promised to give that life . And he does not lie .
56001003	At just the right time he made his word plain . He did it through the preaching that he trusted me with . God our Savior has commanded all those things .
56001004	Titus , I am sending you this letter . You are my true son in the faith we share . May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace .
56001005	I left you on the island of Crete . There were some things that hadn't been finished . You needed to sort them out . You also had to appoint elders in every town . I told you how to do it .
56001006	An elder must be without blame . He must be faithful to his wife . His children must be believers . They must not give anyone a reason to say that they are wild and don't obey .
56001007	A church leader is trusted with God's work . That's why he must be without blame . He must not look after only his own interests . He must not get angry easily . He must not get drunk . He must not push people around . He must not try to get money by cheating people .
56001008	Instead , he must welcome people into his home . He must love what is good . He must control his mind and feelings . He must do what is right . He must be holy . He must control what his body longs for .
56001009	The message as it has been taught can be trusted . He must hold firmly to it . Then he will be able to use true teaching to comfort others and build them up . He will be able to prove that people who oppose it are wrong .
56001010	Many people refuse to obey God . All they do is talk a lot . They try to fool others . No one does these things more than the circumcision group .
56001011	They must be stopped . They are destroying entire families . They are teaching things they shouldn't . They do it to get money by cheating people .
56001012	Even one of their own prophets has said , " People from Crete are always liars . They are evil beasts . They don't want to work . They live only to eat . "
56001013	What I have just said is true . So give them a strong warning . Then they will understand the faith correctly .
56001014	They will pay no attention to Jewish stories that aren't completely true . They won't listen to the commands of those who turn away from the truth .
56001015	To people who are pure , all things are pure . But to those who have twisted minds and don't believe , nothing is pure . In fact , their minds and their sense of what is right and wrong are twisted .
56001016	They claim to know God . But their actions show they don't know him . They are hated by God . They refuse to obey him . They aren't fit to do anything good .
56002001	What you teach must agree with true teaching .
56002002	Tell the older men that in anything they do , they must not go too far . They must be worthy of respect . They must control themselves . They must have true faith . They must love others . They must not give up .
56002003	In the same way , teach the older women to lead a holy life . They must not tell lies about others . They must not let wine control them . Instead , they must teach what is good .
56002004	Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children .
56002005	The younger women must control themselves . They must be pure . They must take good care of their homes . They must be kind . They must follow the lead of their husbands . Then no one will be able to speak evil things against God's word .
56002006	In the same way , help the young men to control themselves .
56002007	Do what is good . Set an example for them in everything . When you teach , be honest and serious .
56002008	No one can question the truth . So teach what is true . Then those who oppose you will be ashamed . That's because they will have nothing bad to say about us .
56002009	Teach slaves to obey their masters in everything they do . Tell them to try to please their masters . They must not talk back to them .
56002010	They must not steal from them . Instead , they must show that they can be trusted completely . Then they will make the teaching about God our Savior appealing in every way .
56002011	God's saving grace has appeared to all people .
56002012	It teaches us to say no to godless ways and sinful longings . We must control ourselves . We must do what is right . We must lead godly lives in today's world .
56002013	That's how we should live as we wait for the blessed hope God has given us . We are waiting for Jesus Christ to appear in all his glory . He is our great God and Savior .
56002014	He gave himself for us . By doing that , he set us free from all evil . He wanted to make us pure . He wanted us to be his very own people . He wanted us to long to do what is good .
56002015	Those are the things you should teach . Cheer people up and give them hope . Correct them with full authority . Don't let anyone look down on you .
56003001	Remind God's people to obey rulers and authorities . Remind them to be ready to do what is good .
56003002	Tell them not to speak evil things against anyone . Remind them to live in peace . They must consider the needs of others . They must be kind and gentle toward all people .
56003003	At one time we too acted like fools . We didn't obey God . We were tricked . We were controlled by all kinds of longings and pleasures . We were full of evil . We wanted what belongs to others . People hated us , and we hated one another .
56003004	But the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared .
56003005	He saved us . It wasn't because of the good things we had done . It was because of his mercy . He saved us by washing away our sins . We were born again . The Holy Spirit gave us new life .
56003006	God poured out the Spirit on us freely because of what Jesus Christ our Savior has done .
56003007	His grace made us right with God . So now we have received the hope of eternal life as God's children .
56003008	You can trust that saying . Those things are important . Treat them that way . Then those who have trusted in God will be careful to commit themselves to doing what is good . Those things are excellent . They are for the good of everyone .
56003009	But keep away from foolish disagreements . Don't argue about family histories . Don't make trouble . Don't fight about what the law teaches . Don't argue about things like that . It doesn't do any good . It doesn't help anyone .
56003010	Warn anyone who tries to get believers to take sides and separate into their own little groups . Warn him more than once . After that , have nothing to do with him .
56003011	You can be sure that someone like that is twisted and sinful . His own actions judge him .
56003012	I will send Artemas or Tychicus to you . Then do your best to come to me at Nicopolis . I've decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos . Send them on their way . See that they have everything they need .
56003014	Our people must learn to commit themselves to doing what is good . Then they will be able to provide for the daily needs of others . If they do that , their lives won't turn out to be useless .
56003015	Everyone who is with me sends you greetings . Greet those who love us in the faith . May God's grace be with you all .
57001001	I , Paul , am writing this letter . I am a prisoner because of Christ Jesus . Our brother Timothy joins me in writing . Philemon , we are sending you this letter . You are our dear friend . You work together with us .
57001002	We are also sending it to our sister Apphia and to Archippus . He is a soldier of Christ together with us . And we are sending it to the church that meets in your home .
57001003	May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace .
57001004	I always thank my God when I remember you in my prayers .
57001005	That's because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus . I hear about your love for all of God's people .
57001006	I pray that you will be active in sharing what you believe . Then you will completely understand every good thing we have in Christ .
57001007	Your love has given me great joy . It has cheered me up . My brother , you have renewed the hearts of God's people .
57001008	Because of the authority Christ has given me , I could be bold . I could order you to do what you should do anyway .
57001009	But I make my appeal to you on the basis of our love for each other . I , Paul , am an old man . I am now also a prisoner because of Christ Jesus .
57001010	I make an appeal to you for my son Onesimus . He became a son to me while I was being held by chains .
57001011	Before that , he was useless to you . But now he has become useful to you and to me .
57001012	I'm sending Onesimus back to you . My very heart goes with him .
57001013	I would have liked to keep him with me . Then he could have taken your place in helping me while I'm being held by chains because of the good news .
57001014	But I didn't want to do anything unless you agreed . Any favor you do must be done because you want to do it , not because you have to .
57001015	Onesimus was separated from you for a little while . Maybe that was so you could have him back for good .
57001016	You could have him back not as a slave . Instead , he would be better than a slave . He would be a dear brother . He is very dear to me . But he is even more dear to you , both as a man and as a brother in the Lord .
57001017	Do you think of me as a believer who works together with you ? Then welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me .
57001018	Has he done anything wrong to you ? Does he owe you anything ? Then charge it to me .
57001019	I'll pay it back . I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand . I won't even mention that you owe me your very life .
57001020	My brother , I wish I could receive some benefit from you because we both belong to the Lord . Renew my heart . We know that Christ is the one who really renews it .
57001021	I'm sure you will obey . So I'm writing to you . I know you will do even more than I ask .
57001022	There is one more thing . Have a guest room ready for me . I hope I can return to all of you in answer to your prayers .
57001023	Epaphras sends you greetings . Together with me , he is a prisoner because of Christ Jesus .
57001024	Mark , Aristarchus , Demas and Luke work together with me . They also send you greetings .
57001025	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
58001001	In the past , God spoke to our people through the prophets . He spoke at many times . He spoke in different ways .
58001002	But in these last days , he has spoken to us through his Son . He is the one whom God appointed to receive all things . God made everything through him .
58001003	The Son is the gleaming brightness of God's glory . He is the exact likeness of God's being . He uses his powerful word to hold all things together . He provided the way for people to be made pure from sin . Then he sat down at the right hand of the King , the Majesty in heaven .
58001004	So he became higher than the angels . The name he received is more excellent than theirs .
58001005	God never said to any of the angels , " You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . " Or , " I will be his Father . And he will be my Son . "
58001006	God's first and only Son is over all things . When God brings him into the world , he says , " Let all of God's angels worship him . "
58001007	Here is something else God says about the angels . " God makes his angels to be like winds . He makes those who serve him to be like flashes of lightning . "
58001008	But here is what he says about the Son . " You are God . Your throne will last for ever and ever . Your kingdom will be ruled by what is right .
58001009	You have loved what is right and hated what is evil . So your God has placed you above your companions . He has filled you with joy by pouring the sacred oil on your head . "
58001010	He also says , " Lord , in the beginning you made the earth secure . You placed it on its foundations . The heavens are the work of your hands .
58001011	They will pass away . But you remain . They will all wear out like a piece of clothing .
58001012	You will roll them up like a robe . They will be changed as a person changes clothes . But you remain the same . Your years will never end . "
58001013	God never said to an angel , " Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your control . "
58001014	All angels are spirits who serve . God sends them to serve those who will receive salvation .
58002001	So we must pay more careful attention to what we have heard . Then we will not drift away from it .
58002002	Even the message God spoke through angels had to be obeyed . Every time people broke the Law , they were punished . Every time they didn't obey , they were punished .
58002003	Then how will we escape if we don't pay attention to God's great salvation ? The Lord first announced that salvation . Those who heard him gave us the message about it .
58002004	God gave witness to it through signs and wonders . He gave witness through different kinds of miracles . He also gave witness through the gifts of the Holy Spirit . He gave them out as it pleased him .
58002005	God has not put angels in charge of the world that is going to come . We are talking about that world .
58002006	There is a place where someone has given witness to it . He said , " What is a human being that you think about him ? What is the son of man that you take care of him ?
58002007	You made him a little lower than the angels . You placed on him a crown of glory and honor .
58002008	You have put everything under his control . " So God has put everything under him . Everything is under his control . We do not now see everything under his control .
58002009	But we do see Jesus already given a crown of glory and honor . He was made a little lower than the angels . He suffered death . By the grace of God , he tasted death for everyone . That is why he was given his crown .
58002010	God has made everything . He has acted in exactly the right way . He is bringing his many sons and daughters to share in his glory . To do so , he has made the One who saved them perfect because of his sufferings .
58002011	The One who makes people holy and the people he makes holy belong to the same family . So Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
58002012	He says , " I will announce your name to my brothers and sisters . I will sing your praises among those who worship you . "
58002013	Again he says , " I will put my trust in him . " And again he says , " Here I am . Here are the children God has given me . "
58002014	Those children have bodies made out of flesh and blood . So Jesus became human like them in order to die for them . By doing that , he could destroy the one who rules over the kingdom of death . I'm talking about the devil .
58002015	Jesus could set people free who were afraid of death . All their lives they were held as slaves by that fear .
58002016	It is certainly Abraham's children that he helps . He doesn't help angels .
58002017	So he had to be made like his brothers in every way . Then he could serve God as a kind and faithful high priest . And then he could pay for the sins of the people by dying for them .
58002018	He himself suffered when he was tempted . Now he is able to help others who are being tempted .
58003001	Holy brothers and sisters , God chose you to be his people . So keep thinking about Jesus . He is our apostle . He is our high priest . We believe in him .
58003002	Moses was faithful in everything he did in the house of God . In the same way , Jesus was faithful to the One who appointed him .
58003003	The person who builds a house has greater honor than the house itself . In the same way , Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses .
58003004	Every house is built by someone . But God is the builder of everything .
58003005	Moses was faithful as one who serves in the house of God . He gave witness to what God would say in days to come .
58003006	But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house . We are his house if we continue to come boldly to God . We must also hold on to the hope we take pride in .
58003007	The Holy Spirit says , " Listen to his voice today .
58003008	If you hear it , don't be stubborn . You were stubborn when you opposed me . You did that when you were put to the test in the desert .
58003009	There your people of long ago put me to the test . For 40 years they saw what I did .
58003010	That is why I was angry with them . I said , ' Their hearts are always going down the wrong path . They have not known my ways . '
58003011	So in my anger I took an oath . I said , ' They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them . ' "
58003012	Brothers and sisters , make sure that none of you has a sinful heart . Do not let an unbelieving heart turn you away from the living God .
58003013	But build one another up every day . Do it as long as there is still time . Then none of you will become stubborn . You won't be fooled by sin's tricks .
58003014	We belong to Christ if we hold firmly to the faith we had at first . But we must hold to it until the end .
58003015	It has just been said , " Listen to his voice today . If you hear it , don't be stubborn . You were stubborn when you opposed me . "
58003016	Who were those who heard and refused to obey ? Weren't they all the people Moses led out of Egypt ?
58003017	Who was God angry with for 40 years ? Wasn't it with those who sinned ? They died in the desert .
58003018	What people did God promise with an oath that they would never enjoy the rest he planned for them ? Wasn't it those who didn't obey ?
58003019	So we see that they weren't able to enter . That's because they didn't believe .
58004001	God's promise of enjoying his rest still stands . So be careful that none of you fails to receive it .
58004002	The good news was preached to our people long ago . It has also been preached to us . The message they heard didn't have any value for them . They didn't combine it with faith .
58004003	Now we who have believed enjoy that rest . God said , " When I was angry I took an oath . I said , ' They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them . ' " Ever since God created the world , his work has been finished .
58004004	Somewhere he spoke about the seventh day . He said , " On the seventh day God rested from all his work . "
58004005	In the part of Scripture I talked about earlier God said , " They will never enjoy the rest I planned for them . "
58004006	It is still true that some will enjoy that rest . But those who had the good news preached to them earlier didn't go in . That was because they didn't obey .
58004007	So God again chose a certain day . He named it Today . He did that when he spoke through David a long time later . As it was said earlier , " Listen to his voice today . If you hear it , don't be stubborn . "
58004008	Suppose Joshua had given them rest . If he had , God would not have spoken later about another day .
58004009	So there is still a Sabbath rest for God's people .
58004010	God rested from his work . Those who enjoy God's rest also rest from their work .
58004011	So let us make every effort to enjoy that rest . Then no one will fall into sin by following the example of those who didn't obey God .
58004012	The word of God is living and active . It is sharper than any sword that has two edges . It cuts deep enough to separate soul from spirit . It can separate joints from bones . It judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart .
58004013	Nothing God created is hidden from him . His eyes see everything . He will hold us accountable for everything we do .
58004014	We have a great high priest . He has gone up into the heavens . He is Jesus the Son of God . So let us hold firmly to what we say we believe .
58004015	We have a high priest who can feel it when we are weak and hurting . We have a high priest who has been tempted in every way , just as we are . But he did not sin .
58004016	So let us boldly approach the throne of grace . Then we will receive mercy . We will find grace to help us when we need it .
58005001	Every high priest is chosen from among men . He is appointed to act for them in everything that has to do with God . He offers gifts and sacrifices for their sins .
58005002	He is able to deal gently with those who have gone down the wrong path without knowing it . He can do that because he himself is weak .
58005003	That's why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins . He must also do it for the sins of the people .
58005004	No one can take that honor for himself . He must be appointed by God , just as Aaron was .
58005005	Even Christ did not take the glory of becoming a high priest for himself . God said to him , " You are my Son . Today I have become your Father . "
58005006	In another place he said , " You are a priest forever , just like Melchizedek . "
58005007	Jesus prayed while he lived on earth . He made his appeal with loud cries and tears . He prayed to the One who could save him from death . God heard him because he truly honored God .
58005008	Jesus was God's Son . But by suffering he learned what it means to obey .
58005009	In that way he was made perfect . Eternal salvation comes from him . He saves all those who obey him .
58005010	God appointed him to be the high priest , just like Melchizedek .
58005011	We have a lot to say about that . But it is hard to explain it to you . You learn too slowly .
58005012	By this time you should be teachers . But in fact , you need someone to teach you all over again . You need even the simple truths of God's word . You need milk , not solid food .
58005013	Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby . That person does not want to learn about living a godly life .
58005014	Solid food is for those who are grown up . They have trained themselves with a lot of practice . They can tell the difference between good and evil .
58006001	So let us leave the simple teachings about Christ . Let us grow up as believers . Let us not start all over again with the basic teachings . They taught us that we need to turn away from doing things that lead to death . They taught us that we must have faith in God .
58006002	They taught us about different kinds of baptism . They taught us about placing hands on people . They taught us that people will rise from the dead . They taught us that God will judge everyone . And they taught us that what he decides will last forever .
58006003	If God permits , we will go beyond those teachings and grow up .
58006004	What if some people fall away from the faith ? It won't be possible to bring them back . It is true that they have seen the light . They have tasted the heavenly gift . They have shared in the Holy Spirit .
58006005	They have tasted the good things of God's word . They have tasted the powers of the age to come .
58006006	But they have fallen away from the faith . So it won't be possible to bring them back . They won't be able to turn away from their sins . They are losing everything . That's because they are nailing the Son of God to the cross all over again . They are bringing shame on him in front of everyone .
58006007	Some land drinks the rain that falls on it . It produces a crop that is useful to those who farm the land . That land receives God's blessing .
58006008	But other land produces only thorns and weeds . That land isn't worth anything . It is in danger of coming under God's curse . In the end , it will be burned .
58006009	Dear friends , we have to say these things . But we are sure of better things in your case . We are talking about the things that go along with being saved .
58006010	God is fair . He will not forget what you have done . He will remember the love you have shown him . You showed it when you helped his people . And you show it when you keep on helping them .
58006011	We want each of you to be faithful to the very end . We want you to be sure of what you hope for .
58006012	We don't want you to slow down . Instead , be like those who have faith and are patient . They will receive what God promised .
58006013	When God made his promise to Abraham , he took an oath to keep it . But there was no one greater than himself to take an oath by . So he took his oath by making an appeal to himself .
58006014	He said , " I will certainly bless you . I will give you many children . "
58006015	Abraham was patient while he waited . Then he received what God promised him .
58006016	People take oaths by someone greater than themselves . An oath makes a promise certain . It puts an end to all arguing .
58006017	So God took an oath when he made his promise . He wanted to make it very clear that his purpose does not change . He wanted those who would receive what was promised to know that .
58006018	God took an oath so we would have good reason not to give up . We have run away from everything else to take hold of the hope offered to us in God's promise . So God gave his promise and his oath . Those two things can't change . He couldn't lie about them .
58006019	Our hope is certain . It is something for the soul to hold on to . It is strong and secure . It goes all the way into the Most Holy Room behind the curtain .
58006020	That is where Jesus has gone . He went there to open the way ahead of us . He has become a high priest forever , just like Melchizedek .
58007001	Melchizedek was the king of Salem . He was the priest of God Most High . He met Abraham , who was returning from winning a battle over some kings . Melchizedek blessed him .
58007002	Abraham gave him a tenth of everything . First , the name Melchizedek means " king of what is right . " Also , " king of Salem " means " king of peace . "
58007003	Melchizedek has no father or mother . He has no family line . His days have no beginning . His life has no end . He remains a priest forever , just like the Son of God .
58007004	Think how great Melchizedek was . Even our father Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had captured .
58007005	Now the law lays down a rule for the sons of Levi who become priests . They must collect a tenth from the people . They must collect it even from those who belong to the family line of Abraham .
58007006	Melchizedek did not trace his family line from Levi . But he collected a tenth from Abraham . Melchizedek blessed the one who had received the promises .
58007007	Without a doubt , the more important person blesses the less important one .
58007008	In the one case , the tenth is collected by men who die . But in the other case , it is collected by the one who is said to be living .
58007009	Levi collects the tenth . But we might say that Levi paid the tenth through Abraham .
58007010	That's because when Melchizedek met Abraham , Levi was still in Abraham's body .
58007011	Suppose the Levites who were priests could have made people perfect . The law was given to the people so they could become perfect through the priests . Then why was there still a need for another priest to come ? And why did he need to be like Melchizedek ? Why wasn't he from Aaron's family line ?
58007012	A change of priests requires a change of law .
58007013	Those things are said about one who is from a different tribe . No one from that tribe has ever served at the altar .
58007014	It is clear that our Lord came from the family line of Judah . Moses said nothing about priests who were from that tribe .
58007015	But suppose another priest like Melchizedek appears . Then what we have said is even more clear .
58007016	He has not become a priest because of a rule about his family line . He has become a priest because of his powerful life . His life can never be destroyed .
58007017	Scripture says , " You are a priest forever , just like Melchizedek . "
58007018	The old rule is done away with . It was weak and useless .
58007019	The law didn't make anything perfect . Now a better hope has been given to us . That hope brings us near to God .
58007020	The change of priests was made with an oath . Others became priests without any oath .
58007021	But Jesus became a priest with an oath . God said to him , " The Lord has taken an oath and made a promise . He will not change his mind . He has said , ' You are a priest forever . ' "
58007022	Because of that oath , Jesus makes the promise of a better covenant certain .
58007023	There were many priests in Levi's family line . Death kept them from continuing in office .
58007024	But Jesus lives forever . So he always holds the office of priest .
58007025	People now come to God through him . And he is able to save them completely and for all time . Jesus lives forever . He prays for them .
58007026	A high priest like that meets our need . He is holy , pure and without blame . He isn't like other people . He does not sin . He is lifted high above the heavens .
58007027	He isn't like the other high priests . They need to offer sacrifices day after day . First they bring offerings for their own sins . Then they do it for the sins of the people . But Jesus gave one sacrifice for the sins of the people . He gave it once and for all time . He did it by offering himself .
58007028	The law appoints men who are weak to be high priests . But God's oath came after the law . The oath appointed the Son . He has been made perfect forever .
58008001	Here is the point of what we are saying . We have a high priest like that . He sat down at the right hand of the throne of the King , the Majesty in heaven .
58008002	He serves in the sacred tent . The Lord set up the true holy tent . A mere man did not set it up .
58008003	Every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . So that priest also had to have something to offer .
58008004	What if he were on earth ? Then he would not be a priest . There are already priests who offer the gifts required by the law .
58008005	They serve at a sacred tent . But it is only a copy and shadow of what is in heaven . That's why God warned Moses when he was about to build the holy tent . God said , " Be sure to make everything just like the pattern I showed you on the mountain . "
58008006	Jesus has been given a greater work to do for God . He is the go-between for the new covenant . That covenant is better than the old one . It is based on better promises .
58008007	Suppose nothing had been wrong with that first covenant . Then no one would have looked for another covenant .
58008008	But God found fault with the people . He said , " A new day is coming , says the Lord . I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel . I will also make it with the people of Judah .
58008009	It will not be like the covenant I made with their people of long ago . That was when I took them by the hand . I led them out of Egypt . My new covenant will be different because they didn't remain faithful to my old covenant . So I turned away from them , says the Lord .
58008010	This is the covenant I will make with Israel after that time , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their minds . I will write them on their hearts . I will be their God . And they will be my people .
58008011	A man will not teach his neighbor anymore . And he will not teach his friend anymore . He will not say , ' Know the Lord . ' Everyone will know me . From the least important of them to the most important , all of them will know me .
58008012	I will forgive their evil ways . I will not remember their sins anymore . "
58008013	God called that covenant " new . " So he has made the first one out of date . And what is out of date and getting older will soon disappear .
58009001	The first covenant had rules for worship . It also had a sacred tent on earth .
58009002	A holy tent was set up . The lampstand was in the first room . So were the table and the holy bread . That was called the Holy Room .
58009003	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Room .
58009004	It had the golden altar for incense . It also had the wooden chest called the ark of the covenant . The ark was covered with gold . It held the gold jar of manna . It held Aaron's wooden staff that had budded . It also held the stone tablets . The words of the covenant were written on them .
58009005	The cherubim were above the ark . God showed his glory there . The cherubim spread their wings over the place where sin was paid for . But we can't deal with those things more completely now .
58009006	That's how everything was arranged in the holy tent . The priests entered it at regular times . They went into the outer room to do their work for God and others .
58009007	But only the high priest went into the inner room . He went in only once a year . He never entered without taking blood with him . He offered the blood for himself . He also offered it for the sins the people had committed because they didn't know any better .
58009008	Here is what the Holy Spirit was showing us . He was telling us that God had not yet clearly shown the way into the Most Holy Room . It would not be clearly shown as long as the first holy tent was still standing .
58009009	That's an example for the present time . It shows us that the gifts and sacrifices they offered were not enough . They were not able to remove the worshiper's feelings of guilt .
58009010	They deal only with food and drink and different kinds of special washings . They are rules that deal with things outside our bodies . People had to obey them only until the new covenant came .
58009011	Christ came to be the high priest of the good things that are already here . When he came , he went through the greater and more perfect holy tent . The tent was not made by people . In other words , it is not a part of this creation .
58009012	He did not enter by spilling the blood of goats and calves . He entered the Most Holy Room by spilling his own blood . He did it once and for all time . He paid the price to set us free from sin forever .
58009013	The blood of goats and bulls is sprinkled on people . So are the ashes of a young cow . They are sprinkled on people the Law called unclean . The people are sprinkled to make them holy . That makes them clean on the outside .
58009014	But Christ offered himself to God without any flaw . He did this through the power of the eternal Holy Spirit . So how much more will his blood wash from our minds our feelings of guilt for committing sin ! Sin always leads to death . But now we can serve the living God .
58009015	That's why Christ is the go-between of a new covenant . Now those God calls to himself will receive the eternal gift he promised . They will receive it now that Christ has died to save them . He died to set them free from the sins they committed under the first covenant .
58009016	What happens in the case of a will ? It is necessary to prove that the person who made the will has died .
58009017	A will is in effect only when somebody has died . It never takes effect while the one who made it is still living .
58009018	That's why even the first covenant was not put into effect without the spilling of blood .
58009019	Moses first announced every commandment of the law to all the people . Then he took the blood of calves . He also took water , bright red wool and branches of a hyssop plant . He sprinkled the scroll . He also sprinkled all of the people .
58009020	He said , " This is the blood of the covenant God has commanded you to keep . "
58009021	In the same way , he sprinkled the holy tent with blood . He also sprinkled everything that was used in worship there .
58009022	In fact , the law requires that nearly everything be made clean with blood . Without the spilling of blood , no one can be forgiven .
58009023	So the copies of the heavenly things had to be made pure with those sacrifices . But the heavenly things themselves had to be made pure with better sacrifices .
58009024	Christ did not enter a sacred tent made by people . That tent was only a copy of the true one . He entered heaven itself . He did it to stand in front of God for us . He is there right now .
58009025	The high priest enters the Most Holy Room every year . He enters with blood that is not his own . But Christ did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again .
58009026	If he had , he would have had to suffer many times since the world was created . But now he has appeared once and for all time . He has come at the end of the ages to do away with sin . He has done that by offering himself .
58009027	People have to die once . After that , God will judge them .
58009028	In the same way , Christ was offered up once . He took away the sins of many people . He will also come a second time . At that time he will not suffer for sin . Instead , he will come to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .
58010001	The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming . It is not the real things themselves . The same sacrifices have to be offered over and over again . They must be offered year after year . That's why the law can never make perfect those who come near to worship .
58010002	If it could , wouldn't the sacrifices have stopped being offered ? The worshipers would have been made clean once and for all time . They would not have felt guilty for their sins anymore .
58010003	But those offerings remind people of their sins every year .
58010004	It isn't possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	So when Christ came into the world , he said , " You didn't want sacrifices and offerings . Instead , you prepared a body for me .
58010006	You weren't pleased with burnt offerings and sin offerings .
58010007	Then I said , ' Here I am . It is written about me in the scroll . God , I have come to do what you want . ' "
58010008	First Christ said , " You didn't want sacrifices and offerings . You didn't want burnt offerings and sin offerings . You weren't pleased with them . " He said that even though the law required people to bring them .
58010009	Then he said , " Here I am . I have come to do what you want . " He did away with the first . He did it to put the second in place .
58010010	We have been made holy by what God wanted . We have been made holy because Jesus Christ offered his body once and for all time .
58010011	Day after day every priest stands and does his special duties . He offers the same sacrifices again and again . But they can never take away sins .
58010012	Jesus our priest offered one sacrifice for sins for all time . Then he sat down at the right hand of God .
58010013	Since that time , he waits for his enemies to be put under his control .
58010014	By that one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy .
58010015	The Holy Spirit also gives witness to us about this . First he says ,
58010016	" This is the covenant I will make with them after that time , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their hearts . I will write my laws on their minds . "
58010017	Then he adds , " I will not remember their sins anymore . I will not remember the evil things they have done . "
58010018	Where those have been forgiven , there is no longer any offering for sin .
58010019	Brothers and sisters , we are not afraid to enter the Most Holy Room . We enter boldly because of the blood of Jesus .
58010020	His way is new because he lives . It has been opened for us through the curtain . I'm talking about his body .
58010021	We also have a great priest over the house of God .
58010022	So let us come near to God with an honest and true heart . Let us come near with a faith that is sure and strong . Our hearts have been sprinkled . Our minds have been cleansed from a sense of guilt . Our bodies have been washed with pure water .
58010023	Let us hold firmly to the hope we claim to have . The One who promised is faithful .
58010024	Let us consider how we can stir up one another to love . Let us help one another to do good works .
58010025	Let us not give up meeting together . Some are in the habit of doing this . Instead , let us cheer each other up with words of hope . Let us do it all the more as you see the day coming when Christ will return .
58010026	What if we keep sinning on purpose ? What if we do it even after we know the truth ? Then there is no offering for our sins .
58010027	All we can do is to wait in fear for God to judge . His blazing fire will burn up his enemies .
58010028	Anyone who did not obey the law of Moses died without mercy if there were two or three witnesses .
58010029	What should be done to anyone who has hated the Son of God or has said no to him ? What should be done to a person who treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that makes him holy ? What should be done to someone who has made fun of the Holy Spirit who brings God's grace ? Don't you think people like that should be punished more than anyone else ?
58010030	We know the One who said , " I am the One who judges people . I will pay them back . " Scripture also says , " The Lord will judge his people . "
58010031	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	Remember those earlier days after you received the light . At that time you stood firm in a great struggle . You did it even in the face of suffering .
58010033	Sometimes you were made fun of in front of others . You were treated badly . At other times you stood side by side with people who were being treated like that .
58010034	You suffered together with people in prison . When your property was taken from you , you accepted it with joy . You knew that God had given you better and more lasting things .
58010035	So don't throw away your bold faith . It will bring you rich rewards .
58010036	You need to be faithful . Then you will do what God wants . You will receive what he has promised .
58010037	In just a very little while , " The one who is coming will come . He will not wait .
58010038	The one who is in the right will live by faith . If he pulls back , I will not be pleased with him . "
58010039	But we aren't people who pull back and are destroyed . We are people who believe and are saved .
58011001	Faith is being sure of what we hope for . It is being certain of what we do not see .
58011002	That is what the people of long ago were praised for .
58011003	We have faith . So we understand that everything was made when God commanded it . That's why we believe that what we see was not made out of what could be seen .
58011004	Abel had faith . So he offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did . Because of his faith Abel was praised as a godly man . God said good things about his offerings . Because of his faith Abel still speaks . He speaks even though he is dead .
58011005	Enoch had faith . So he was taken from this life . He didn't die . He just couldn't be found . God had taken him away . Before God took him , Enoch was praised as one who pleased God .
58011006	Without faith it isn't possible to please God . Those who come to God must believe that he exists . And they must believe that he rewards those who look to him .
58011007	Noah had faith . So he built an ark to save his family . He built it because of his great respect for God . God had warned him about things that could not yet be seen . Because of his faith he showed the world that it was guilty . Because of his faith he was considered right with God .
58011008	Abraham had faith . So he obeyed God . God called him to go to a place he would later receive as his own . So he went . He did it even though he didn't know where he was going .
58011009	Because of his faith he made his home in the land God had promised him . He was like an outsider in a strange country . He lived there in tents . So did Isaac and Jacob . They received the same promise he did .
58011010	Abraham was looking forward to the city that has foundations . He was waiting for the city that God planned and built .
58011011	Abraham had faith . So God made it possible for him to become a father . He became a father even though he was too old . Sarah also was too old to have children . But Abraham believed that the One who made the promise was faithful .
58011012	Abraham was past the time when he could have children . But many children came from that one man . They were as many as the stars in the sky . They were as many as the sand on the seashore . No one could count them .
58011013	All those people were still living by faith when they died . They didn't receive the things God had promised . They only saw them and welcomed them from a long way off . They openly said that they were outsiders and strangers on earth .
58011014	People who say things like that show that they are looking for a country of their own .
58011015	What if they had been thinking of the country they had left ? Then they could have returned to it .
58011016	Instead , they longed for a better country . They wanted one in heaven . So God is pleased when they call him their God . In fact , he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	Abraham had faith . So he offered Isaac as a sacrifice . That happened when God put him to the test . Abraham had received the promises . But he was about to offer his one and only son .
58011018	God had said to him , " Your family line will continue through Isaac . " Even so , Abraham was going to offer him up .
58011019	Abraham believed that God could raise the dead . In a way , he did receive Isaac back from death .
58011020	Isaac had faith . So he blessed Jacob and Esau . He told them what was ahead for them .
58011021	Jacob had faith . So he blessed each of Joseph's sons . He blessed them when he was dying . Because of his faith he worshiped God as he leaned on the top of his wooden staff .
58011022	Joseph had faith . So he spoke to the people of Israel about their leaving Egypt . He gave directions about his bones . He did that toward the end of his life .
58011023	Moses' parents had faith . So they hid him for three months after he was born . They saw he was a special child . They were not afraid of the king's command .
58011024	Moses had faith . So he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter . That happened after he had grown up .
58011025	He chose to be treated badly together with the people of God . He chose that instead of enjoying sin's pleasures for a short time .
58011026	He suffered shame because of Christ . He thought it had great value . He considered it better than the riches of Egypt . He was looking ahead to God's reward .
58011027	Because of his faith he left Egypt . It wasn't because he was afraid of the king's anger . He didn't let anything stop him . He saw the One who can't be seen .
58011028	Because of his faith he was the first to keep the Passover Feast . He commanded the people of Israel to sprinkle blood on their doorways . He did it so that the destroying angel would not touch their oldest sons .
58011029	The people had faith . So they passed through the Red Sea . They went through it as if it were dry land . The Egyptians tried to do it also . But they drowned .
58011030	The people had faith . So the walls of Jericho fell down . It happened after they had marched around the city for seven days .
58011031	Rahab , the prostitute , had faith . So she welcomed the spies . That's why she wasn't killed with those who didn't obey God .
58011032	What more can I say ? I don't have time to tell about all the others . I don't have time to talk about Gideon , Barak , Samson and Jephthah . I don't have time to tell about David , Samuel and the prophets .
58011033	Because of their faith they took over kingdoms . They ruled fairly . They received the blessings God had promised . They shut the mouths of lions .
58011034	They put out great fires . They escaped being killed by the sword . Their weakness was turned to strength . They became powerful in battle . They beat back armies from other countries .
58011035	Women received their dead back . The dead were raised to life again . Others were made to suffer greatly . But they refused to be set free . They did that so that after death they would be raised to a better life .
58011036	Some were laughed at . Some were whipped . Still others were held by chains . They were put in prison .
58011037	Some were killed with stones . They were sawed in two . They were put to death by the sword . They went around wearing the skins of sheep and goats . They were poor . They were attacked . They were treated badly .
58011038	The world was not worthy of them . They wandered in deserts and mountains . They lived in caves . They lived in holes in the ground .
58011039	All of those people were praised because they had faith . But none of them received what God had promised .
58011040	God had planned something better for us . So they would only be made perfect together with us .
58012001	A huge cloud of witnesses is all around us . So let us throw off everything that stands in our way . Let us throw off any sin that holds on to us so tightly . Let us keep on running the race marked out for us .
58012002	Let us keep looking to Jesus . He is the author of faith . He also makes it perfect . He paid no attention to the shame of the cross . He suffered there because of the joy he was looking forward to . Then he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	He put up with attacks from sinners . So think about him . Then you won't get tired . You won't lose hope .
58012004	You struggle against sin . But you have not yet fought to the point of spilling your blood .
58012005	You have forgotten that word of hope . It speaks to you as children . It says , " My son , think of the Lord's training as important . Do not lose hope when he corrects you .
58012006	The Lord trains those he loves . He punishes everyone he accepts as a son . "
58012007	Put up with hard times . God uses them to train you . He is treating you as children . What children are not trained by their parents ?
58012008	God trains all of his children . But what if he doesn't train you ? Then you are like children of people who weren't married to each other . You are not truly God's children .
58012009	Besides , we have all had human parents who trained us . We respected them for it . How much more should we be trained by the Father of our spirits and live !
58012010	Our parents trained us for a little while . They did what they thought was best . But God trains us for our good . He wants us to share in his holiness .
58012011	No training seems pleasant at the time . In fact , it seems painful . But later on it produces a harvest of godliness and peace . It does that for those who have been trained by it .
58012012	So lift your sagging arms . Strengthen your weak knees .
58012013	" Make level paths for your feet to walk on . " Then those who have trouble walking won't be disabled . Instead , they will be healed .
58012014	Try your best to live in peace with everyone . Try to be holy . Without holiness no one will see the Lord .
58012015	Be sure that no one misses God's grace . See to it that a bitter plant doesn't grow up . If it does , it will cause trouble . And it will pollute many people .
58012016	See to it that no one commits sexual sins . See to it that no one is godless like Esau . He sold the rights to what he would receive as the oldest son . He sold them for a single meal .
58012017	As you know , after that he wanted to receive his father's blessing . But he was turned away . With tears he tried to get the blessing . But he couldn't get his father to change his mind .
58012018	You haven't come to a mountain that can be touched . You haven't come to a mountain that is burning with fire . You haven't come to darkness , gloom and storm .
58012019	You haven't come to a blast from God's trumpet . You haven't come to a voice speaking to you . When people heard that voice long ago , they begged it not to say anything more to them .
58012020	What God commanded was too much for them . He said , " If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be killed with stones . "
58012021	The sight was terrifying . Moses said , " I am trembling with fear . "
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion . You have come to the Jerusalem in heaven . It is the city of the living God . You have come to a joyful gathering of angels . There are thousands and thousands of them .
58012023	You have come to the church of God's people . God's first and only Son is over all things . God's people share in what belongs to his Son . Their names are written in heaven . You have come to God . He is the judge of all people . You have come to the spirits of godly people who have been made perfect .
58012024	You have come to Jesus . He is the go-between of a new covenant . You have come to the sprinkled blood . It promises better things than the blood of Abel .
58012025	Be sure that you don't say no to the One who speaks . People did not escape when they said no to the One who warned them on earth . And what if we turn away from the One who warns us from heaven ? How much less will we escape !
58012026	At that time his voice shook the earth . But now he has promised , " Once more I will shake the earth . I will also shake the heavens . "
58012027	The words " once more " point out that what can be shaken can be taken away . I'm talking about created things . Then what can't be shaken will remain .
58012028	We are receiving a kingdom that can't be shaken . So let us be thankful . Then we can worship God in a way that pleases him . We will worship him with deep respect and wonder .
58012029	Our " God is like a fire that burns everything up . "
58013001	Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters .
58013002	Don't forget to welcome strangers . By doing that , some people have welcomed angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember those in prison as if you were in prison with them . And remember those who are treated badly as if you yourselves were suffering .
58013004	All of you should honor marriage . You should keep the marriage bed pure . God will judge the person who commits adultery . He will judge everyone who commits sexual sins .
58013005	Don't be controlled by love for money . Be happy with what you have . God has said , " I will never leave you . I will never desert you . "
58013006	So we can say boldly , " The Lord helps me . I will not be afraid . What can a mere man do to me ? "
58013007	Remember your leaders . They spoke God's word to you . Think about the results of their way of life . Copy their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
58013009	Don't be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings . It is good that God's grace makes our hearts strong . Don't depend on foods the Law requires . They have no value for the people who eat them .
58013010	Some worship at the holy tent . But we have an altar that they have no right to eat from .
58013011	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Room . He brings their blood as a sin offering . But the bodies are burned outside the camp .
58013012	Jesus also suffered outside the city gate . He suffered to make the people holy by spilling his own blood .
58013013	So let us go to him outside the camp . Let us be willing to suffer the shame he suffered .
58013014	Here we do not have a city that lasts . But we are looking for the city that is going to come .
58013015	So let us never stop offering to God our praise through Jesus . Let us offer it as the fruit of lips that say they believe in him .
58013016	Don't forget to do good . Don't forget to share with others . God is pleased with those kinds of offerings .
58013017	Obey your leaders . Put yourselves under their authority . They keep watch over you . They know they are accountable to God for everything they do . Obey them so that their work will be a joy . If you make their work a heavy load , it won't do you any good .
58013018	Pray for us . We feel sure we have done what is right . We long to live as we should in every way .
58013019	I beg you to pray that I may return to you soon .
58013020	Our Lord Jesus is the great Shepherd of the sheep . The God who gives peace brought him back from the dead . He did it because of the blood of the eternal covenant . May God
58013021	supply you with everything good . Then you can do what he wants . May he do in us what is pleasing to him . We can do it only with the help of Jesus Christ . Give him glory for ever and ever . Amen .
58013022	Brothers and sisters , I beg you to accept my word . It tells you to be faithful . I have written you only a short letter .
58013023	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been set free . If he arrives soon , I will come with him to see you .
58013024	Greet all of your leaders . Greet all of God's people . The believers from Italy send you their greetings .
58013025	May grace be with you all .
59001001	I , James , am writing this letter . I serve God and the Lord Jesus Christ . I am sending this letter to you , the 12 tribes that are scattered among the nations . Greetings .
59001002	My brothers and sisters , you will face all kinds of trouble . When you do , think of it as pure joy .
59001003	Your faith will be put to the test . You know that when that happens it will produce in you the strength to continue .
59001004	The strength to keep going must be allowed to finish its work . Then you will be all you should be . You will have everything you need .
59001005	If any of you need wisdom , ask God for it . He will give it to you . God gives freely to everyone . He doesn't find fault .
59001006	But when you ask , you must believe . You must not doubt . People who doubt are like waves of the sea . The wind blows and tosses them around .
59001007	A man like that shouldn't expect to receive anything from the Lord .
59001008	He can't make up his mind . He can never decide what to do .
59001009	A believer who finds himself in a low position in life should be proud that God has given him a high position .
59001010	But someone who is rich should take pride in his low position . That's because he will fade away like a wild flower .
59001011	The sun rises . Its burning heat dries up the plants . Their blossoms fall . Their beauty is destroyed . In the same way , a rich person will fade away even as he goes about his business .
59001012	Blessed is the man who keeps on going when times are hard . After he has come through them , he will receive a crown . The crown is life itself . God has promised it to those who love him .
59001013	When you are tempted , you shouldn't say , " God is tempting me . " God can't be tempted by evil . And he doesn't tempt anyone .
59001014	But your own evil longings tempt you . They lead you on and drag you away .
59001015	When they are allowed to grow , they give birth to sin . When sin has grown up , it gives birth to death .
59001016	My dear brothers and sisters , don't let anyone fool you .
59001017	Every good and perfect gift is from God . It comes down from the Father . He created the heavenly lights . He does not change like shadows that move .
59001018	God chose to give us new birth through the message of truth . He wanted us to be the first and best of everything he created .
59001019	My dear brothers and sisters , pay attention to what I say . Everyone should be quick to listen . But they should be slow to speak . They should be slow to get angry .
59001020	A man's anger doesn't produce the kind of life God wants .
59001021	So get rid of everything that is dirty and sinful . Get rid of the evil that is all around us . Don't be too proud to accept the word that is planted in you . It can save you .
59001022	Don't just listen to the word . You fool yourselves if you do that . You must do what it says .
59001023	Suppose you listen to the word but don't do what it says . Then you are like a man who looks at his face in a mirror .
59001024	After looking at himself , he leaves . Right away he forgets what he looks like .
59001025	But suppose you take a good look at the perfect law that gives freedom . You keep looking at it . You don't forget what you've heard , but you do what the law says . Then you will be blessed in what you do .
59001026	Suppose you think your beliefs are right because of how you live . But you don't control what you say . Then you are fooling yourselves . Your beliefs are not worth anything at all .
59001027	Here are the kinds of beliefs that God our Father accepts as pure and without fault . When widows and children who have no parents are in trouble , take care of them . And keep yourselves from being polluted by the world .
59002001	My brothers and sisters , you are believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ . So treat everyone the same .
59002002	Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes . And suppose a poor man in worn-out clothes also comes in .
59002003	Would you show special attention to the one who is wearing fine clothes ? Would you say , " Here's a good seat for you " ? Would you say to the poor person , " You stand there " ? Or " Sit on the floor by my feet " ?
59002004	If you would , aren't you treating some people better than others ? Aren't you like judges who have evil thoughts ?
59002005	My dear brothers and sisters , listen to me . Hasn't God chosen those who are poor in the world's eyes to be rich in faith ? Hasn't he chosen them to receive the kingdom ? Hasn't he promised it to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have put poor people down . Aren't rich people taking advantage of you ? Aren't they dragging you into court ?
59002007	Aren't they speaking evil things against the worthy name of Jesus ? Remember , you belong to him .
59002008	The royal law is found in Scripture . It says , " Love your neighbor as you love yourself . " If you really keep that law , you are doing what is right .
59002009	But you sin if you don't treat everyone the same . The law judges you because you have broken it .
59002010	Suppose you keep the whole law but trip over just one part of it . Then you are guilty of breaking all of it .
59002011	God said , " Do not commit adultery . " He also said , " Do not commit murder . " Suppose you don't commit adultery but do commit murder . Then you have broken the Law .
59002012	Speak and act like people who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom .
59002013	Those who have not shown mercy will not receive mercy when they are judged . To show mercy is better than to judge .
59002014	My brothers and sisters , what good is it if people claim they have faith but don't act like it ? Can that kind of faith save them ?
59002015	Suppose a brother or sister has no clothes or food .
59002016	Suppose one of you says to them , " Go . I hope everything turns out fine for you . Keep warm . Eat well . " And you do nothing about what they really need . Then what good have you done ?
59002017	It is the same with faith . If it doesn't cause us to do something , it's dead .
59002018	But someone will say , " You have faith . I do good works . " Show me your faith that doesn't do good works . And I will show you my faith by what I do .
59002019	You believe there is one God . Good ! Even the demons believe that . And they tremble !
59002020	You foolish man ! Do you want proof that faith without good works is useless ?
59002021	Our father Abraham offered his son Isaac on the altar . Wasn't he considered to be right with God because of what he did ?
59002022	So you see that what he believed and what he did were working together . What he did made his faith complete .
59002023	That is what Scripture means where it says , " Abraham believed God . God accepted Abraham because he believed . So his faith made him right with God . " And that's not all . God called Abraham his friend .
59002024	So you see that a person is made right with God by what he does . It doesn't happen only because of what he believes .
59002025	Didn't God make even Rahab the prostitute right with him ? That's because of what she did . She gave the spies a place to stay . Then she sent them off in a different direction .
59002026	The body without the spirit is dead . In the same way , faith without good works is dead .
59003001	My brothers and sisters , most of you shouldn't want to be teachers . You know that those of us who teach will be held more accountable .
59003002	All of us get tripped up in many ways . Suppose someone is never wrong in what he says . Then he is a perfect man . He is able to keep his whole body under control .
59003003	We put a bit in the mouth of a horse to make it obey us . We can control the whole animal with it .
59003004	And how about ships ? They are very big . They are driven along by strong winds . But they are steered by a very small rudder . It makes them go where the captain wants to go .
59003005	In the same way , the tongue is a small part of the body . But it brags a lot . Think about how a small spark can set a big forest on fire .
59003006	The tongue also is a fire . The tongue is the most evil part of the body . It pollutes the whole person . It sets a person's whole way of life on fire . And the tongue is set on fire by hell .
59003007	People have controlled all kinds of animals , birds , reptiles and creatures of the sea . They still control them .
59003008	But no one can control the tongue . It is an evil thing that never rests . It is full of deadly poison .
59003009	With our tongues we praise our Lord and Father . With our tongues we call down curses on people . We do it even though they have been created to be like God .
59003010	Praise and cursing come out of the same mouth . My brothers and sisters , it shouldn't be that way .
59003011	Can fresh water and salt water flow out of the same spring ?
59003012	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree bear olives ? Can a grapevine bear figs ? Of course not . And a saltwater spring can't produce fresh water either .
59003013	Are any of you wise and understanding ? You should show it by living a good life . Wise people aren't proud when they do good works .
59003014	But suppose your hearts are jealous and bitter . Suppose you are concerned only about getting ahead . Don't brag about it . Don't say no to the truth .
59003015	Wisdom like that doesn't come down from heaven . It belongs to the earth . It doesn't come from the Holy Spirit . It comes from the devil .
59003016	Are you jealous ? Are you concerned only about getting ahead ? Then your life will be a mess . You will be doing all kinds of evil things .
59003017	But the wisdom that comes from heaven is pure . That's the most important thing about it . And that's not all . It also loves peace . It thinks about others . It obeys . It is full of mercy and good fruit . It is fair . It doesn't pretend to be what it is not .
59003018	Those who make peace should plant peace like a seed . If they do , it will produce a crop of right living .
59004001	Why do you fight and argue among yourselves ? Isn't it because of your sinful longings ? They fight inside you .
59004002	You want something , but you can't get it . You kill and want what others have . But you can't have what you want . You argue and fight . You don't have what you want , because you don't ask God .
59004003	When you do ask for something , you don't receive it . Why ? Because you ask for the wrong reason . You want to spend your money on your sinful pleasures .
59004004	You are not faithful to God . Don't you know that to be a friend of the world is to hate God ? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God .
59004005	Don't you know what Scripture says ? The spirit that God caused to live in us wants us to belong only to God . Don't you think Scripture has a reason for saying that ?
59004006	God continues to give us more grace . That's why Scripture says , " God opposes those who are proud . But he gives grace to those who are not . "
59004007	So obey God . Stand up to the devil . He will run away from you .
59004008	Come near to God , and he will come near to you . Wash your hands , you sinners . Make your hearts pure , you who can't make up your minds .
59004009	Be full of sorrow . Cry and sob . Change your laughter to crying . Change your joy to sadness .
59004010	Bow down to the Lord . He will lift you up .
59004011	My brothers and sisters , don't speak against one another . Anyone who speaks against another believer speaks against the law . And anyone who judges another believer judges the law . When you judge the law , you are not keeping it . Instead , you are acting as if you were its judge .
59004012	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge . He is the One who is able to save life or destroy it . But who are you to judge your neighbor ?
59004013	Now listen , you who say , " Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city . We will spend a year there . We will buy and sell and make money . "
59004014	You don't even know what will happen tomorrow . What is your life ? It is a mist that appears for a little while . Then it disappears .
59004015	Instead , you should say , " If it pleases the Lord , we will live and do this or that . "
59004016	As it is , you are proud . You brag about it . That kind of bragging is evil .
59004017	So when you know the good things you should do and don't do them , you sin .
59005001	You rich people , listen to me . Cry and sob , because you will soon be suffering .
59005002	Your riches have rotted . Moths have eaten your clothes .
59005003	Your gold and silver have lost their brightness . Their dullness will give witness against you . Your wanting more and more will eat your body like fire . You have stored up riches in these last days .
59005004	You have even failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields . Their pay is crying out against you . The cries of those who gathered the harvest have reached the ears of the Lord who rules over all .
59005005	You have lived an easy life on earth . You have given yourselves everything you wanted . You have made yourselves fat like cattle that will soon be butchered .
59005006	You have judged and murdered people who aren't guilty . And they weren't even opposing you .
59005007	Brothers and sisters , be patient until the Lord comes . See how the farmer waits for the land to produce its rich crop . See how patient he is for the fall and spring rains .
59005008	You too must be patient . You must stand firm . The Lord will soon come back .
59005009	Brothers and sisters , don't find fault with one another . If you do , you will be judged . And the Judge is standing at the door !
59005010	Brothers and sisters , think about the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord . They are an example of how to be patient when you suffer .
59005011	As you know , we think that people who don't give up are blessed . You have heard that Job was patient . And you have seen what the Lord finally did for him . The Lord is full of tender mercy and loving concern .
59005012	My brothers and sisters , don't take an oath when you make a promise . Don't call on heaven or earth or anything else to back up what you say . Let your " Yes " be yes . And let your " No " be no . If you don't , you will be judged .
59005013	Are any of you in trouble ? Then you should pray . Are any of you happy ? Then sing songs of praise .
59005014	Are any of you sick ? Then send for the elders of the church to pray over you . Ask them to anoint you with oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	The prayer offered by those who have faith will make you well . The Lord will heal you . If you have sinned , you will be forgiven .
59005016	So admit to one another that you have sinned . Pray for one another so that you might be healed . The prayer of a godly person is powerful . It makes things happen .
59005017	Elijah was just like us . He prayed hard that it wouldn't rain . And it didn't rain on the land for three and a half years .
59005018	Then he prayed again . That time it rained . And the earth produced its crops .
59005019	My brothers and sisters , suppose one of you wanders away from the truth and someone brings you back .
59005020	Then here is what I want everyone to remember . Anyone who turns a sinner from going down the wrong path will save him from death . God will erase many sins by forgiving him .
60001001	I , Peter , am writing this letter . I am an apostle of Jesus Christ . I am sending this letter to you , God's chosen people . You are strangers in the world . You are scattered all over Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia and Bithynia .
60001002	You have been chosen in keeping with what God the Father had planned . That happened through the Spirit's work to make you pure and holy . God chose you so that you might obey Jesus Christ . He wanted you to be made clean by the blood of Christ . May more and more grace and peace be given to you .
60001003	Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . In his great mercy he has given us a new birth and a hope that is alive . It is alive because Jesus Christ rose from the dead .
60001004	He has given us new birth so that we might share in what belongs to him . It is a gift that can never be destroyed . It can never spoil or even fade away . It is kept in heaven for you .
60001005	Through faith you are kept safe by God's power . Your salvation is going to be completed . It is ready to be shown to you in the last days .
60001006	Because you know this , you have great joy . You have joy even though you may have had to suffer for a little while . You may have had to suffer sadness in all kinds of trouble .
60001007	Your troubles have come in order to prove that your faith is real . It is worth more than gold . Gold can pass away even though fire has made it pure . Your faith is meant to bring praise , honor and glory to God . That will happen when Jesus Christ returns .
60001008	Even though you have not seen him , you love him . Though you do not see him now , you believe in him . You are filled with a glorious joy that can't be put into words .
60001009	You are receiving the salvation of your souls . It is the result of your faith .
60001010	The prophets searched very hard and with great care to find out about that salvation . They spoke about the grace that was going to come to you .
60001011	They wanted to find out when that salvation would come . The Spirit of Christ in them was telling them about the sufferings of Christ that were going to come . He was also telling them about the glory that would follow .
60001012	It was made known to the prophets that they were not serving themselves . Instead , they were serving you when they spoke about the things that you have now heard . Those who have preached the good news to you have told you those things . They have done it with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Even angels long to look into those things .
60001013	So prepare your minds for action . Control yourselves . Put your hope completely in the grace that will be given to you when Jesus Christ returns .
60001014	You should obey . You shouldn't give in to evil longings . They controlled your life when you didn't know any better .
60001015	The one who chose you is holy . So you should be holy in all that you do .
60001016	It is written , " Be holy , because I am holy . "
60001017	You call on a Father who judges each person's work without favoring one over another . So live your lives as strangers here . Have the highest respect for God .
60001018	The blood of Christ set you free from an empty way of life . That way of life was handed down to you by your own people long ago . You know that you were not bought with things that can pass away , like silver or gold .
60001019	Instead , you were bought by the priceless blood of Christ . He is a perfect lamb . He doesn't have any flaws at all .
60001020	He was chosen before God created the world . But he came into the world in these last days for you .
60001021	Because of what Christ has done , you believe in God . It was God who raised him from the dead . And it was God who gave him glory . So your faith and hope are in God .
60001022	You have made yourselves pure by obeying the truth . So you have an honest and true love for your brothers and sisters . Love each other deeply , from the heart .
60001023	You have been born again by means of the living word of God . His word lasts forever . You were not born again from a seed that will die . You were born from a seed that can't die .
60001024	It is written , " All people are like grass . All of their glory is like the flowers in the field . The grass dries up . The flowers fall to the ground .
60001025	But the word of the Lord stands forever . " And that word was preached to you .
60002001	So get rid of every kind of evil . Stop telling lies . Don't pretend to be something you are not . Stop wanting what others have . Don't speak against each other .
60002002	Like babies that were just born , you should long for the pure milk of God's word . It will help you grow up as believers .
60002003	You can do it now that you have tasted how good the Lord is .
60002004	Christ is the living Stone . People did not accept him . But God chose him . God places the highest value on him .
60002005	You also are like living stones . As you come to him you are being built into a house for worship . There you will be holy priests . You will offer spiritual sacrifices . God will accept them because of what Jesus Christ has done .
60002006	In Scripture it says , " Look ! I am placing a stone in Zion . It is a chosen and very valuable stone . It is the most important stone in the building . The one who trusts in him will never be put to shame . "
60002007	The stone is very valuable to you who believe . But to people who do not believe , " The stone the builders did not accept has become the most important stone of all . "
60002008	And , " It is a stone that causes people to trip . It is a rock that makes them fall . " They trip and fall because they do not obey the message . That is also what God planned for them .
60002009	But God chose you to be his people . You are royal priests . You are a holy nation . You are a people who belong to God . All of this is so that you can sing his praises . He brought you out of darkness into his wonderful light .
60002010	Once you were not a people . But now you are the people of God . Once you had not received mercy . But now you have received mercy .
60002011	Dear friends , you are outsiders and strangers in this world . So I'm asking you not to give in to your sinful longings . They fight against your soul .
60002012	People who don't believe might say you are doing wrong . But lead good lives among them . Then they will see your good works . And they will give glory to God on the day he comes to judge .
60002013	Follow the lead of every human authority . Do it because the Lord wants you to . Obey the king . He is the highest authority .
60002014	Obey the governors . The king sends them to punish those who do wrong . He also sends them to praise those who do right .
60002015	By doing good you will put a stop to the talk of foolish people . They don't know what they are saying . God wants you to stop them .
60002016	Live like free people . But don't use your freedom to cover up evil . Live like people who serve God .
60002017	Show proper respect to everyone . Love the community of believers . Have respect for God . Honor the king .
60002018	Slaves , obey your masters with all the respect you should give them . Obey not only those who are good and kind . Obey also those who are not kind .
60002019	Suppose a person suffers pain unfairly because he wants to obey God . That is worthy of praise .
60002020	But suppose you receive a beating for doing wrong , and you put up with it . Will anyone honor you for that ? Of course not . But suppose you suffer for doing good , and you put up with it . God will praise you for that .
60002021	Christ suffered for you . He left you an example . He expects you to follow in his steps . You too were chosen to suffer .
60002022	Scripture says , " He didn't commit any sin . No lies ever came out of his mouth . "
60002023	People shouted at him and made fun of him . But he didn't do the same back to them . He suffered . But he didn't say that bad things would happen to them . Instead , he trusted in the One who judges fairly .
60002024	He himself carried our sins in his body on the cross . He did it so that we would die as far as sins are concerned . Then we would lead godly lives . His wounds have made you whole .
60002025	You were like sheep who were wandering away . But now you have returned to the Shepherd . He is the Leader of your souls .
60003001	Wives , follow the lead of your husbands . Suppose some of them don't believe God's word . Then let them be won to Christ without words by seeing how their wives behave .
60003002	Let them see how pure you are . Let them see that your lives are full of respect for God .
60003003	Braiding your hair doesn't make you beautiful . Wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes doesn't make you beautiful .
60003004	Instead , your beauty comes from inside you . It is the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit . Beauty like that doesn't fade away . God places great value on it .
60003005	This is how the holy women of the past used to make themselves beautiful . They put their hope in God . And they followed the lead of their own husbands .
60003006	Sarah was like that . She obeyed Abraham . She called him her master . Do you want to be like her ? Then do what is right . And don't give in to fear .
60003007	Husbands , take good care of your wives . They are weaker than you . So treat them with respect . Honor them as those who will share with you the gracious gift of life . Then nothing will stand in the way of your prayers .
60003008	Finally , I want all of you to live together in peace . Be understanding . Love one another like members of the same family . Be kind and tender . Don't be proud .
60003009	Don't pay back evil with evil . Don't pay back unkind words with unkind words . Instead , pay them back with kind words . That's what you have been chosen to do . You can receive a blessing by doing it .
60003010	Scripture says , " Do you want to love life and see good days ? Then keep your tongues from speaking evil . Keep your lips from telling lies .
60003011	Turn away from evil , and do good . Look for peace , and go after it .
60003012	The Lord's eyes look with favor on those who are godly . His ears are open to their prayers . But the Lord doesn't look with favor on those who do evil . "
60003013	Who is going to hurt you if you really want to do good ?
60003014	But suppose you suffer for doing what is right . Then you will be blessed . Scripture also says , " Don't fear what others fear . Don't be afraid . "
60003015	But make sure in your hearts that Christ is Lord . Always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks you about the hope you have . Be ready to give the reason for it . But do it gently and with respect .
60003016	Live so that you don't have to feel you've done anything wrong . Some people may say evil things about your good conduct as believers in Christ . If they do , they will be put to shame for speaking like that about you .
60003017	It is better to suffer for doing good than for doing evil if that's what God wants .
60003018	Christ died for sins once and for all time . The One who did what is right died for those who don't do right . He died to bring you to God . His body was put to death . But the Holy Spirit brought him back to life .
60003019	By means of the Spirit , Christ went and preached to the spirits in prison .
60003020	Long ago they did not obey . God was patient while Noah was building the ark . He waited , but only a few people went into the ark . A total of eight were saved by means of water .
60003021	The water of the flood is a picture of the baptism that now saves you also . The baptism I'm talking about has nothing to do with removing dirt from your body . Instead , it promises God that you will keep a clear sense of what is right and wrong . Jesus Christ has saved you by rising from the dead .
60003022	He has gone into heaven . He is at God's right hand . Angels , authorities and powers are under his control .
60004001	Christ suffered in his body . So get ready as a soldier does . Prepare yourselves to think in the same way Christ did . Do it because those who have suffered in their bodies are finished with sin .
60004002	As a result , they don't live the rest of their lives on earth controlled by evil human longings . Instead , they live to do what God wants .
60004003	You have spent enough time in the past doing what ungodly people choose to do . You lived a wild life . You longed for evil things . You got drunk . You went to wild parties . You worshiped statues of gods . The Lord hates that .
60004004	Ungodly people think that it's strange when you no longer join them in what they do . They want you to rush into the same flood of wasteful living . So they say bad things about you .
60004005	But they will have to explain their actions to God . He is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	That's why the good news was preached even to people who are now dead . Human judges said they were guilty as far as their bodies were concerned . But God set their spirits free to live as he wanted them to .
60004007	The end of all things is near . So keep a clear mind . Control yourselves . Then you can pray .
60004008	Most of all , love one another deeply . Love erases many sins by forgiving them .
60004009	Welcome others into your homes without complaining .
60004010	God's gifts of grace come in many forms . Each of you has received a gift in order to serve others . You should use it faithfully .
60004011	If you speak , you should do it like one speaking God's very words . If you serve , you should do it with the strength God provides . Then in all things God will be praised through Jesus Christ . Give him the glory and the power for ever and ever . Amen .
60004012	Dear friends , don't be surprised by the painful suffering you are going through . Don't feel as if something strange were happening to you .
60004013	Be joyful that you are taking part in Christ's sufferings . Then you will be filled with joy when Christ returns in glory .
60004014	Suppose people make fun of you because you believe in Christ . Then you are blessed , because God's Spirit rests on you . He is the Spirit of glory .
60004015	Suppose you suffer . Then it shouldn't be because you are a murderer or a thief . It shouldn't be because you do evil things . It shouldn't be because you poke your nose into other people's business .
60004016	But suppose you suffer for being a Christian . Then don't be ashamed . Instead , praise God because you are known by that name .
60004017	It is time for people to be judged . It will begin with the family of God . And since it begins with us , what will happen to people who don't obey God's good news ?
60004018	Scripture says , " Suppose it is hard for godly people to be saved . Then what will happen to ungodly people and sinners ? "
60004019	Some people will suffer because God has planned it that way . They should commit themselves to their faithful Creator . And they should continue to do good .
60005001	I'm speaking to the elders among you . I was a witness of Christ's sufferings . And I will also share in the glory that is going to come . I'm making my appeal to you as one who is an elder together with you .
60005002	Be shepherds of God's flock , the believers who are under your care . Serve as their leaders . Don't serve them because you have to . Instead , do it because you want to . That's what God wants you to do . Don't do it because you want to get more and more money . Do it because you really want to serve .
60005003	Don't act as if you were a ruler over those who are under your care . Instead , be examples to the flock .
60005004	The Chief Shepherd will come again . Then you will receive the crown of glory . It is a crown that will never fade away .
60005005	Young men , follow the lead of those who are older . All of you , put on a spirit that is free of pride toward each other as if it were your clothes . Scripture says , " God opposes those who are proud . But he gives grace to those who are not . "
60005006	So don't be proud . Put yourselves under God's mighty hand . Then he will honor you at the right time .
60005007	Turn all your worries over to him . He cares about you .
60005008	Control yourselves . Be on your guard . Your enemy the devil is like a roaring lion . He prowls around looking for someone to chew up and swallow .
60005009	Stand up to him . Stand firm in what you believe . All over the world you know that your brothers and sisters are going through the same kind of suffering .
60005010	God always gives you all the grace you need . So you will only have to suffer for a little while . Then God himself will build you up again . He will make you strong and steady . And he has chosen you to share in his eternal glory because you belong to Christ .
60005011	Give him the power for ever and ever . Amen .
60005012	I consider Silas to be a faithful brother . With his help I have written you this short letter . I have written it to cheer you up . And I have written to give witness about the true grace of God . Stand firm in it .
60005013	The members of the church in Babylon send you their greetings . They were chosen together with you . Mark , my son in the faith , also sends you his greetings .
60005014	Greet each other with a friendly kiss . May God give peace to all of you who believe in Christ .
61001001	I , Simon Peter , am writing this letter . I serve Jesus Christ . I am his apostle . I am sending this letter to you who have received a faith as valuable as ours . You received it because our God and Savior Jesus Christ does what is right and fair for everyone .
61001002	May more and more grace and peace be given to you . May they come to you as you learn more about God and about Jesus our Lord .
61001003	God's power has given us everything we need to lead a godly life . All of that has come to us because we know the One who chose us . He chose us because of his own glory and goodness .
61001004	He has also given us his very great and valuable promises . He did it so you could share in his nature . He also did it so you could escape from the evil in the world . That evil is caused by sinful longings .
61001005	So you should try very hard to add goodness to your faith . To goodness , add knowledge .
61001006	To knowledge , add the ability to control yourselves . To the ability to control yourselves , add the strength to keep going . To the strength to keep going , add godliness .
61001007	To godliness , add kindness to believers . And to kindness to believers , add love .
61001008	You should possess more and more of those good points . They will make you useful and fruitful as you get to know our Lord Jesus Christ better .
61001009	But what if some of you do not have those good points ? Then you can't see very well . You are blind . You have forgotten that your past sins have been washed away .
61001010	My brothers and sisters , be very sure that God has appointed you to be saved . Be sure that he has chosen you . If you do everything I have just said , you will never trip and fall .
61001011	You will receive a rich welcome into the kingdom that lasts forever . It is the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	So I will always remind you of these things . I'll do it even though you know them . I'll do it even though you now have deep roots in the truth .
61001013	I think it is right for me to remind you . It is right as long as I live in this tent . I'm talking about my body .
61001014	I know my tent will soon be removed . Our Lord Jesus Christ has made that clear to me .
61001015	I hope that you will always be able to remember these things after I'm gone . I will try very hard to see that you do .
61001016	We told you about the time our Lord Jesus Christ came with power . But we didn't make up stories when we told you about it . With our own eyes we saw him in all his majesty .
61001017	God the Father gave him honor and glory . The voice of the Majestic Glory came to him . It said , " This is my Son , and I love him . I am very pleased with him . "
61001018	We ourselves heard the voice that came from heaven . We were with him on the sacred mountain .
61001019	The word of the prophets is made more certain . We have that word . You must pay attention to it . It is like a light shining in a dark place . It will shine until the day Jesus comes . Then the Morning Star will rise in your hearts .
61001020	Above all , here is what you must understand . No prophecy in Scripture ever came from a prophet's own understanding .
61001021	It never came simply because a prophet wanted it to . Instead , the Holy Spirit guided the prophets as they spoke . So prophecy comes from God .
61002001	But there were also false prophets among the people . In the same way there will be false teachers among you . In secret they will bring in teachings that will destroy you . They will even turn against the Lord and Master who died to save them . His death paid for their sins . They will quickly destroy themselves .
61002002	Many people will follow their shameful ways . They will give the way of truth a bad name .
61002003	Those teachers are never satisfied . They want to get something out of you . So they make up stories to take advantage of you . They have been under a sentence of death for a long time . The One who will destroy them has not been sleeping .
61002004	God did not spare angels when they sinned . Instead , he sent them to hell . He put them in dark prisons . He will keep them there until he judges them .
61002005	God did not spare the world's ungodly people long ago . He brought the flood on them . But Noah preached about the right way to live . God kept him safe . He also saved seven others .
61002006	God judged the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . He burned them to ashes . He made them an example of what is going to happen to ungodly people .
61002007	God saved Lot . He was a man who did what was right . He was shocked by the dirty , sinful lives of people who didn't obey God's laws .
61002008	That good man lived among them day after day . He saw and heard the evil things they were doing . They were breaking God's laws . And his godly spirit was deeply troubled .
61002009	So the Lord knows how to keep godly people safe in times of testing . He also knows how to keep ungodly people under guard until the day they will be judged . In the meantime , he continues to punish them .
61002010	Most of all , this is true of people who follow the evil longings of their sinful natures . They hate to be under authority . Those false prophets are bold and proud . They aren't afraid to speak evil things against heavenly beings .
61002011	Angels are stronger and more powerful than those people . But even angels don't bring to the Lord evil charges against heavenly beings .
61002012	Those people speak evil about things they don't understand . They are like wild animals . They do what comes naturally to them . They are born only to be caught and destroyed . Just like animals , they too will die .
61002013	They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done . Their idea of pleasure is to have wild parties in the middle of the day . They are like spots and stains . They enjoy their sinful pleasures while they eat with you .
61002014	They stare at women who are not their wives . They want to have sex with them . They never stop sinning . They trap those who are not firm in their faith . They have mastered the art of getting what they want . God has placed them under his curse .
61002015	They have left God's way . They have wandered off . They follow the way of Balaam , son of Beor . He loved to get paid for doing his evil work .
61002016	But a donkey corrected him for the wrong he did . Animals don't speak . But the donkey spoke with a human voice . It tried to stop the prophet from doing a very dumb thing .
61002017	Those false prophets are like springs without water . They are like mists driven by a storm . The blackest darkness is reserved for them .
61002018	They speak empty , bragging words . They make their appeal to the earthly longings of people's sinful nature . They tempt new believers who are just escaping from the company of sinful people .
61002019	They promise to give freedom to the new believers . But they themselves are slaves to sinful living . A person is a slave to anything that controls him .
61002020	They may have escaped the sin of the world . They may have come to know our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . But what if they are once again caught up in sin ? And what if it has become their master ? Then they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning .
61002021	What if they had not known the way of godliness ? That would have been better than to have known it and then to have turned their backs on it . The way of godliness is the sacred command that was passed on to them .
61002022	What the proverbs say about them is true . " A dog returns to where it has thrown up . " And , " A pig that is washed goes back to rolling in the mud . "
61003001	Dear friends , this is now my second letter to you . I have written both of them as reminders . I want to stir you up to think in a way that is pure .
61003002	I want you to remember the words the holy prophets spoke in the past . Remember the command our Lord and Savior gave through your apostles .
61003003	First of all , here is what you must understand . In the last days people will make fun of the truth . They will laugh at it . They will follow their own evil longings .
61003004	They will say , " Where is this ' return ' he promised ? Everything goes on in the same way it has since our people of long ago died . In fact , it has continued that way since God first created everything . "
61003005	Long ago , God's word brought the heavens into being . His word separated the earth from the waters . And the waters surrounded it . But those people forget things like that on purpose .
61003006	The waters also flooded the world of that time . It was destroyed .
61003007	By God's word the heavens and earth of today are being reserved for fire . They are being kept for the day when God will judge . Then ungodly people will be destroyed .
61003008	Dear friends , here is one thing you must not forget . With the Lord a day is like a thousand years . And a thousand years are like a day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow to keep his promise . He is not slow in the way some people understand it . He is patient with you . He doesn't want anyone to be destroyed . Instead , he wants all people to turn away from their sins .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a roar . Fire will destroy everything in them . God will judge the earth and everything in it .
61003011	So everything will be destroyed . And what kind of people should you be ? You should lead holy and godly lives .
61003012	Live like that as you look forward to the day of God . It will make the day come more quickly . On that day fire will destroy the heavens . Its heat will melt everything in them .
61003013	But we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth . Godliness will make its home there . All of this is in keeping with God's promise .
61003014	Dear friends , I know you are looking forward to that . So try your best to be found pure and without blame . Be at peace with God .
61003015	Remember that while our Lord is waiting patiently to return , people are being saved . Our dear brother Paul also wrote to you about that . God made him wise to write as he did .
61003016	He writes the same way in all his letters . He speaks about what I have just told you . His letters include some things that are hard to understand . People who don't know better and aren't firm in the faith twist what he says . They twist the other Scriptures too . So they will be destroyed .
61003017	Dear friends , you already know that . So be on your guard . Then you won't be led down the wrong path by the mistakes of people who don't obey the law . You won't fall from your safe position .
61003018	Grow in the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . Get to know him better . Give him glory both now and forever . Amen .
62001001	Here is what we announce to everyone about the Word of life . He was already here from the beginning . We have heard him . We have seen him with our eyes . We have looked at him . Our hands have touched him .
62001002	That life has appeared . We have seen him . We give witness about him . And we announce to you that same eternal life . He was already with the Father . He has appeared to us .
62001003	We announce to you what we have seen and heard . We do it so you can share life together with us . And we share life with the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
62001004	We are writing this to make our joy complete .
62001005	Here is the message we have heard from him and announce to you . God is light . There is no darkness in him at all .
62001006	Suppose we say that we share life with God but still walk in the darkness . Then we are lying . We are not living by the truth .
62001007	But suppose we walk in the light , just as he is in the light . Then we share life with one another . And the blood of Jesus , his Son , makes us pure from all sin .
62001008	Suppose we claim we are without sin . Then we are fooling ourselves . The truth is not in us .
62001009	But God is faithful and fair . If we admit that we have sinned , he will forgive us our sins . He will forgive every wrong thing we have done . He will make us pure .
62001010	If we say we have not sinned , we are calling God a liar . His word has no place in our lives .
62002001	My dear children , I'm writing this to you so that you will not sin . But suppose someone does sin . Then we have one who speaks to the Father for us . He stands up for us . He is Jesus Christ , the Blameless One .
62002002	He gave his life to pay for our sins . But he not only paid for our sins . He also paid for the sins of the whole world .
62002003	We know that we have come to know God if we obey his commands .
62002004	Suppose someone says , " I know him . " But suppose that person does not do what God commands . Then that person is a liar and is not telling the truth .
62002005	But if anyone obeys God's word , then God's love is truly made complete in that person . Here is how we know we belong to him .
62002006	Those who claim to belong to him must live just as Jesus did .
62002007	Dear friends , I'm not writing you a new command . Instead , I'm writing one you have heard before . You have had it since the beginning .
62002008	But I am writing what amounts to a new command . Its truth was shown in how Jesus lived . It is also shown in how you live . The darkness is passing away . The true light is already shining .
62002009	Suppose someone claims to be in the light but hates his brother or sister . Then he is still in the darkness .
62002010	Those who love their brothers and sisters are living in the light . There is nothing in them to make them fall into sin .
62002011	But those who hate a brother or sister are in the darkness . They walk around in the darkness . They don't know where they are going . The darkness has made them blind .
62002012	Dear children , I'm writing to you because your sins have been forgiven . They have been forgiven because of what Jesus has done .
62002013	Fathers , I'm writing to you because you have known the One who is from the beginning . Young people , I'm writing to you because you have won the battle over the evil one . Dear children , I'm writing to you because you have known the Father .
62002014	Fathers , I'm writing to you because you have known the One who is from the beginning . Young people , I'm writing to you because you are strong . God's word lives in you . You have won the battle over the evil one .
62002015	Do not love the world or anything in it . If you love the world , love for the Father is not in you .
62002016	Here is what people who belong to this world do . They try to satisfy what their sinful natures want to do . They long for what their sinful eyes look at . They brag about what they have and what they do . All of this comes from the world . It doesn't come from the Father .
62002017	The world and its evil longings are passing away . But those who do what God wants them to do live forever .
62002018	Dear children , we are living in the last days . You have heard that the great enemy of Christ is coming . But even now many enemies of Christ have already come . That's how we know that these are the last days .
62002019	The enemies left our group . They didn't really belong to us . If they had belonged to us , they would have remained with us . But by leaving they showed that none of them belonged to us .
62002020	You have received the Spirit from the Holy One . And all of you know the truth .
62002021	I'm not writing to you because you don't know the truth but because you do know it . I'm writing to you because no lie comes from the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar ? The person who says that Jesus is not the Christ . People who say that are the enemies of Christ . They say no to the Father and the Son .
62002023	Those who say no to the Son don't belong to the Father . But anyone who says yes to the Son belongs to the Father also .
62002024	Make sure that you don't forget what you have heard from the beginning . Then you will remain joined to the Son and to the Father .
62002025	That's what God has promised us . We have eternal life .
62002026	I'm writing these things to warn you about those who are trying to lead you down the wrong path .
62002027	But you have received the Holy Spirit from God . He continues to live in you . So you don't need anyone to teach you . God's Spirit teaches you about everything . What he says is true . He doesn't lie . Remain joined to Christ , just as you have been taught by the Spirit .
62002028	Dear children , remain joined to Christ . Then when he comes , we can be bold . We will not be ashamed to meet him when he comes .
62002029	You know that God is right and always does what is right . And you know that everyone who does what is right has been born again because of what God has done .
62003001	How great is the love the Father has given us so freely ! Now we can be called children of God . And that's what we really are ! The world doesn't know us because it didn't know him .
62003002	Dear friends , now we are children of God . He still hasn't let us know what we will be . But we know that when Christ appears , we will be like him . We will see him as he really is .
62003003	He is pure . All who hope to be like him make themselves pure .
62003004	Everyone who sins breaks the law . In fact , breaking the law is sin .
62003005	But you know that Christ came to take our sins away . And there is no sin in him .
62003006	No one who remains joined to him keeps on sinning . No one who keeps on sinning has seen him or known him .
62003007	Dear children , don't let anyone lead you down the wrong path . Those who do what is right are holy , just as Christ is holy .
62003008	Those who do what is sinful belong to the devil . They are just like him . He has been sinning from the beginning . But the Son of God came to destroy the devil's work .
62003009	Those who are born again because of what God has done will not keep on sinning . God's very nature remains in them . They can't go on sinning . They have been born again because of what God has done .
62003010	Here is how you can tell the difference between the children of God and the children of the devil . Those who don't do what is right do not belong to God . Those who don't love their brothers and sisters do not belong to him either .
62003011	From the beginning we have heard that we should love one another .
62003012	Don't be like Cain . He belonged to the evil one . He murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because the things Cain had done were wrong . But the things his brother had done were right .
62003013	My brothers and sisters , don't be surprised if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have left our old dead condition and entered into new life . We know it because we love one another . Those who do not are still living in their old condition .
62003015	Those who hate their brothers and sisters are murderers . And you know that murderers do not have eternal life in their hearts .
62003016	We know what love is because Jesus Christ gave his life for us . So we should give our lives for our brothers and sisters .
62003017	Suppose someone sees a brother or sister in need and is able to help them . If he doesn't take pity on them , how can the love of God be in him ?
62003018	Dear children , don't just talk about love . Put your love into action . Then it will truly be love .
62003019	That's how we know that we hold to the truth . And that's how we put our hearts at rest , knowing that God is watching .
62003020	Our hearts may judge us . But God is greater than our hearts . He knows everything .
62003021	Dear friends , if our hearts do not judge us , we can be bold with God .
62003022	And he will give us anything we ask . That's because we obey his commands . We do what pleases him .
62003023	God has commanded us to believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ . He has also commanded us to love one another .
62003024	Those who obey his commands remain joined to him . And he remains joined to them . How do we know that God lives in us ? We know it because of the Holy Spirit he gave us .
62004001	Dear friends , do not believe every spirit . Put the spirits to the test to see if they belong to God . Many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	How can you recognize the Spirit of God ? Every spirit that agrees that Jesus Christ came in a human body belongs to God .
62004003	But every spirit that doesn't agree with this does not belong to God . It is the spirit of the great enemy of Christ . You have heard that the enemy is coming . Even now he is already in the world .
62004004	Dear children , you belong to God . You have not accepted the teachings of the false prophets . That's because the One who is in you is more powerful than the one who is in the world .
62004005	False prophets belong to the world . So they speak from the world's point of view . The world listens to them .
62004006	We belong to God . And those who know God listen to us . But those who don't belong to God don't listen to us . That's how we can tell the difference between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of lies .
62004007	Dear friends , let us love one another , because love comes from God . Everyone who loves has been born again because of what God has done . That person knows God .
62004008	Anyone who does not love does not know God , because God is love .
62004009	How did God show his love for us ? He sent his one and only Son into the world . He sent him so we could receive life through him .
62004010	What is love ? It is not that we loved God . It is that he loved us and sent his Son to give his life to pay for our sins .
62004011	Dear friends , since God loved us that much , we should also love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God . But if we love one another , God lives in us . His love is made complete in us .
62004013	We know that we belong to him and he belongs to us . He has given us his Holy Spirit .
62004014	The Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world . We have seen it . We give witness to it .
62004015	God lives in anyone who agrees that Jesus is the Son of God . That kind of person remains joined to God .
62004016	So we know that God loves us . We depend on it . God is love . Anyone who leads a life of love shows that he is joined to God . And God is joined to him .
62004017	So love is made complete among us . We will be bold on the day God judges us . That's because in this world we love as Jesus did .
62004018	There is no fear in love . Instead , perfect love drives fear away . Fear has to do with being punished . The one who fears does not have perfect love .
62004019	We love because he loved us first .
62004020	Anyone who says he loves God but in fact hates his brother or sister is a liar . He doesn't love his brother or sister , whom he has seen . So he can't love God , whom he has not seen .
62004021	Here is the command God has given us . Anyone who loves God must also love his brothers and sisters .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born again because of what God has done . And everyone who loves the Father loves his children as well .
62005002	How do we know that we love God's children ? We know it when we love God and obey his commands .
62005003	Here is what it means to love God . It means that we obey his commands . And his commands are not hard to obey .
62005004	That's because everyone who is a child of God has won the battle over the world . Our faith has won the battle for us .
62005005	Who is it that has won the battle over the world ? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God .
62005006	Jesus Christ is the one who was baptized in water and died on the cross . He wasn't just baptized in water . He also died on the cross . The Holy Spirit has given a truthful witness about him . That's because the Spirit is the truth .
62005007	There are three that give witness about Jesus .
62005008	They are the Holy Spirit , the baptism of Jesus and his death . And the three of them agree .
62005009	We accept the witness of people . But the witness of God is more important because it is God who gives it . He has given witness about his Son .
62005010	Those who believe in the Son of God have accepted that witness in their hearts . Those who do not believe God's witness are calling him a liar . That's because they have not believed his witness about his Son .
62005011	Here is God's witness . He has given us eternal life . That life is found in his Son .
62005012	Those who belong to the Son have life . Those who do not belong to the Son of God do not have life .
62005013	I'm writing these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God . I'm doing it so you will know that you have eternal life .
62005014	There is one thing we can be sure of when we come to God in prayer . If we ask anything in keeping with what he wants , he hears us .
62005015	If we know that God hears what we ask for , we know that we have it .
62005016	Suppose you see your brother or sister commit a sin . But that sin is not the kind that leads to death . Then you should pray for them . And God will give life to them . I'm talking about someone whose sin does not lead to death . But there is a sin that does lead to death . I'm not saying that you should pray about that .
62005017	Every wrong thing we do is sin . But there are sins that do not lead to death .
62005018	We know that those who are children of God do not keep on sinning . The Son of God keeps them safe . The evil one can't harm them .
62005019	We know that we are children of God . We know that the whole world is under the control of the evil one .
62005020	We also know that the Son of God has come . He has given us understanding . Now we can know the One who is true . And we belong to the One who is true . We also belong to his Son , Jesus Christ . He is the true God . He is eternal life .
62005021	Dear children , keep away from statues of gods .
63001001	I , the elder , am writing this letter . I am sending it to the chosen lady and her children . I love all of you because of the truth . I'm not the only one who loves you . So does everyone who knows the truth .
63001002	I love you because of the truth that is alive in us . That truth will be with us forever .
63001003	God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son will give you grace , mercy and peace . Those blessings will be with us because we love the truth .
63001004	It has given me great joy to find some of your children living by the truth . That's just what the Father commanded us to do .
63001005	Dear lady , I'm not writing you a new command . I'm writing a command we've had from the beginning . I'm asking that we love one another .
63001006	The way we show our love is to obey God's commands . He commands you to lead a life of love . That's what you have heard from the beginning .
63001007	Many people who try to fool others have gone out into the world . They don't agree that Jesus Christ came in a human body . People like that try to trick others . They are enemies of Christ .
63001008	Watch out that you don't lose what you have worked for . Make sure that you get your complete reward .
63001009	Some people run ahead of others . They don't follow the teaching of Christ . People like that don't belong to God . But those who follow the teaching of Christ belong to the Father and the Son .
63001010	Suppose someone comes to you and doesn't teach these truths . Then don't take him into your house . Don't welcome him .
63001011	Anyone who welcomes him shares in his evil work .
63001012	I have a lot to write to you . But I don't want to use paper and ink . Instead , I hope I can visit you . Then I can talk with you face to face . That will make our joy complete .
63001013	The children of your chosen sister send their greetings .
64001001	I , the elder , am writing this letter . I am sending it to you , my dear friend Gaius . I love you because of the truth .
64001002	Dear friend , I know that your spiritual life is going well . I pray that you also may enjoy good health . And I pray that everything else may go well with you .
64001003	Some believers came to me and told me that you are faithful to the truth . They told me that you continue to live by it . That gave me great joy .
64001004	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are living by the truth .
64001005	Dear friend , you are faithful in what you are doing for the believers . You are faithful even though they are strangers to you .
64001006	They have told the church about your love . Please help them by sending them on their way in a manner that honors God .
64001007	They started on their journey to serve Jesus Christ . They didn't receive any help from those who aren't believers .
64001008	So we should welcome people like them . We should work together with them for the truth .
64001009	I wrote to the church . But Diotrephes won't have anything to do with us . He loves to be the first in everything .
64001010	So if I come , I will point out what he is doing . He is saying evil things about us to others . Even that doesn't satisfy him . He refuses to welcome other believers . He also keeps others from welcoming them . In fact , he throws them out of the church .
64001011	Dear friend , don't be like those who do evil . Be like those who do good . Anyone who does what is good belongs to God . Anyone who does what is evil hasn't really seen or known God .
64001012	Everyone says good things about Demetrius . He lives in keeping with the truth . We also say good things about him . And you know that our witness is true .
64001013	I have a lot to write to you . But I don't want to write with pen and ink .
64001014	I hope I can see you soon . Then we can talk face to face . May you have peace . The friends here send their greetings . Greet the friends there by name .
64001015	
65001001	I , Jude , am writing this letter . I serve Jesus Christ . I am a brother of James . I am sending this letter to you who have been chosen by God . You are loved by God the Father . You are kept safe by Jesus Christ .
65001002	May more and more mercy , peace , and love be given to you .
65001003	Dear friends , I really wanted to write to you about the salvation we share . But now I feel I should write and ask you to stand up for the faith . God's people were trusted with it once and for all time .
65001004	Certain people have slipped in among you in secret . Long ago it was written that they would be judged . They are godless people . They use the grace of our God as an excuse for sexual sins . They say no to Jesus Christ . He is our only Lord and King .
65001005	I want to remind you about some things you already know . The Lord saved his people . He brought them out of Egypt . But later he destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	Some of the angels didn't stay where they belonged . They didn't keep their positions of authority . The Lord has kept those angels in darkness . They are held by chains that last forever . On judgment day , God will judge them .
65001007	The people of Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them also did evil things . They gave themselves over to sexual sins . They committed sins of the worst possible kind . They are an example of those who are punished with fire . The fire never goes out .
65001008	In the very same way , those dreamers pollute their own bodies . They don't accept authority . They speak evil things against heavenly beings .
65001009	But not even Michael did that . He was the leader of the angels . He argued with the devil about the body of Moses . But he didn't dare to speak evil things against the devil . Instead , he said , " May the Lord stop you ! "
65001010	But those people speak evil things against what they don't understand . They are like wild animals . They can't think for themselves . They do what comes naturally to them . Those are the very things that destroy them .
65001011	How terrible it will be for them ! They followed the way of Cain . They rushed ahead and made the same mistake as Balaam did . They did it because they loved money . They are like Korah . He turned against his leaders . Those people will certainly be destroyed , just as Korah was .
65001012	They are like stains at the meals you share . They eat too much . They have no shame . They are shepherds who feed only themselves . They are like clouds without rain . They are blown along by the wind . They are like trees in the fall . Since they have no fruit , they are pulled up . So they die twice .
65001013	They are like wild waves of the sea . Their shame rises up like foam . They are like falling stars . God has reserved a place of very black darkness for them . He will keep them there forever .
65001014	Enoch was the seventh man in the family line of Adam . He gave a prophecy about those people . He said , " Look ! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy ones .
65001015	He is coming to judge everyone . He is coming to sentence all ungodly people . He will judge them for all the ungodly acts they have done . They have done them in ungodly ways . He will sentence ungodly sinners for all the bad things they have said about him . "
65001016	Those people complain . They find fault with others . They follow their own evil longings . They brag about themselves . They praise others to help themselves .
65001017	Dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said was going to happen .
65001018	They told you , " In the last days , some people will make fun of the truth . They will follow their own ungodly longings . "
65001019	They are the people who separate you from one another . They do only what comes naturally . They are not led by the Holy Spirit .
65001020	Dear friends , build yourselves up in your most holy faith . Let the Holy Spirit guide and help you when you pray .
65001021	The mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ will bring you eternal life . As you wait for his mercy , remain in God's love .
65001022	Show mercy to those who doubt .
65001023	Pull others out of the fire . Save them . To others , show mercy mixed with fear . Hate even the clothes that are stained by the sins of those who wear them .
65001024	Give praise to the One who is able to keep you from falling into sin . He will bring you into his heavenly glory without any fault . He will bring you there with great joy .
65001025	Give praise to the only God . He is our Savior . Glory , majesty , power and authority belong to him . Give praise to him through Jesus Christ our Lord . Give praise to the One who was before all time , who now is , and who will be forever . Amen .
66001001	This is the revelation that God gave to Jesus Christ . Jesus shows those who serve God what will happen soon . God made it known by sending his angel to his servant John .
66001002	John gives witness to everything he saw . The things he gives witness to are God's word and what Jesus Christ has said .
66001003	Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy . Blessed are those who hear it and think everything it says is important . The time when these things will come true is near .
66001004	I , John , am writing this letter . I am sending it to the seven churches in Asia Minor . May grace and peace come to you from the One who is , and who was , and who will come . May grace and peace come to you from the seven spirits who are in front of God's throne .
66001005	May grace and peace come to you from Jesus Christ . What Jesus gives witness to can always be trusted . He was the first to rise from the dead . He rules over the kings of the earth . Give glory and power to the One who loves us ! He has set us free from our sins by pouring out his blood for us .
66001006	He has made us members of his royal family . He has made us priests who serve his God and Father . Give him glory and power for ever and ever ! Amen .
66001007	Look ! He is coming with the clouds ! Every eye will see him . Even those who pierced him will see him . All the nations of the earth will be sad because of him . This will really happen ! Amen .
66001008	" I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , " says the Lord God . " I am the One who is , and who was , and who will come . I am the Mighty One . "
66001009	I , John , am a believer like you . I am a friend who suffers like you . As members of Jesus' royal family , we can put up with anything that happens to us . I was on the island of Patmos because I taught God's word and what Jesus said .
66001010	The Holy Spirit took complete control of me on the Lord's Day . I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet .
66001011	The voice said , " Write on a scroll what you see . Send it to the seven churches in Asia Minor . They are Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia and Laodicea . "
66001012	I turned around to see who was speaking to me . When I turned , I saw seven golden lampstands .
66001013	In the middle of them was someone who looked " like a son of man . " He was dressed in a long robe with a gold strip of cloth around his chest .
66001014	The hair on his head was white like wool , as white as snow . His eyes were like a blazing fire .
66001015	His feet were like bronze metal glowing in a furnace . His voice sounded like rushing waters .
66001016	He held seven stars in his right hand . Out of his mouth came a sharp sword that had two edges . His face was like the sun shining in all of its brightness .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell at his feet as if I were dead . Then he put his right hand on me and said , " Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
66001018	I am the Living One . I was dead . But look ! I am alive for ever and ever ! And I hold the keys to Death and Hell .
66001019	" So write down what you have seen . Write about what is happening now and what will happen later .
66001020	Here is what the mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand means . They are the angels of the seven churches . And the seven golden lampstands you saw stand for the seven churches .
66002001	" Here is what I command you to write to the church in Ephesus . Here are the words of the One who holds the seven stars in his right hand . He also walks among the seven golden lampstands . He says ,
66002002	' I know what you are doing . You work long and hard . I know you can't put up with those who are evil . You have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not . You have found out that they are liars .
66002003	You have been faithful and have put up with a lot of trouble because of me . You have not given up .
66002004	' But here is something I hold against you . You don't have as much love as you had at first .
66002005	Remember how far you have fallen ! Turn away from your sins . Do the things you did at first . If you don't , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place .
66002006	' But you do have this in your favor . You hate the way the Nicolaitans act . I hate it too .
66002007	' Those who have ears should listen to what the Holy Spirit says to the churches . I will allow those who overcome to eat from the tree of life in God's paradise . '
66002008	" Here is what I command you to write to the church in Smyrna . Here are the words of the One who is the First and the Last . He is the One who died and came to life again . He says ,
66002009	' I know that you suffer and are poor . But you are rich ! Some people say they are Jews but are not . I know that their words are evil . Their worship is satanic .
66002010	' Don't be afraid of what you are going to suffer . I tell you , the devil will put some of you in prison to test you . You will be treated badly for ten days . Be faithful , even if it means you must die . Then I will give you a crown . The crown is life itself .
66002011	' Those who have ears should listen to what the Holy Spirit says to the churches . Those who overcome will not be hurt at all by the second death . '
66002012	" Here is what I command you to write to the church in Pergamum . Here are the words of the One with the sharp sword that has two edges . He says ,
66002013	' I know that you live where Satan has his throne . But you remain true to me . You did not give up your faith in me , even in the days of Antipas , my faithful witness . He was put to death in your city , where Satan lives .
66002014	' But I have a few things against you . You have people there who follow the teaching of Balaam . He taught Balak to lead the people of Israel into sin . So they ate food that had been offered to statues of gods . And they committed sexual sins .
66002015	You also have people who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	' So turn away from your sins ! If you don't , I will come to you soon . I will fight against those people with the sword that comes out of my mouth .
66002017	' Those who have ears should listen to what the Holy Spirit says to the churches . I will give hidden manna to those who overcome . I will also give each of them a white stone with a new name written on it . Only the one who receives that name will know what it is . '
66002018	" Here is what I command you to write to the church in Thyatira . Here are the words of the Son of God . He is the One whose eyes are like blazing fire . His feet are like polished bronze . He says ,
66002019	' I know what you are doing . I know your love and your faith . I know how well you have served . I know you don't give up easily . In fact , you are doing more now than you did at first .
66002020	' But here is what I have against you . You put up with that woman Jezebel . She calls herself a prophet . With her teaching , she has led my servants into sexual sin . She has tricked them into eating food offered to statues of gods .
66002021	' I've given her time to turn away from her sinful ways . But she doesn't want to .
66002022	She sinned on a bed . So I will make her suffer on a bed . And those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly . Their only way out is to turn away from what she taught them to do .
66002023	I will strike her children dead . Then all the churches will know that I am the One who searches hearts and minds . I will pay each of you back for what you have done .
66002024	' I won't bother the rest of you in Thyatira . You don't follow the teaching of Jezebel . You haven't learned what some people call Satan's deep secrets .
66002025	Just hold on to what you have until I come .
66002026	' I'll give authority over the nations to all who overcome and who carry out my plans to the end .
66002027	It is written , ' ' " He will rule them with an iron rod . He will break them to pieces like clay pots . " I have received this authority from my Father .
66002028	I will also give the morning star to all who overcome .
66002029	' Those who have ears should listen to what the Holy Spirit says to the churches . '
66003001	" Here is what I command you to write to the church in Sardis . Here are the words of the One who holds the seven spirits of God . He has the seven stars in his hand . He says , ' I know what you are doing . People think you are alive , but you are dead .
66003002	Wake up ! Strengthen what is left , or it will die . You have not done all that my God wants you to do .
66003003	' So remember what you have been taught and have heard . Obey it . Turn away from your sins . If you don't wake up , I will come like a thief . You won't know when I will come to you .
66003004	' But you have a few people in Sardis who have kept their clothes clean . They will walk with me , dressed in white , because they are worthy .
66003005	Those who overcome will also be dressed in white . I will never erase their names from the Book of Life . I will speak of them by name to my Father and his angels .
66003006	' Those who have ears should listen to what the Holy Spirit says to the churches . '
66003007	" Here is what I command you to write to the church in Philadelphia . Here are the words of the One who is holy and true . He holds the key of David . No one can shut what he opens . And no one can open what he shuts . He says ,
66003008	' I know what you are doing . Look ! I have put an open door in front of you . No one can shut it . I know that you don't have much strength . But you have obeyed my word . You have not said no to me .
66003009	' Some people claim they are Jews but are not . They are liars . Their worship is from Satan . I will make them come and fall down at your feet . I will make them say in public that I love you .
66003010	' You have kept my command to put up with anything that happens . So I will keep you from the time of suffering that is going to come to the whole world . It will test those who live on the earth .
66003011	' I am coming soon . Hold on to what you have . Then no one will take away your crown .
66003012	' I'll see to it that those who overcome will be pillars in the temple of my God . They will never leave it again . I will write the name of my God on them . I will write the name of the city of my God on them . This is the new Jerusalem , which is coming down out of heaven from my God . I will also write my new name on them .
66003013	' Those who have ears should listen to what the Holy Spirit says to the churches . '
66003014	" Here is what I command you to write to the church in Laodicea . Here are the words of the One who is the Amen . What he gives witness to is faithful and true . He rules over what God has created . He says ,
66003015	' I know what you are doing . I know you aren't cold or hot . I wish you were either one or the other !
66003016	But you are lukewarm . You aren't hot or cold . So I am going to spit you out of my mouth .
66003017	' You say , " I am rich . I've become wealthy and don't need anything . " But you don't realize how pitiful and miserable you have become . You are poor , blind and naked .
66003018	' So here's my advice . Buy from me gold made pure by fire . Then you will become rich . Buy from me white clothes to wear . Then you will be able to cover your shameful nakedness . And buy from me healing lotion to put on your eyes . Then you will be able to see .
66003019	' I correct and train those I love . So be sincere , and turn away from your sins .
66003020	' Here I am ! I stand at the door and knock . If any of you hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in and eat with you . And you will eat with me .
66003021	' I'll give those who overcome the right to sit with me on my throne . In the same way , I overcame . Then I sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	' Those who have ears should listen to what the Holy Spirit says to the churches . ' "
66004001	After this I looked , and there in front of me was a door standing open in heaven . I heard the voice I had heard before . It sounded like a trumpet . The voice said , " Come up here . I will show you what must happen after this . "
66004002	At once the Holy Spirit took complete control of me . There in front of me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it .
66004003	The One who sat there shone like jewels . Around the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald .
66004004	Twenty-four other thrones surrounded that throne . Twenty-four elders were sitting on them . The elders were dressed in white . They had gold crowns on their heads .
66004005	From the throne came flashes of lightning , rumblings and thunder . Seven lamps were blazing in front of the throne . These stand for the seven spirits of God .
66004006	There was something that looked like a sea of glass in front of the throne . It was as clear as crystal . In the inner circle , around the throne , were four living creatures . They were covered with eyes , in front and in back .
66004007	The first creature looked like a lion . The second looked like an ox . The third had a man's face . The fourth looked like a flying eagle .
66004008	Each of the four living creatures had six wings . Each creature was covered all over with eyes , even under the wings . Day and night , they never stop saying , " Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God who rules over all . He was , and he is , and he will come . "
66004009	The living creatures give glory , honor and thanks to the One who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever .
66004010	At the same time , the 24 elders fall down and worship the One who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever . They lay their crowns in front of the throne . They say ,
66004011	" You are worthy , our Lord and God ! You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power . You are worthy because you created all things . They were created and they exist . That is the way you planned it . "
66005001	Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne . The scroll had writing on both sides . It was sealed with seven seals .
66005002	I saw a mighty angel calling out in a loud voice , " Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? "
66005003	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll . No one could even look inside it .
66005004	I cried and cried because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , " Do not cry ! The Lion of the tribe of Judah has won the battle . He is the Root of David . He is able to break the seven seals and open the scroll . "
66005006	Then I saw a Lamb that looked as if he had been put to death . He stood in the center of the area around the throne . The Lamb was surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders . He had seven horns and seven eyes . The eyes stand for the seven spirits of God , which are sent out into all the earth .
66005007	The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One sitting on the throne .
66005008	Then the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down in front of the Lamb . Each one had a harp . They were holding golden bowls full of incense , which stand for the prayers of God's people .
66005009	Here is the new song they sang . " You are worthy to take the scroll and break open its seals . You are worthy because you were put to death . With your blood you bought people for God . They come from every tribe , language , people and nation .
66005010	You have made them members of a royal family . You have made them priests to serve our God . They will rule on the earth . "
66005011	Then I looked and heard the voice of millions and millions of angels . They surrounded the throne . They surrounded the living creatures and the elders .
66005012	In a loud voice they sang , " The Lamb , who was put to death , is worthy ! He is worthy to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength ! He is worthy to receive honor and glory and praise ! "
66005013	All creatures in heaven , on earth , under the earth , and on the sea , and all that is in them , were singing . I heard them say , " May praise and honor for ever and ever be given to the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb ! Give them glory and power ' XY ' for ever and ever ! "
66005014	The four living creatures said , " Amen . " And the elders fell down and worshiped .
66006001	I watched as the Lamb broke open the first of the seven seals . Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice that sounded like thunder , " Come ! "
66006002	I looked , and there in front of me was a white horse ! Its rider held a bow in his hands . He was given a crown . He rode out like a hero on his way to victory .
66006003	The Lamb broke open the second seal . Then I heard the second living creature say , " Come ! "
66006004	Another horse came out . It was flaming red . Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other . He was given a large sword .
66006005	The Lamb broke open the third seal . Then I heard the third living creature say , " Come ! " I looked , and there in front of me was a black horse ! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand .
66006006	Next , I heard what sounded like a voice coming from among the four living creatures . It said , " A quart of wheat for a day's pay . And three quarts of barley for a day's pay . But don't spoil the olive oil and the wine ! "
66006007	The Lamb broke open the fourth seal . Then I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , " Come ! "
66006008	I looked , and there in front of me was a pale horse ! Its rider's name was Death . Following close behind him was Hell . They were given power over a fourth of the earth . They were given power to kill people with the sword , hunger and sickness . They could also use the earth's wild animals to kill .
66006009	He broke open the fifth seal . I saw souls under the altar . They were the souls of people who were killed because of God's word and their faithful witness .
66006010	They called out in a loud voice . " How long , Lord and King , holy and true ? " they asked . " How long will you wait to judge those who live on the earth ? How long will it be until you pay them back for killing us ? "
66006011	Then each of them was given a white robe . " Wait a little longer , " they were told . " There are still more of your believing brothers and sisters who must be killed . "
66006012	I watched as he broke open the sixth seal . There was a powerful earthquake . The sun turned black like black clothes that were made from the hair of a goat . The whole moon turned as red as blood .
66006013	The stars in the sky fell to earth . They dropped like ripe figs from a tree shaken by a strong wind .
66006014	The sky rolled back like a scroll . Every mountain and island was moved out of its place .
66006015	Everyone hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains . This included the kings of the earth , the princes and the generals , rich people and powerful people . It also included every slave and everyone who was free .
66006016	They called out to the mountains and rocks , " Fall on us ! Hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne ! Hide us from the anger of the Lamb !
66006017	The great day of their anger has come . Who can live through it ? "
66007001	After this I saw four angels . They were standing at the four corners of the earth . They were holding back the four winds of the earth . This kept the winds from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east . He had the seal of the living God . He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been allowed to harm the land and the sea .
66007003	" Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees , " he said . " Wait until we mark with a seal the foreheads of those who serve our God . "
66007004	Then I heard how many people were sealed . There were 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel .
66007005	From the tribe of Judah , 12,000 were sealed . From the tribe of Reuben , 12,000 . From the tribe of Gad , 12,000 .
66007006	From the tribe of Asher , 12,000 . From the tribe of Naphtali , 12,000 . From the tribe of Manasseh , 12,000 .
66007007	From the tribe of Simeon , 12,000 . From the tribe of Levi , 12,000 . From the tribe of Issachar , 12,000 .
66007008	From the tribe of Zebulun , 12,000 . From the tribe of Joseph , 12,000 . From the tribe of Benjamin , 12,000 .
66007009	After this I looked , and there in front of me was a huge crowd of people . They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb . There were so many that no one could count them . They came from every nation , tribe , people and language . They were wearing white robes . In their hands they were holding palm branches .
66007010	They cried out in a loud voice , " Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne . Salvation also belongs to the Lamb . "
66007011	All the angels were standing around the throne . They were standing around the elders and the four living creatures . They fell down on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God .
66007012	They said , " Amen ! May praise and glory and wisdom be given to our God for ever and ever . Give him thanks and honor and power and strength . Amen ! "
66007013	Then one of the elders spoke to me . " Who are these people dressed in white robes ? " he asked . " Where did they come from ? "
66007014	I answered , " Sir , you know . " He said , " They are the ones who have come out of the time of terrible suffering . They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	So " they are in front of the throne of God . They serve him day and night in his temple . The One who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them .
66007016	Never again will they be hungry . Never again will they be thirsty . The sun will not beat down on them . The heat of the desert will not harm them .
66007017	The Lamb , who is at the center of the area around the throne , will be their shepherd . He will lead them to springs of living water . And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
66008001	The Lamb opened the seventh seal . Then there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	I saw the seven angels who stand in front of God . Seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel came and stood at the altar . He had a shallow gold cup for burning incense . He was given a lot of incense to offer on the golden altar in front of the throne . With the incense he offered the prayers of all God's people .
66008004	The smoke of the incense together with the prayers of God's people rose up from the angel's hand . It went up in front of God .
66008005	Then the angel took the cup and filled it with fire from the altar . He threw it down on the earth . There were rumblings and thunder , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake .
66008006	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them .
66008007	The first angel blew his trumpet . Hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth . A third of the earth was burned up . A third of the trees were burned up . All the green grass was burned up .
66008008	The second angel blew his trumpet . Something that looked like a huge mountain on fire was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea turned into blood .
66008009	A third of the living creatures in the sea died . A third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	The third angel blew his trumpet . Then a great star fell from the sky . It looked like a blazing torch . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
66008011	The name of the star is Wormwood . A third of the water turned bitter . Many people died from it .
66008012	The fourth angel blew his trumpet . Then a third of the sun was struck . A third of the moon was struck . A third of the stars were struck . So a third of each of them turned dark . Then a third of the day had no light . The same thing happened to a third of the night .
66008013	As I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air . It called out in a loud voice , " How terrible ! How terrible it will be for those living on the earth ! How terrible ! They will suffer as soon as the next three angels blow their trumpets ! "
66009001	The fifth angel blew his trumpet . Then I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth . The star was given the key to the tunnel leading down into the Abyss .
66009002	When the star opened the Abyss , smoke rose up from it like the smoke from a huge furnace . The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss .
66009003	Out of the smoke came locusts . They settled down on the earth . They were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth .
66009004	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree . They were supposed to harm only the people who didn't have God's seal on their foreheads .
66009005	They were not allowed to kill them . But they could hurt them over and over for five months . The pain the people suffered was like the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man .
66009006	In those days , people will look for a way to die but won't find it . They will want to die , but death will escape them .
66009007	The locusts looked like horses ready for battle . On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold . Their faces looked like human faces .
66009008	Their hair was like women's hair . Their teeth were like lions' teeth .
66009009	Their chests were covered with something that looked like armor made out of iron . The sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle .
66009010	They had tails and stings like scorpions . And in their tails they had power to hurt people over and over for five months .
66009011	Their king was the angel of the Abyss . In the Hebrew language his name is Abaddon . In Greek it is Apollyon .
66009012	The first terrible judgment is past . Two others are still coming .
66009013	The sixth angel blew his trumpet . Then I heard a voice coming from the corners of the golden altar that stands in front of God .
66009014	The voice spoke to the sixth angel who had the trumpet . It said , " Set the four angels free who are held at the great river Euphrates . "
66009015	The four angels had been ready for this very hour and day and month and year . They were set free to kill a third of all people .
66009016	The number of troops on horseback was 200,000,000 . I heard how many there were .
66009017	The horses and riders I saw in my vision had armor on their chests . It was flaming red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur . The heads of the horses looked like lions' heads . Out of their mouths came fire , smoke and sulfur .
66009018	A third of all people were killed by the three plagues of fire , smoke and sulfur that came out of the horses' mouths .
66009019	The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails . The tails were like snakes whose heads could bite .
66009020	The people who were not killed by these plagues still did not turn away from what they had been doing . They did not stop worshiping demons . They kept worshiping statues of gods made out of gold , silver , bronze , stone and wood , which can't see or hear or walk .
66009021	The people also did not turn away from their murders , witchcraft , sexual sins and stealing .
66010001	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven . He was wearing a cloud like a robe . There was a rainbow above his head . His face was like the sun . His legs were like pillars of fire .
66010002	He was holding a little scroll . It was lying open in his hand . The angel put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
66010003	Then he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion . When he shouted , the voices of the seven thunders spoke .
66010004	When they had spoken , I was getting ready to write . But I heard a voice from heaven say , " Seal up what the seven thunders have said . Do not write it down . "
66010005	Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .
66010006	He made a promise in the name of the One who lives for ever and ever . He took an oath in the name of the One who created the sky , earth and sea and all that is in them . He said , " There will be no more waiting !
66010007	But in the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , the last part of God's plan will be carried out . God told all this to the prophets who served him long ago . "
66010008	Then the voice I had heard from heaven spoke to me again . It said , " Go and take the scroll from the angel standing on the sea and on the land . It is lying open in his hand . "
66010009	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll . He said to me , " Take it and eat it . It will become sour in your stomach . But in your mouth it will taste as sweet as honey . "
66010010	I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it . In my mouth it tasted as sweet as honey . But when I had eaten it , it became sour in my stomach .
66010011	Then I was told , " You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages and kings . "
66011001	I was given a long stick that looked like a measuring rod . I was told , " Go and measure the temple of God and the altar . Count the worshipers who are there .
66011002	But do not measure the outer courtyard . It has been given to those who aren't Jews . They will overrun the holy city for 42 months .
66011003	" I will give power to my two witnesses . They will prophesy for 1,260 days . They will be dressed in black clothes to show how sad they are . "
66011004	The witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand in front of the Lord of the earth .
66011005	If anyone tries to harm them , fire comes from their mouths and eats up their enemies . This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die .
66011006	These witnesses have power to close up the sky . Then it will not rain while they are prophesying . They also have power to turn the waters into blood . And they can strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want to .
66011007	When they have finished giving their witness , the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them . He will overpower them and kill them .
66011008	Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city where their Lord was nailed to the cross . The city is sometimes pictured as Sodom , or as Egypt .
66011009	For three and a half days , people from every tribe , language and nation will stare at their bodies . They will refuse to bury them .
66011010	Those who live on the earth will be happy about this and will celebrate . They will send each other gifts , because these two prophets had made them suffer .
66011011	But after the three and a half days , a breath of life from God entered the two witnesses . They stood up . Terror struck those who saw them .
66011012	Then the two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven . It said to them , " Come up here . " They went up to heaven in a cloud . Their enemies watched it happen .
66011013	At that very hour there was a powerful earthquake . A tenth of the city crumbled and fell . In the earthquake , 7,000 people were killed . Those who lived through it were terrified . They gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second terrible judgment has passed . The third is coming soon .
66011015	The seventh angel blew his trumpet . There were loud voices in heaven . They said , " The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ . He will rule for ever and ever . "
66011016	The 24 elders were sitting on their thrones in front of God . They fell on their faces and worshiped God .
66011017	They said , " Lord God who rules over all , we give thanks to you . You are the One who is and who was . We give you thanks because you have taken your great power and have begun to rule .
66011018	The nations were angry , and the time for your anger has come . The time has come to judge the dead . It is time to reward your servants the prophets and your own people and those who honor you . There is a reward for all your people , both great and small . It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth . "
66011019	Then God's temple in heaven was opened . Inside it the wooden chest called the ark of his covenant could be seen . There were flashes of lightning , rumblings and thunder , an earthquake and a great hailstorm .
66012001	A great and miraculous sign appeared in heaven . It was a woman wearing the sun like clothes . The moon was under her feet . On her head she wore a crown of 12 stars .
66012002	She was pregnant . She cried out in pain because she was about to have a baby .
66012003	Then another sign appeared in heaven . It was a huge red dragon . He had seven heads and ten horns . On his seven heads he wore seven crowns .
66012004	His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky . It threw them down to earth . The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to have a baby . He wanted to eat her child the moment it was born .
66012005	She gave birth to a son . He will rule all the nations with an iron rod . Her child was taken up to God and to his throne .
66012006	The woman escaped into the desert where God had a place prepared for her . There she would be taken care of for 1,260 days .
66012007	There was war in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon . And the dragon and his angels fought back .
66012008	But the dragon wasn't strong enough . He and his angels lost their place in heaven .
66012009	The great dragon was thrown down to the earth , and his angels with him . The dragon is that old serpent called the devil , or Satan . He leads the whole world down the wrong path .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven . It said , " Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God have come . The authority of his Christ has come . Satan , who brings charges against our brothers and sisters , has been thrown down . He brings charges against them before our God day and night .
66012011	They overcame him because the Lamb gave his life's blood for them . They overcame him by giving witness about Jesus to others . They were willing to risk their lives , even if it led to death .
66012012	So be joyful , you heavens ! Be glad , all you who live there ! But how terrible it will be for the earth and the sea ! The devil has come down to you . He is very angry . He knows his time is short . "
66012013	The dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth . So he chased the woman who had given birth to the boy .
66012014	The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so that she could fly away . She could fly to the place prepared for her in the desert . There she would be taken care of for three and a half years . She would be out of the serpent's reach .
66012015	Then the serpent spit water like a river out of his mouth . He wanted to catch her and sweep her away in the flood .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman . It opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had spit out .
66012017	The dragon was very angry with the woman . He went off to make war against the rest of her children . They obey God's commands and hold firmly to what Jesus has said .
66013001	The dragon stood on the seashore . I saw a beast coming out of the sea . He had ten horns and seven heads . There were ten crowns on his horns . On each head was an evil name that was displeasing to God .
66013002	The beast I saw looked like a leopard . But he had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion . The dragon gave the beast his power , his throne , and great authority .
66013003	One of the beast's heads seemed to have had a deadly wound . But the wound had been healed . The whole world was amazed and followed the beast .
66013004	People worshiped the dragon , because he had given authority to the beast . They also worshiped the beast . They asked , " Who is like the beast ? Who can make war against him ? "
66013005	The beast was given a mouth to brag and speak evil things against God . The beast was allowed to use his authority for 42 months .
66013006	He opened his mouth to speak evil things against God . He told lies about God's character and about the place where God lives and about those who live in heaven with him .
66013007	He was allowed to make war against God's people and to overcome them . He was given authority over every tribe , people , language and nation .
66013008	All who live on earth whose names have not been written in the Book of Life will worship the beast . The Book of Life belongs to the Lamb whose death was planned before the world was created .
66013009	Everyone who has ears should listen .
66013010	Everyone who is supposed to be captured will be captured . Everyone who is supposed to be killed with a sword will be killed with a sword . So God's people must be patient and faithful .
66013011	Then I saw another beast . This one came out of the earth . He had two horns like a lamb . But he spoke like a dragon .
66013012	He had all the authority of the first beast . He did what that beast wanted . He made the earth and all who live on it worship the first beast . The first beast was the one whose deadly wound had been healed .
66013013	The second beast did great and miraculous signs . He even made fire come from heaven . It came down to earth where everyone could see it .
66013014	He did the signs the first beast wanted him to do . In that way the second beast tricked those who live on the earth . He ordered them to set up a statue to honor the first beast . The first beast was the one who had been wounded by the sword and still lived .
66013015	The second beast was allowed to give breath to the statue so it could speak . He was allowed to kill all who refused to worship the statue .
66013016	He also forced everyone to receive a mark on the right hand or on the forehead . People great or small , rich or poor , free or slave had to receive the mark .
66013017	They could not buy or sell anything unless they had the mark . The mark is the name of the beast or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is a problem that you have to be wise to figure out . If you can , figure out what the beast's number means . It is man's number . His number is 666 .
66014001	I looked , and there in front of me was the Lamb . He was standing on Mount Zion . With him were 144,000 people . Written on their foreheads were his name and his Father's name .
66014002	I heard a sound from heaven . It was like the roar of rushing waters and loud thunder . The sound I heard was like the music of harps being played .
66014003	Then everyone sang a new song in front of the throne . They sang it in front of the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the song except the 144,000 . They had been set free from the evil of the earth .
66014004	They had not committed sexual sins with women . They had kept themselves pure . They follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They were purchased from among people as a first offering to God and the Lamb .
66014005	Their mouths told no lies . They are without blame .
66014006	I saw another angel . He was flying high in the air . He came to tell everyone on earth the good news that will always be true . He told it to every nation , tribe , language and people .
66014007	In a loud voice he said , " Have respect for God . Give him glory . The hour has come for God to judge . Worship him who made the heavens and the earth . Worship him who made the sea and the springs of water . "
66014008	A second angel followed him . He said , " Fallen ! Babylon the Great has fallen ! The city of Babylon made all the nations drink the strong wine of her terrible sins . "
66014009	A third angel followed them . He said in a loud voice , " Watch out , all you who worship the beast and his statue ! Watch out , all you who have his mark on your forehead or your hand !
66014010	You , too , will drink the wine of God's great anger . His wine has been poured full strength into the cup of his anger . You will be burned with flaming sulfur . The holy angels and the Lamb will see it happen .
66014011	The smoke of your terrible suffering will rise for ever and ever . Day and night , there is no rest for you who worship the beast and his statue . There is no rest for you who receive the mark of his name . "
66014012	God's people need to be very patient . They are the ones who obey God's commands . They remain faithful to Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven . " Write this , " it said . " Blessed are the dead who die as believers in the Lord from now on . " " Yes , " says the Holy Spirit . " They will rest from their labor . What they have done will not be forgotten . "
66014014	I looked , and there in front of me was a white cloud . Sitting on the cloud was One who looked " like a son of man . " He wore a gold crown on his head . In his hand was a sharp , curved blade for cutting grain .
66014015	Then another angel came out of the temple . He called in a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud . " Take your blade , " he said . " Cut the grain . The time has come . The earth is ready to be harvested . "
66014016	So the one sitting on the cloud swung his blade over the earth . And the earth was harvested .
66014017	Another angel came out of the temple in heaven . He too had a sharp , curved blade .
66014018	Still another angel came from the altar . He was in charge of the fire on the altar . He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp blade . " Take your blade , " he said , " and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth's vine . Its grapes are ripe . "
66014019	So the angel swung his blade over the earth . He gathered its grapes . Then he threw them into a huge winepress . The winepress stands for God's anger .
66014020	In the winepress outside the city , the grapes were stomped on . Blood flowed out of the pit . It spread over the land for about 180 miles . It rose as high as the horses' heads .
66015001	I saw in heaven another great and miraculous sign . Seven angels were about to bring the seven last plagues . The plagues would complete God's anger .
66015002	Then I saw something that looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . Standing beside the sea were those who had won the battle over the beast . They had also overcome his statue and the number of his name . They held harps given to them by God .
66015003	They sang the song of Moses , who served God , and the song of the Lamb . They sang , " Lord God who rules over all , everything you do is great and wonderful . King of the ages , your ways are true and fair .
66015004	Lord , who will not have respect for you ? Who will not bring glory to your name ? You alone are holy . All nations will come and worship you . They see that the things you do are right . "
66015005	After this I looked , and the temple was opened in heaven . The temple is the holy tent where the tablets of the covenant were kept .
66015006	Out of the temple came the seven angels who were bringing the seven plagues . They were dressed in clean , shining linen . They wore gold strips of cloth around their chests .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave seven golden bowls to the seven angels . The bowls were filled with the anger of God , who lives for ever and ever .
66015008	The temple was filled with smoke that came from the glory and power of God . No one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple speaking to the seven angels . " Go , " it said . " Pour out the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth . "
66016002	The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land . Ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his statue .
66016003	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea . It turned into blood like the blood of a dead person . Every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and on the springs of water . They became blood .
66016005	Then I heard the angel who was in charge of the waters . He said , " The way you judge is fair . You are the Holy One . You are the One who is and who was .
66016006	The beast's worshipers have poured out the life's blood of your people and your prophets . So you have given those worshipers blood to drink . That's exactly what they should get . "
66016007	Then I heard the altar reply , " Lord God who rules over all , the way you judge is true and fair . "
66016008	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun . The sun was allowed to burn people with fire .
66016009	They were burned by the blazing heat . So they spoke evil things against the name of God , who controlled these plagues . But they refused to turn away from their sins . They did not give glory to God .
66016010	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast . The kingdom of the beast became very dark . People bit their tongues because they were suffering so much .
66016011	They spoke evil things against the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores . But they refused to turn away from the sins they had committed .
66016012	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates . Its water dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East .
66016013	Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs . They came out of the mouths of the dragon , the beast and the false prophet .
66016014	They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs . They go out to gather the kings of the whole world for battle . That battle will take place on the great day of the God who rules over all .
66016015	" Look ! I am coming like a thief ! Blessed are those who stay awake and keep their clothes with them . They will not be caught naked . They will not be put to shame . "
66016016	Then the evil spirits gathered the kings together . The place where the kings met is called Armageddon in the Hebrew language .
66016017	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air . Out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne . It said , " It is done ! "
66016018	Then there came flashes of lightning , rumblings , thunder and a powerful earthquake . There has never been an earthquake as terrible as this since man has lived on earth .
66016019	The great city split into three parts . The cities of the nations crumbled and fell . God remembered Babylon the Great . He gave her the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger .
66016020	Every island ran away . The mountains could not be found .
66016021	Huge hailstones of about 100 pounds each fell from the sky . The hail crushed people . They spoke evil things against God because the plague of hail was so terrible .
66017001	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came to me . He said , " Come . I will show you how the great prostitute will be punished . She is the one who sits on many waters .
66017002	The kings of the earth took part in her evil ways . The people living on earth were drunk with the wine of her terrible sins . "
66017003	Then the angel carried me away in a vision . The Holy Spirit took me into a desert . There I saw a woman sitting on a bright red beast . It was covered with names that say evil things that are displeasing to God . It had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was dressed in purple and bright red . She was gleaming with gold , jewels and pearls . In her hand she held a golden cup filled with things that God hates . It was filled with her terrible , dirty sins .
66017005	Here is the name that was written on her forehead . mystery the great city of babylon the mother of prostitutes the mother of everything on earth that god hates
66017006	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God's people . They are the ones who gave witness to Jesus . When I saw her , I was very amazed .
66017007	Then the angel said to me , " Why are you amazed ? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides on . The beast is the one who has the seven heads and ten horns .
66017008	The beast that you saw used to exist . But now he does not . He will come up out of the Abyss . He will be destroyed . Some of the people who live on the earth will be amazed when they see the beast . Their names have not been written in the Book of Life from the time the world was created . They will be amazed because even though the beast used to exist and now does not , he will come again .
66017009	" Here is a problem that you have to be wise to understand . The seven heads are seven hills that the woman sits on .
66017010	They are also seven kings . Five have fallen , one is ruling , and the other has still not come . When he does come , he must remain for a little while .
66017011	" The beast who used to exist , and now does not , is an eighth king . He belongs to the other seven . He will be destroyed .
66017012	" The ten horns you saw are ten kings . They have not yet received a kingdom . But for one hour they will receive authority to rule together with the beast .
66017013	They have only one purpose . So they give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will make war against the Lamb . But the Lamb will overcome them because he is the most powerful Lord of all and the greatest King of all . His appointed , chosen and faithful followers will be with him . "
66017015	Then the angel spoke to me . " You saw the waters the prostitute sits on , " he said . " They stand for all the nations of the world , no matter what their race or language is .
66017016	The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute . They will destroy her and leave her naked . They will eat her flesh and burn her with fire .
66017017	God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose . So they agreed to give the beast their power to rule . They will give him that power until God's words come true .
66017018	" The woman you saw stands for the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . "
66018001	After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven . He had great authority . His glory filled the earth with light .
66018002	With a mighty voice he shouted , " Fallen ! Babylon the Great has fallen ! She has become a place where demons live . She has become a den for every evil spirit . She has become a nest for every ' unclean ' and hated bird .
66018003	All the nations have drunk the strong wine of her terrible sins . The kings of the earth took part in her evil ways . The traders of the world grew rich from her great wealth . "
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven . It said , " Come out of her , my people . Then you will not take part in her sins . You will not suffer from any of her plagues .
66018005	Her sins are piled up to heaven . God has remembered her crimes .
66018006	Do to her as she has done to others . Pay her back double for what she has done . Mix her a double dose of what she has mixed for others .
66018007	Give her as much pain and suffering as the glory and wealth she gave herself . She brags to herself , ' I rule like a queen . I am not a widow . I will never be sad . '
66018008	But she will be plagued by death , sadness and hunger . In a single day they will all catch up with her . She will be burned up by fire . The Lord God who judges her is mighty .
66018009	" The kings of the earth who committed terrible sins with her will sob . They will be sad because they used to share her riches . They will see the smoke rising as she burns .
66018010	They will be terrified by her suffering . Standing far away , they will exclaim , " ' How terrible ! How terrible it is for you , great city ! How terrible for you , Babylon , city of power ! In just one hour you have been destroyed ! '
66018011	" The traders of the world will cry and be sad over her . No one buys what they sell anymore .
66018012	Here is what they had for sale . Gold , silver , jewels , pearls . Fine linen , purple , silk , bright red cloth . Every kind of expensive wood . All sorts of articles made out of ivory , valuable wood , bronze , iron and marble .
66018013	Cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , frankincense . Wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat . Cattle , sheep , horses , carriages , human slaves .
66018014	" The merchants will say , ' The pleasure you longed for has left you . All your riches and glory have disappeared forever . '
66018015	The traders who sold these things and became rich because of her will stand far away . Her suffering will terrify them . They will cry and be sad .
66018016	They will cry out , " ' How terrible ! How terrible it is for you , great city , dressed in fine linen , purple and bright red ! How terrible for you , great city , gleaming with gold , jewels and pearls !
66018017	In just one hour your great wealth has been destroyed ! ' " Every sea captain and all who travel by ship will stand far away . So will the sailors and all who earn their living from the sea .
66018018	They will see the smoke rising as Babylon burns . They will ask , ' Was there ever a city like this great city ? '
66018019	They will throw dust on their heads . They will cry and be sad . They will cry out , " ' How terrible ! How terrible it is for you , great city ! All who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth ! In just one hour she has been destroyed !
66018020	Heaven , be glad for this ! God's people , be glad ! Apostles and prophets , be glad ! God has judged her for the way she treated you . ' "
66018021	Then a mighty angel picked up a huge rock . It was the size of a large millstone . He threw it into the sea . Then he said , " That is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down . Never again will it be found .
66018022	The songs of musicians will never be heard in you again . Gone will be the music of harp , flute and trumpet . No worker of any kind will ever be found in you again . The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again .
66018023	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again . The voices of brides and grooms will never be heard in you again . Your traders were among the world's most important people . By your magic spell all the nations were led down the wrong path .
66018024	You were guilty of the murder of prophets and God's people . You were guilty of the blood of all who have been killed on the earth . "
66019001	After these things I heard a roar in heaven . It sounded like a huge crowd shouting , " Hallelujah ! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God .
66019002	The way he judges is true and fair . He has judged the great prostitute . She polluted the earth with her terrible sins . God has paid her back for killing those who served him . "
66019003	Again they shouted , " Hallelujah ! The smoke from her fire goes up for ever and ever . "
66019004	The 24 elders and the four living creatures bowed down . They worshiped God , who was sitting on the throne . They cried out , " Amen ! Hallelujah ! "
66019005	Then a voice came from the throne . It said , " Praise our God , all you who serve him ! Praise God , all you who have respect for him , both great and small ! "
66019006	Then I heard the noise of a huge crowd . It sounded like the roar of rushing waters and like loud thunder . The people were shouting , " Hallelujah ! Our Lord God is the King who rules over all .
66019007	Let us be joyful and glad ! Let us give him glory ! It is time for the Lamb's wedding . His bride has made herself ready .
66019008	Fine linen , bright and clean , was given to her to wear . " Fine linen stands for the right things that God's people do .
66019009	Here is what the angel told me to write . " Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb ! " Then he added , " These are the true words of God . "
66019010	When I heard this , I fell at his feet to worship him . But he said to me , " Don't do that ! I serve God , just as you do . I am God's servant , just like other believers who hold firmly to what Jesus has taught . Worship God ! What Jesus taught is the very heart of prophecy . "
66019011	I saw heaven standing open . There in front of me was a white horse . Its rider is called Faithful and True . When he judges or makes war , he is always fair .
66019012	His eyes are like blazing fire . On his head are many crowns . A name is written on him that only he knows .
66019013	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood . His name is The Word of God .
66019014	The armies of heaven were following him , riding on white horses . They were dressed in fine linen , white and clean .
66019015	Out of the rider's mouth comes a sharp sword . He will strike down the nations with it . Scripture says , " He will rule them with an iron rod . " He stomps on the grapes of God's winepress . The winepress stands for the terrible anger of the God who rules over all .
66019016	Here is the name that is written on the rider's robe and on his thigh . the greatest king of all and the most powerful lord of all
66019017	I saw an angel standing in the sun . He cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying high in the air , " Come ! Gather together for the great supper of God .
66019018	Come and eat the dead bodies of kings , generals , and other mighty people . Eat the bodies of horses and their riders . Eat the bodies of all people , free and slave , great and small . "
66019019	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies . They had gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .
66019020	But the beast and the false prophet were captured . The false prophet had done miraculous signs for the beast . In this way the false prophet had tricked those who had received the mark of the beast and had worshiped his statue . The beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
66019021	The rest of them were killed with the sword that came out of the rider's mouth . All the birds stuffed themselves with the dead bodies .
66020001	I saw an angel coming down out of heaven . He had the key to the Abyss . In his hand he held a heavy chain .
66020002	He grabbed the dragon , that old serpent . The serpent is also called the devil , or Satan . The angel put him in chains for 1,000 years .
66020003	Then he threw him into the Abyss . He locked it and sealed him in . This was to keep Satan from fooling the nations anymore until the 1,000 years were ended . After that , he must be set free for a short time .
66020004	I saw thrones . Those who had been given authority to judge were sitting on them . I also saw the souls of those whose heads had been cut off because they had given witness for Jesus and because of God's word . They had not worshiped the beast or his statue . They had not received his mark on their foreheads or hands . They came to life and ruled with Christ for 1,000 years .
66020005	This is the first resurrection . The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended .
66020006	Blessed and holy are those who take part in the first resurrection . The second death has no power over them . They will be priests of God and of Christ . They will rule with him for 1,000 years .
66020007	When the 1,000 years are over , Satan will be set free from his prison .
66020008	He will go out to fool the nations . He will gather them from the four corners of the earth . He will bring Gog and Magog together for battle . Their troops are as many as the grains of sand on the seashore .
66020009	They marched across the whole earth . They surrounded the place where God's people were camped . It was the city he loves . But fire came down from heaven and burned them up .
66020010	The devil , who fooled them , was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur . That is where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown . They will all suffer day and night for ever and ever .
66020011	I saw a great white throne and the One who was sitting on it . When the earth and sky saw his face , they ran away . There was no place for them .
66020012	I saw the dead , great and small , standing in front of the throne . Books were opened . Then another book was opened . It was the Book of Life . The dead were judged by what they had done . The things they had done were written in the books .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead that were in it . And Death and Hell gave up their dead . Each of the dead was judged by what he had done .
66020014	Then Death and Hell were thrown into the lake of fire . The lake of fire is the second death .
66020015	Anyone whose name was not written in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	I saw a new heaven and a new earth . The first heaven and the first earth were completely gone . There was no longer any sea .
66021002	I saw the Holy City , the new Jerusalem . It was coming down out of heaven from God . It was prepared like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband .
66021003	I heard a loud voice from the throne . It said , " Now God makes his home with people . He will live with them . They will be his people . And God himself will be with them and be their God .
66021004	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes . There will be no more death or sadness . There will be no more crying or pain . Things are no longer the way they used to be . "
66021005	He who was sitting on the throne said , " I am making everything new ! " Then he said , " Write this down . You can trust these words . They are true . "
66021006	He said to me , " It is done . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last . I am the Beginning and the End . Anyone who is thirsty may drink from the spring of the water of life . It doesn't cost anything !
66021007	Anyone who overcomes will receive all this from me . I will be his God , and he will be my child .
66021008	" But others will have their place in the lake of fire that burns with sulfur . Those who are afraid and those who do not believe will be there . Murderers and those who pollute themselves will join them . Those who commit sexual sins and those who practice witchcraft will go there . Those who worship statues of gods and all who tell lies will be there too . It is the second death . "
66021009	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me . The bowls were filled with the seven last plagues . The angel said , " Come . I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb . "
66021010	Then he carried me away in a vision . The Spirit took me to a huge , high mountain . He showed me Jerusalem , the Holy City . It was coming down out of heaven from God .
66021011	It shone with the glory of God . It gleamed like a very valuable jewel . It was like a jasper , as clear as crystal .
66021012	The city had a huge , high wall with 12 gates . Twelve angels were at the gates , one at each of them . On the gates were written the names of the 12 tribes of Israel .
66021013	There were three gates on the east and three on the north . There were three gates on the south and three on the west .
66021014	The wall of the city had 12 foundations . Written on them were the names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	The angel who talked with me had a gold measuring rod . He used it to measure the city , its gates and its walls .
66021016	The city was laid out like a square . It was as long as it was wide . The angel measured the city with the rod . It was 1,400 miles long . It was as wide and high as it was long .
66021017	He measured the wall of the city . It was 200 feet thick . The angel did the measuring as a man would .
66021018	The wall was made out of jasper . The city was made out of pure gold , as pure as glass .
66021019	The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of jewel . The first foundation was made out of jasper . The second was made out of sapphire . The third was made out of chalcedony . The fourth was made out of emerald .
66021020	The fifth was made out of sardonyx . The sixth was made out of carnelian . The seventh was made out of chrysolite . The eighth was made out of beryl . The ninth was made out of topaz . The tenth was made out of chrysoprase . The eleventh was made out of jacinth . The twelfth was made out of amethyst .
66021021	The 12 gates were made from 12 pearls . Each gate was made out of a single pearl . The main street of the city was made out of pure gold , as clear as glass .
66021022	I didn't see a temple in the city . This was because the Lamb and the Lord God who rules over all are its temple .
66021023	The city does not need the sun or moon to shine on it . God's glory is its light , and the Lamb is its lamp .
66021024	The nations will walk by the light of the city . The kings of the world will bring their glory into it .
66021025	Its gates will never be shut , because there will be no night there .
66021026	The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it .
66021027	Only what is pure will enter it . No one who fools others or does shameful things will enter it . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life will enter the city .
66022001	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life . It was as clear as crystal . It flowed from the throne of God and of the Lamb .
66022002	It flowed down the middle of the city's main street . On each side of the river stood the tree of life , bearing 12 crops of fruit . Its fruit was ripe every month . The leaves of the tree bring healing to the nations .
66022003	There will no longer be any curse . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city . God's servants will serve him .
66022004	They will see his face . His name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	There will be no more night . They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun . The Lord God will give them light . They will rule for ever and ever .
66022006	The angel said to me , " You can trust these words . They are true . The Lord is the God of the spirits of the prophets . He sent his angel to show those who serve him the things that must soon take place . "
66022007	" Look ! I am coming soon ! Blessed are those who obey the words of the prophecy in this book . "
66022008	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . After I had heard and seen them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel . He is the one who had been showing me these things .
66022009	But he said to me , " Don't do that ! I serve God , just as you do . I am God's servant , just like the other prophets and all who obey the words of this book . Worship God ! "
66022010	Then he told me , " Do not seal up the words of the prophecy in this book . These things are about to happen .
66022011	Let those who do wrong keep on doing wrong . Let those who are evil continue to be evil . Let those who do what is right keep on doing what is right . And let those who are holy continue to be holy . "
66022012	" Look ! I am coming soon ! I bring my rewards with me . I will reward each person for what he has done .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega . I am the First and the Last . I am the Beginning and the End .
66022014	" Blessed are those who wash their robes . They will have the right to come to the tree of life . They will be allowed to go through the gates into the city .
66022015	" Outside the city are the dogs and those who practice witchcraft . Outside are also those who commit sexual sins and murder . Those who worship statues of gods , and everyone who loves and does what is false , are outside too .
66022016	" I , Jesus , have sent my angel to give you this witness for the churches . I am the Root and the Son of David . I am the bright Morning Star . "
66022017	The Holy Spirit and the bride say , " Come ! " Let those who hear say , " Come ! " Anyone who is thirsty should come . Anyone who wants to take the free gift of the water of life should do so .
66022018	I am warning everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book . If you add anything to them , God will add to you the plagues told about in this book .
66022019	If you take any words away from this book of prophecy , God will take away from you your share in the tree of life . He will also take away your place in the Holy City . This book tells about these things .
66022020	He who gives witness to these things says , " Yes . I am coming soon . " Amen . Come , Lord Jesus !
66022021	May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people . Amen .
