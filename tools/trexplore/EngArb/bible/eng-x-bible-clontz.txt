40001001	The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham :
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac , Isaac the father of Jacob , and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers ,
40001003	and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar , Perez the father of Hezron , and Hezron the father of Ram ,
40001004	Ram the father of Amminadab , Amminadab the father of Nahshon , and Nahshon the father of Salmon ,
40001005	Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab , Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth , and Obed the father of Jesse ,
40001006	and Jesse the father of King David . David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah ,
40001007	Solomon the father of Rehoboam , Rehoboam the father of Abijah , and Abijah the father of Asa ,
40001008	Asa the father of Jehoshaphat , Jehoshaphat the father of Joram , and Joram the father of Uzziah ,
40001009	Uzziah the father of Jotham , Jotham the father of Ahaz , and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah ,
40001010	Hezekiah the father of Manasseh , Manasseh the father of Amon , and Amon the father of Josiah ,
40001011	and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon .
40001012	And after the exile to Babylon : Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel , and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel ,
40001013	Zerubbabel the father of Abiud , Abiud the father of Eliakim , and Eliakim the father of Azor ,
40001014	Azor the father of Zadok , Zadok the father of Achim , and Achim the father of Eliud ,
40001015	Eliud the father of Eleazar , Eleazar the father of Matthan , and Matthan the father of Jacob ,
40001016	and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom Jesus was born , who is called Christ .
40001017	So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations , and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations , and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way : when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph , before they came together , she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not wanting to put her to public shame , was resolved to divorce her quietly .
40001020	But as he considered this , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , » Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
40001021	And she will give birth to a son , and you shall call his name Jesus , for he will save his people from their sins . «
40001022	All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet :
40001023	
40001024	When Joseph woke from sleep , he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife ,
40001025	but did not know her until she had borne a son . And he called his name Jesus .
40002001	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king , behold , wise men from the East came to Jerusalem ,
40002002	saying , » Where is he who has been born king of the Jews ? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him . «
40002003	When Herod the king heard this , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born .
40002005	So they said to him , » In Bethlehem of Judea , for thus it is written by the prophet :
40002006	
40002007	Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from them what time the star had appeared .
40002008	And he sent them to Bethlehem and said , » Go and search diligently for the young child , and when you have found him , bring back word to me , so that I too may come and worship him . «
40002009	When they had heard the king they went their way ; and behold , the star which they had seen in the East went before them , until it came to rest over the place where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy .
40002011	On coming into the house , they saw the child with his mother Mary , and they fell down and worshipped him . Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold , and of frankincense , and of myrrh .
40002012	And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod , they departed to their own country by another way .
40002013	Now when they had departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , » Rise , take the child and his mother , and flee to Egypt , and stay there until I tell you ; for Herod is about to search for the child , to destroy him . «
40002014	When he rose , he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt ,
40002015	and remained there until the death of Herod . And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet , » Out of Egypt have I called my son . «
40002016	Then Herod , when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men , was in a furious rage , and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or under , according to the time which he had determined from the wise men .
40002017	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah :
40002018	
40002019	But when Herod died , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
40002020	saying , » Rise , take the young child and his mother , and go to the land of Israel , for those who sought the young child’s life are dead . «
40002021	And he rose and took the child and his mother , and went to the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . And being warned in a dream , he withdrew to the district of Galilee ,
40002023	and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth , that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled , » He shall be called a Nazarene . «
40003001	In those days John the Baptist came , preaching in the wilderness of Judea ,
40003002	and saying , » Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . «
40003003	For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said , » The voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . «
40003004	Now John wore a garment of camel’s hair , and a leather belt around his waist ; and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him ,
40003006	and confessing their sins , they were baptized by him in the Jordan River .
40003007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism , he said to them , » You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
40003008	Bear fruit worthy of repentance ,
40003009	and do not think to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones .
40003010	Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees , and every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40003011	I baptize you with water for repentance , but he who is coming after me is mightier than I , whose sandals I am not worthy to carry . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
40003012	His winnowing fork is in his hand , and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn , but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire . «
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him .
40003014	But John tried to prevent him , saying , » I need to be baptized by you , and do you come to me ? «
40003015	But Jesus answered him , » Let it be so now ; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness . « Then he consented .
40003016	And when Jesus was baptized , he went up immediately from the water , and behold , the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and alighting on him .
40003017	And behold , a voice from heaven , saying , » This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . «
40004001	Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	And he fasted forty days and forty nights , and afterward he was hungry .
40004003	And the tempter came and said to him , » If you are the Son of God , command these stones to become loaves of bread . «
40004004	But he answered , » It is written , ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God . ’ «
40004005	Then the devil took him to the holy city , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple ,
40004006	and said to him , » If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down . For it is written , ‘ He will give his angels charge of you , ’ and ‘ In their hands they will bear you up , lest you strike your foot against a stone . ’ «
40004007	Jesus said to him , » Again it is written , ‘ You shall not tempt the Lord your God . ’ «
40004008	Again , the devil took him to a very high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory .
40004009	And he said to him , » All these I will give you , if you will fall down and worship me . «
40004010	Then Jesus said to him , » Away , Satan ! for it is written , ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve . ’ «
40004011	Then the devil left him , and behold , angels came and ministered to him .
40004012	Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison , he withdrew to Galilee .
40004013	And leaving Nazareth , he went and dwelt in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
40004014	that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled :
40004015	
40004016	
40004017	From that time Jesus began to preach and say , » Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . «
40004018	As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
40004019	And he said to them , » Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men . «
40004020	Immediately they left their nets and followed him .
40004021	Going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets . And he called them ,
40004022	and immediately they left the boat and their father , and followed him .
40004023	And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
40004024	Then his fame spread throughout all Syria , and they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains , and those who were demon-possessed , epileptics , and paralytics , and he healed them .
40004025	Great crowds followed him — from Galilee , and from the Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea , and beyond the Jordan .
40005001	Seeing the crowds , he went up on a mountain , and when he sat down his disciples came to him .
40005002	And he opened his mouth and taught them , saying :
40005003	
40005004	
40005005	
40005006	
40005007	
40005008	
40005009	
40005010	
40005011	Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you , and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake .
40005012	Rejoice and be glad , for great is your reward in heaven , for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	» You are the salt of the earth . But if the salt loses its taste , how shall it be made salty again ? It is no longer good for anything , except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A city set on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket , but on a stand , and it gives light to all in the house .
40005016	Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven .
40005017	» Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets ; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them .
40005018	For truly , I say to you , till heaven and earth pass away , not an iota , not a dot , will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished .
40005019	Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I tell you , that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	» You have heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not murder , and whoever murders will be liable to judgment . ’
40005022	But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment . And whoever says to his brother , ‘ Raca , ’ shall be answerable to the council . But whoever says , ‘ You fool ! ’ shall be in danger of the fire of hell .
40005023	Therefore , if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there before the altar , and go . First be reconciled to your brother ; and then come and offer your gift .
40005025	Agree with your adversary quickly , while you are on the way with him to court , lest your adversary deliver you to the judge , the judge hand you over to the officer , and you be thrown into prison .
40005026	Truly , I say to you , you will never get out till you have paid the last penny .
40005027	» You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall not commit adultery . ’
40005028	But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye causes you to sin , pluck it out and throw it away . It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .
40005030	And if your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell .
40005031	» It has also been said , ‘ Whoever divorces his wife , let him give her a certificate of divorce . ’
40005032	But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife , except on the ground of unchastity , causes her to become an adulteress ; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40005033	» Again you have heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not swear falsely , but shall perform your oaths to the Lord . ’
40005034	But I say to you , do not swear at all : either by heaven , for it is God’s throne ;
40005035	or by the earth , for it is his footstool ; or by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the Great King .
40005036	And do not swear by your head , for you cannot make even one hair white or black .
40005037	Simply let your ‘ Yes ’ be ‘ Yes , ’ and your ‘ No , ’ ‘ No ’ ; anything more than this comes from evil .
40005038	» You have heard that it was said , ‘ An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . ’
40005039	But I tell you , do not resist an evil person . But if someone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also .
40005040	And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic , let him have your cloak as well .
40005041	And if someone forces you to go one mile , go with him two miles .
40005042	Give to him who asks you , and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away .
40005043	» You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
40005044	But I say to you , love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	that you may be sons of your Father in heaven ; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good , and sends rain on the just and on the unjust .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward have you ? Do not even the tax collectors do the same ?
40005047	And if you greet only your brethren , what more are you doing than others ? Do not even the Gentiles do the same ?
40005048	You , therefore , must be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect .
40006001	» Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men , to be seen by them . If you do , you will have no reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	» Thus , when you give alms , do not sound a trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may be praised by men . Truly , I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006003	But when you give to the needy , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your charitable deed may be in secret ; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40006005	» And when you pray , you shall not be like the hypocrites . For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners , that they may be seen by men . Truly , I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006006	But when you pray , go into your room , shut the door and pray to your Father , who is in secret ; and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006007	And when you pray , do not use empty repetitions as the Gentiles do . For they think that they will be heard for their many words .
40006008	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
40006009	Pray , then , in this way : Our Father in heaven , hallowed be your name .
40006010	
40006011	
40006012	
40006013	
40006014	For if you forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
40006016	» And when you fast , do not look gloomy , like the hypocrites , for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting . Truly , I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006017	But when you fast , anoint your head and wash your face ,
40006018	so that you do not appear to be fasting to men , but to your Father who is in secret ; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40006019	» Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal ,
40006020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal .
40006021	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
40006022	The lamp of the body is the eye . So if your eye is good , your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eye is bad , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the light in you is darkness , how great is that darkness !
40006024	No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and mammon .
40006025	» Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat or what you will drink ; nor about your body , what you will put on . Is not life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
40006026	Look at the birds of the air : they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not of more value than they ?
40006027	Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his span of life ?
40006028	And why do you worry about clothing ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they neither toil nor spin ,
40006029	yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
40006030	Now if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today is , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , will he not much more clothe you , O you of little faith ?
40006031	Therefore do not worry , saying , ‘ What shall we eat ? ’ or ‘ What shall we drink ? ’ or ‘ What shall we wear ? ’
40006032	For the Gentiles seek after all these things ; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all .
40006033	But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness , and all these things shall be given to you as well .
40006034	Therefore do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will worry about itself . Sufficient for the day is its own trouble .
40007001	» Judge not , that you be not judged .
40007002	For with the same judgment you judge others , you will be judged , and with the measure you use , it will be measured to you .
40007003	And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye , but do not consider the plank in your own eye ?
40007004	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me take the speck out of your eye , ’ when there is a plank in your own eye ?
40007005	You hypocrite , first take the plank out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye .
40007006	Do not give what is holy to the dogs ; do not throw your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you in pieces .
40007007	» Ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .
40007009	Or what man of you , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
40007011	If you then , who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
40007012	So whatever you wish that men would do to you , do also to them , for this is the Law and the Prophets .
40007013	» Enter by the narrow gate ; for the gate is wide , and the way is broad that leads to destruction , and many are those who enter by it .
40007014	For the gate is narrow and the way is hard , that leads to life , and few are those who find it .
40007015	» Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep’s clothing , but inwardly they are ravenous wolves .
40007016	You will know them by their fruits . Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes , or figs from thistles ?
40007017	Even so , every good tree bears good fruit , but a bad tree bears bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree cannot bear bad fruit , nor can a bad tree bear good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	Thus you will know them by their fruits .
40007021	» Not every one who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
40007022	On that day many will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and cast out demons in your name , and do many mighty works in your name ? ’
40007023	And then will I declare to them , ‘ I never knew you ; depart from me , you evildoers ! ’
40007024	» Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock .
40007025	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat upon that house , but it did not fall , because it had been founded on the rock .
40007026	And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand ;
40007027	and the rain descended , the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell . And great was its fall . «
40007028	And when Jesus had finished these sayings , the crowds were astonished at his teaching ,
40007029	for he taught them as one who had authority , and not as their scribes .
40008001	When he came down from the mountain , great crowds followed him .
40008002	And behold , a leper came and knelt before him , saying , » Lord , if you are willing , you can make me clean . «
40008003	Then Jesus put out his hand and touched him , saying , » I am willing ; be clean . « Immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40008004	And Jesus said to him , » See that you tell no one ; but go your way , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . «
40008005	When Jesus had entered Capernaum , a centurion came to him , asking for help ,
40008006	and saying , » Lord , my servant is lying paralyzed at home , in terrible distress . «
40008007	And Jesus said to him , » I will come and heal him . «
40008008	But the centurion answered him , » Lord , I am not worthy to have you come under my roof . But only say the word , and my servant will be healed .
40008009	For I also am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . And I say to this one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . «
40008010	When Jesus heard him , he marveled , and said to those who followed him , » Truly , I say to you , not even in Israel have I found such great faith .
40008011	I say to you that many will come from east and west , and sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness . There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . «
40008013	Then to the centurion Jesus said , » Go ; be it done for you as you have believed . « And his servant was healed at that very hour .
40008014	When Jesus come into Peter’s house , he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she rose and served him .
40008016	When evening had come , they brought to him many who were demon-possessed . And he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick .
40008017	This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah : » He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases . «
40008018	Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him , he gave orders to go over to the other side .
40008019	Then a certain scribe came and said to him , » Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . «
40008020	And Jesus said to him , » Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . «
40008021	Another of the disciples said to him , » Lord , let me first go and bury my father . «
40008022	But Jesus said to him , » Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead . «
40008023	And when he got into the boat , his disciples followed him .
40008024	And behold , a great storm arose on the sea , so that the boat was covered with the waves . But he was asleep .
40008025	The disciples went and woke him , saying , » Lord , save us ! We are perishing ! «
40008026	And he said to them , » Why are you afraid , O you of little faith ? « Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm .
40008027	And the men marveled , saying , » What sort of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ? «
40008028	When he had come to the other side , to the country of the Gadarenes , two demon-possessed men met him , coming out of the tombs , exceedingly fierce , so that no one could pass that way .
40008029	And behold , they cried out , » What have you to do with us , O Son of God ? Have you come here to torment us before the time ? «
40008030	Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them .
40008031	And the demons begged him , » If you cast us out , send us away into the herd of swine . «
40008032	And he said to them , » Go . « So they came out and went into the swine ; and behold , the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea , and perished in the water .
40008033	Then those who kept them fled , and they went away into the city and told everything , including what had happened to the demon-possessed men .
40008034	And behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus . And when they saw him , they begged him to leave their region .
40009001	And getting into a boat , he crossed over and came to his own city .
40009002	And behold , they brought to him a paralytic , lying on a bed . And when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic , » Take heart , my son ; your sins are forgiven . «
40009003	And behold , some of the scribes said to themselves , » This man is blaspheming ! «
40009004	But Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said , » Why do you think evil in your hearts ?
40009005	For which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise and walk ’ ?
40009006	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins « — he then said to the paralytic — » Rise , take up your bed and go home . «
40009007	And he rose and went home .
40009008	When the crowds saw it , they were afraid , and they glorified God , who had given such authority to men .
40009009	As Jesus passed on from there , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office ; and he said to him , » Follow me . « And he rose and followed him .
40009010	And as Jesus sat at table in the house , behold , many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
40009011	And when the Pharisees saw this , they said to his disciples , » Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? «
40009012	But when Jesus heard it , he said , » Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick .
40009013	But go and learn what this means : ‘ I desire mercy , and not sacrifice . ’ For I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners . «
40009014	Then the disciples of John came to him , saying , » Why do we and the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? «
40009015	And Jesus said to them , » Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn as long as he is with them ? The days will come , when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , for the patch pulls away from the garment , and the tear is made worse .
40009017	Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins ; if they do , the skins burst , and the wine is spilled , and the skins are ruined . But they put new wine into new wineskins , and so both are preserved . «
40009018	While he was saying these things to them , behold , a ruler came and knelt before him , saying , » My daughter has just died , but come and lay your hand on her and she will live . «
40009019	So Jesus rose and followed him , and so did his disciples .
40009020	And behold , a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment .
40009021	For she said to herself , » If I only touch his garment , I shall be made well . «
40009022	Jesus turned , and when he saw her he said , » Take heart , daughter ; your faith has made you well . « And the woman was made well from that moment .
40009023	When Jesus came to the ruler’s house , and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd ,
40009024	he said , » Depart ; for the girl is not dead but sleeping . « And they laughed at him .
40009025	But when the crowd had been put outside , he went in and took her by the hand , and the girl arose .
40009026	And the report of this went through all that region .
40009027	And as Jesus passed on from there , two blind men followed him , crying out , » Have mercy on us , Son of David . «
40009028	When he had entered the house , the blind men came to him ; and Jesus said to them , » Do you believe that I am able to do this ? « They said to him , » Yes , Lord . «
40009029	Then he touched their eyes , saying , » According to your faith be it done to you . «
40009030	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus sternly warned them , » See that no one knows it . «
40009031	But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region .
40009032	As they were going out , behold , a mute and demon-possessed man was brought to him .
40009033	And when the demon had been cast out , the mute man spoke ; and the crowds marveled , saying , » Never was anything like this seen in Israel . «
40009034	But the Pharisees said , » He casts out demons by the prince of demons . «
40009035	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness .
40009036	When he saw the crowds , he had compassion for them , because they were harassed and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , » The harvest is plentiful , but the laborers are few .
40009038	Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest . «
40010001	And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every disease and every sickness .
40010002	The names of the twelve apostles are these : first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Zealot , and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
40010005	These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them : » Do not go among the Gentiles , or enter any town of the Samaritans .
40010006	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	And preach as you go , saying , ‘ The kingdom of heaven is at hand . ’
40010008	Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out demons . Freely you have received , freely give .
40010009	Take no gold , nor silver , nor copper in your belts ,
40010010	nor bag for your journey , nor two tunics , nor sandals , nor a staff ; for the worker is worthy of his food .
40010011	Now whatever village or town you enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and stay there until you go out .
40010012	As you enter the house , give it your greeting .
40010013	And if the house is worthy , let your peace come upon it ; but if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you .
40010014	And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words , shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town .
40010015	Truly , I say to you , it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town .
40010016	» Behold , I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves . Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves .
40010017	But beware of men , for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues .
40010018	You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	But when they deliver you up , do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say ; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour ;
40010020	for it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	Now brother will deliver up brother to death , and a father his child ; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death .
40010022	And you will be hated by all for my name’s sake . But he who endures to the end will be saved .
40010023	When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . For truly , I say to you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	» A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his master .
40010025	It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher , and the servant like his master . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more will they call those of his household !
40010026	» So do not fear them . For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known .
40010027	What I tell you in the dark , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in your ear , proclaim on the housetops .
40010028	And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . But rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell .
40010029	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father’s will .
40010030	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	Fear not , therefore ; you are of more value than many sparrows .
40010032	» Therefore whoever acknowledges me before men , him I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven .
40010033	But whoever denies me before men , I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven .
40010034	» Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth . I did not come to bring peace , but a sword .
40010035	For I have come to set a man ‘ against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ;
40010036	
40010037	He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me ;
40010038	and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me .
40010039	He who finds his life will lose it , and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
40010040	» He who receives you receives me , and he who receives me receives him who sent me .
40010041	He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward , and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward .
40010042	And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple , truly , I say to you , he shall not lose his reward . «
40011001	And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples , he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities .
40011002	Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ , he sent word by his disciples
40011003	and said to him , » Are you the One who is to come , or shall we look for another ? «
40011004	And Jesus answered them , » Go and tell John what you hear and see :
40011005	the blind receive their sight and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear , and the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
40011006	And blessed is he who is not offended because of me . «
40011007	As they went away , Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John : » What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40011008	But what did you go out to see ? A man clothed in soft garments ? Indeed , those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses .
40011009	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	For this is he of whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . ’
40011011	Truly , I say to you , among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist ; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence , and men of violence take it by force .
40011013	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
40011014	And if you are willing to accept it , he is the Elijah who is to come .
40011015	He who has ears to hear , let him hear .
40011016	» But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions ,
40011017	
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look , a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ But wisdom is justified by her deeds . «
40011020	Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done , because they did not repent .
40011021	» Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	But I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades . For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
40011024	But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you . «
40011025	At that time Jesus declared , » I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes .
40011026	Yes , Father , for this was your good pleasure .
40011027	» All things have been delivered to me by my Father . No one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him .
40011028	Come to me , all you who labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke upon you , and learn from me ; for I am gentle and lowly in heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
40011030	For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . «
40012001	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath . And his disciples were hungry , and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
40012002	But when the Pharisees saw it , they said to him , » Look , your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . «
40012003	He said to them , » Have you not read what David did , when he was hungry , and those who were with him :
40012004	how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread which was not lawful for him to eat , nor for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
40012005	Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath , and are innocent ?
40012006	I tell you that one greater than the temple is here .
40012007	And if you had known what this means , ‘ I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned the guiltless .
40012008	For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . «
40012009	And he went on from there , and went into their synagogue .
40012010	And behold , there was a man with a withered hand . And they asked him , » Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? « so that they might accuse him .
40012011	He said to them , » What man of you , if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will not lay hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	Of how much more value is a man than a sheep ! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath . «
40012013	Then he said to the man , » Stretch out your hand . « And he stretched it out , and it was restored as whole as the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him , how they might destroy him .
40012015	Jesus , aware of this , withdrew from there . And many followed him , and he healed them all ,
40012016	and ordered them not to make him known .
40012017	This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah :
40012018	
40012019	
40012020	
40012021	
40012022	Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute , and he healed him , so that the mute man both spoke and saw .
40012023	And all the people were amazed and said , » Could this be the Son of David ? «
40012024	But when the Pharisees heard this they said , » It is only by Beelzebub , the prince of demons , that this fellow drives out demons . «
40012025	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them , » Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
40012026	If Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
40012028	But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
40012029	Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man ? And then he will plunder his house .
40012030	He who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters .
40012031	Therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , either in this age or in the age to come .
40012033	» Either make the tree good , and its fruit good ; or make the tree bad , and its fruit bad ; for a tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	You brood of vipers ! how can you speak good , when you are evil ? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks .
40012035	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things , and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things .
40012036	But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken .
40012037	For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . «
40012038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him , » Teacher , we want to see a sign from you . «
40012039	But he answered them , » An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign ; but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish , so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and now one greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	» When an unclean spirit goes out of a man , he goes through dry places , seeking rest , and finds none .
40012044	Then he says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came . ’ And when he comes he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
40012045	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter and dwell there ; and the last state of that man is worse than the first . So shall it also be with this wicked generation . «
40012046	While he was still talking to the people , behold , his mother and brothers stood outside , seeking to speak to him .
40012047	Someone told him , » Your mother and brothers are standing outside , wanting to speak to you . «
40012048	But he replied to the man who told him , » Who is my mother , and who are my brothers ? «
40012049	And stretching out his hand toward his disciples , he said , » Here are my mother and my brothers !
40012050	For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother . «
40013001	That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea .
40013002	And great crowds gathered around him , so that he got into a boat and sat there ; and the whole crowd stood on the shore .
40013003	Then he told them many things in parables , saying : » A sower went out to sow his seed .
40013004	And as he sowed , some seed fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured them .
40013005	Some fell on rocky places , where they did not have much soil , and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of soil .
40013006	But when the sun was up they were scorched , and because they had no root they withered away .
40013007	Other seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them .
40013008	But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop : some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
40013009	He who has ears , let him hear . «
40013010	The disciples came and said to him , » Why do you speak to them in parables ? «
40013011	And he answered them , » To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been given .
40013012	For whoever has , to him will more be given , and he will have abundance ; but whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him .
40013013	This is why I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand .
40013014	In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says : ‘ Hearing you will hear and shall not understand ; and seeing you will see and not perceive .
40013015	
40013016	But blessed are your eyes for they see , and your ears for they hear .
40013017	For truly , I say to you , many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it .
40013018	» Hear then the parable of the sower :
40013019	when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it , the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is the seed sown along the path .
40013020	But he who received the seed on rocky places , this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ;
40013021	yet he has no root in himself , but endures only for a while . And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he falls away .
40013022	Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word , but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful .
40013023	But the one who received seed on the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it , who indeed bears fruit and produces : some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty . «
40013024	Another parable he put forth to them , saying : » The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field ;
40013025	but while men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat , and went away .
40013026	So when the plants sprouted and bore grain , then the weeds appeared also .
40013027	And the servants of the householder came and said to him , ‘ Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? How then has it weeds ? ’
40013028	He said to them , ‘ An enemy has done this . ’ The servants said to him , ‘ Then do you want us to go and gather them up ? ’
40013029	But he said , ‘ No , lest while you gather up the weeds you also root up the wheat with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest ; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers . Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned , but gather the wheat into my barn . ’ «
40013031	Another parable he put forth to them , saying : » The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ;
40013032	it is the smallest of all seeds , but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches . «
40013033	He told them another parable : » The kingdom of heaven is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened . «
40013034	All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables ; and without a parable he did not speak to them .
40013035	So was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet : » I will open my mouth in parables , I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world . «
40013036	Then he left the crowd and went into the house . And his disciples came to him , saying , » Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field . «
40013037	He answered , » He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man ;
40013038	the field is the world , and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom . The weeds are the sons of the evil one ,
40013039	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
40013040	Therefore as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire , so it will be at the end of this age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send out his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil ,
40013042	and will throw them into the furnace of fire , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears , let him hear .
40013044	» Again , the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field , which a man found and hid ; and then in his joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field .
40013045	» Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls ,
40013046	who , when he had found one pearl of great value , went and sold all that he had and bought it .
40013047	» Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind ;
40013048	which , when it was full , they drew it up on the shore ; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels , but threw the bad away .
40013049	So it will be at the end of the age . The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
40013050	and throw them into the furnace of fire , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . «
40013051	Jesus asked , » Have you understood all these things ? « » Yes , « they said to him .
40013052	And he said to them , » Therefore every scribe who has been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old . «
40013053	When Jesus had finished these parables , he moved on from there .
40013054	And coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , » Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works ?
40013055	Is this not the carpenter’s son ? Is not his mother called Mary ? And his brothers James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas ?
40013056	And are not all his sisters with us ? Where then did this man get all these things ? «
40013057	And they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , » A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house . «
40013058	And he did not do many mighty works there , because of their unbelief .
40014001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus ,
40014002	and he said to his servants , » This is John the Baptist , he has risen from the dead ; that is why these powers are at work in him . «
40014003	For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife ,
40014004	because John had said to him , » It is not lawful for you to have her . «
40014005	And though he wanted to put him to death , he feared the people , because they held him to be a prophet .
40014006	But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod ,
40014007	so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask .
40014008	Prompted by her mother , she said , » Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist . «
40014009	And the king was sorry ; but , because of his oaths and his guests , he commanded it to be given to her ;
40014010	so he sent and had John beheaded in prison .
40014011	And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it ; and they went and told Jesus .
40014013	Now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself . But when the crowds heard it , they followed him on foot from the towns .
40014014	When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng ; and he had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
40014015	When it was evening , the disciples came to him and said , » This is a remote place , and it’s already getting late . Send the crowds away , so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food . «
40014016	Jesus said , » They do not need to go away . You give them something to eat . «
40014017	They said to him , » We have only five loaves here and two fish . «
40014018	He said , » Bring them here to me , «
40014019	Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass . And taking the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples ; and the disciples gave them to the multitudes .
40014020	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
40014021	Now those who ate were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side , while he dismissed the multitudes .
40014023	And after he had dismissed the crowds , he went up on the mountain by himself to pray . When evening came , he was there alone ,
40014024	but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land , beaten by the waves ; for the wind was against them .
40014025	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them , walking on the sea .
40014026	But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were terrified , saying , » It is a ghost ! « And they cried out for fear .
40014027	But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying , » Take courage ! It is I ; do not be afraid . «
40014028	And Peter answered him , » Lord , if it is you , command me to come to you on the water . «
40014029	So he said , » Come « . Then Peter got down out of the boat , walked on the water , and came toward Jesus .
40014030	But when he saw the wind , he was afraid , and beginning to sink he cried out , » Lord , save me ! «
40014031	Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him , and said to him , » O you of little faith , why did you doubt ? «
40014032	And when they got into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	Then those who were in the boat worshipped him , saying , » Truly you are the Son of God . «
40014034	When they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret .
40014035	And when the men of that place recognized him , they sent to all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick ,
40014036	and begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment ; and as many as touched it were made well .
40015001	Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said ,
40015002	» Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat . «
40015003	He answered them , » And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ?
40015004	For God commanded , ‘ Honor your father and your mother ’ ; and , ‘ He who curses father or mother , let him be put to death . ’
40015005	But you say that if a man says to his father or mother , ‘ Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God ’
40015006	he is not to honor his father with it . Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition .
40015007	You hypocrites ! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you , when he said :
40015008	
40015009	
40015010	And he called the people to him and said to them , » Hear and understand :
40015011	not what goes into the mouth defiles a man , but what comes out of the mouth , this defiles a man . «
40015012	Then the disciples came and said to him , » Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying ? «
40015013	He answered , » Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up .
40015014	Let them alone ; they are blind guides . And if a blind man leads a blind man , both will fall into a pit . «
40015015	But Peter said to him , » Explain the parable to us . «
40015016	So Jesus said , » Are you also still without understanding ?
40015017	Do you not yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated ?
40015018	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart , and they defile a man .
40015019	For out of the heart come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , fornications , theft , false witness , slander .
40015020	These are what defile a man ; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man . «
40015021	And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	And behold , a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried to him , » Have mercy on me , O Lord , Son of David ! My daughter is severely demon-possessed . «
40015023	But he did not answer her a word . And his disciples came and urged him , saying , » Send her away , for she is crying out after us . «
40015024	He answered , » I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . «
40015025	But she came and knelt before him , saying , » Lord , help me ! «
40015026	And he answered , » It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . «
40015027	» Yes , Lord , « she said , » yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table . «
40015028	Then Jesus answered her , » O woman , great is your faith ! Be it done for you as you desire . « And her daughter was healed from that very hour .
40015029	And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee . And he went up on the mountain , and sat down there .
40015030	Then great crowds came to him , bringing with them the lame , the maimed , the blind , the mute , and many others ; and they laid them down at his feet , and he healed them .
40015031	So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking , the maimed made whole , the lame walking , and the blind seeing ; and they glorified the God of Israel .
40015032	Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said , » I have compassion on the multitude , because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat . And I do not want to send them away hungry , lest they faint on the way . «
40015033	Then his disciples said to him , » Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd ? «
40015034	And Jesus said to them , » How many loaves do you have ? « They said , » Seven , and a few small fish . «
40015035	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground .
40015036	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish , and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
40015037	And they all ate and were satisfied ; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
40015038	Now those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
40015039	And he sent away the crowds , got into the boat , and went to the region of Magadan .
40016001	Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came , and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	He answered them , » When it is evening , you say , ‘ It will be fair weather ; for the sky is red . ’
40016003	And in the morning , ‘ It will be stormy today , for the sky is red and threatening . ’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky , but you cannot interpret the signs of the times .
40016004	A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign , but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah . « So he left them and departed .
40016005	When the disciples reached the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
40016006	Then Jesus said to them , » Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees . «
40016007	And they discussed among themselves , saying , » It is because we have taken no bread . «
40016008	But Jesus , aware of this , said , » O men of little faith , why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread ?
40016009	Do you not yet perceive ? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets you gathered ?
40016010	Or the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets you gathered ?
40016011	How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread ? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . «
40016012	Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , » Who do men say that the Son of Man is ? «
40016014	And they said , » Some say John the Baptist , others say Elijah , and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets . «
40016015	He said to them , » But who do you say that I am ? «
40016016	Simon Peter answered , » You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . «
40016017	And Jesus answered him , » Blessed are you , Simon Bar-Jonah ! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my Father who is in heaven .
40016018	And I tell you , that you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my church , and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven . «
40016020	Then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem , and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised on the third day .
40016022	Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying , » Never , Lord ! This shall never happen to you ! «
40016023	But he turned and said to Peter , » Get behind me , Satan ! You are a stumbling block to me ; for you are not mindful of the things of God , but the things of men . «
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , » If anyone would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me .
40016025	For whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it .
40016026	What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world , and forfeits his soul ? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul ?
40016027	For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father , and then he will reward each man according to what he has done .
40016028	Truly , I say to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . «
40017001	After six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John his brother , and led them up a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	And he was transfigured before them . His face shone like the sun , and his clothes became as white as the light .
40017003	And behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , talking with him .
40017004	And Peter said to Jesus , » Lord , it is good for us to be here ; if you wish , I will make here three tabernacles — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . «
40017005	While he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them ; and a voice from the cloud said , » This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . Listen to him ! «
40017006	When the disciples heard this , they fell on their faces , and were filled with awe .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them and said , » Rise . Don’t be afraid . «
40017008	And when they lifted up their eyes , they saw no one but Jesus only .
40017009	And as they were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them , » Tell no one the vision , until the Son of Man is raised from the dead . «
40017010	And the disciples asked him , » Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? «
40017011	Jesus replied , » Elijah is coming first and will restore all things .
40017012	But I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished . So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands . «
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist .
40017014	And when they came to the crowd , a man came up to him and kneeling before him said ,
40017015	» Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly ; for often he falls into the fire , and often into the water .
40017016	And I brought him to your disciples , but they could not heal him . «
40017017	Then Jesus answered , » O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I bear with you ? Bring him here to me . «
40017018	And Jesus rebuked the demon , and it came out of him , and the boy was cured from that moment .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said , » Why could we not cast it out ? «
40017020	So he said to them , » Because of your little faith . For truly , I say to you , if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you . «
40017022	Now while they were staying in Galilee , Jesus said to them , » The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men ,
40017023	and they will kill him , and he will be raised on the third day . « And they were greatly distressed .
40017024	When they came to Capernaum , the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said , » Does not your teacher pay the temple tax ? «
40017025	He said , » Yes . « And when he came into the house , Jesus spoke to him first , saying , » What do you think , Simon ? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes , from their sons or from others ? «
40017026	And when Peter said , » From others , « Jesus said to him , » Then the sons are free .
40017027	Nevertheless , so that we may not offend them , go to the sea , cast in a hook , and take the fish that comes up first . And when you open its mouth , you will find a piece of money ; take that and give it to them for me and you . «
40018001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus , saying , » Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? «
40018002	He called to him a little child , and put him in the midst of them ,
40018003	and he said , » Truly , I say to you , unless you turn and become like little children , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Therefore , whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	Whoever receives one little child like this in my name receives me .
40018006	» But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea .
40018007	Woe to the world because of temptations to sin ! For temptations must come , but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes !
40018008	And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire .
40018009	And if your eye causes you to sin , pluck it out and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell .
40018010	» See that you do not despise one of these little ones . For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
40018012	What do you think ? If a man has a hundred sheep , and one of them has gone astray , does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains in search of the one that went astray ?
40018013	And if he finds it , truly , I say to you , he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray .
40018014	So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
40018015	» If your brother sins against you , go and tell him his fault , between you and him alone . If he listens to you , you have gained your brother .
40018016	But if he will not listen , take one or two others along with you , so that ‘ every matter may be established by the word of two or three witnesses . ’
40018017	If he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the church ; and if he refuses to listen even to the church , let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector .
40018018	» Truly , I say to you , whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven .
40018019	Again I say to you , that if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them . «
40018021	Then Peter came to him and said , » Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? Up to seven times ? «
40018022	Jesus said to him , » I do not say to you seven times , but seventy times seven .
40018023	Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants .
40018024	When he began the settlement , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents .
40018025	And as he was not able to pay , his master ordered that he be sold , with his wife and children and all that he had , and payment to be made .
40018026	So the servant fell on his knees before him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me , and I will pay you everything . ’
40018027	The master of that servant took pity on him , released him , and forgave him the debt .
40018028	But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii ; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat , saying , ‘ Pay me what you owe . ’
40018029	So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , ‘ Have patience with me , and I will pay you back . ’
40018030	But he refused , and went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt .
40018031	When his fellow servants saw what had taken place , they were greatly distressed , and went and told their master all that had happened .
40018032	Then his master , after he had called him , said to him , ‘ You wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me .
40018033	Should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant , just as I had mercy on you ? ’
40018034	And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers to be tortured , until he should pay back all he owed .
40018035	So also my heavenly Father will do to each of you , if you do not forgive your brother from your heart . «
40019001	Now when Jesus had finished these sayings , he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan .
40019002	And large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	Some Pharisees came to him to test him . They asked , » Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason ? «
40019004	And he answered them , » Have you not read that he who made them at the beginning ‘ made them male and female , ’
40019005	and said , ‘ For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh ’ ?
40019006	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore what God has joined together , let man not separate . «
40019007	They said to him , » Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce , and to put her away ? «
40019008	He said to them , » Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses permitted you to divorce your wives , but from the beginning it was not so .
40019009	And I say to you , whoever divorces his wife , except for immorality , and marries another woman commits adultery . «
40019010	The disciples said to him , » If such is the case of a man with his wife , it is better not to marry . «
40019011	But he said to them , » Not all men can accept this saying , but only those to whom it has been given .
40019012	For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb , and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men , and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . He who is able to accept it , let him accept it . «
40019013	Then little children were brought to him that he might put his hands on them and pray , but the disciples rebuked them .
40019014	But Jesus said , » Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them ; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven . «
40019015	And he laid his hands on them and went from there .
40019016	Now behold , one came up and said to him , » Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? «
40019017	And he said to him , » Why do you ask me about what is good ? There is only one who is good . If you want to enter life , keep the commandments . «
40019018	He said to him , » Which ones ? « And Jesus said , » ‘ You shall not murder , you shall not commit adultery , you shall not steal , you shall not bear false witness ,
40019019	honor your father and mother , and , you shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’ «
40019020	The young man said to him , » All these I have kept . What do I still lack ? «
40019021	Jesus said to him , » If you want to be perfect , go , sell what you possess and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . «
40019022	But when the young man heard this , he went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his disciples , » Truly I say to you , it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . «
40019025	When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished , saying , » Who then can be saved ? «
40019026	But Jesus looked at them and said to them , » With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . «
40019027	Then Peter answered him , » Behold , we have left everything and followed you . What then shall we have ? «
40019028	Jesus said to them , » Truly I say to you , at the renewal of all things , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands , for my name’s sake , will receive a hundredfold , and inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many who are first will be last , and the last first .
40020001	» For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
40020002	Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
40020004	and to them he said , ‘ You go into the vineyard too , and whatever is right I will give you . ’ So they went .
40020005	Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour , and did the same thing .
40020006	And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle , and said to them , ‘ Why have you been standing here idle all day ? ’
40020007	They said to him , ‘ Because no one has hired us . ’ He said to them , ‘ You also go into the vineyard , and whatever is right you will receive . ’
40020008	And when evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his steward , ‘ Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning with the last , up to the first . ’
40020009	And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour , they each received a denarius .
40020010	So when the first came , they thought they would receive more ; but each of them also received a denarius .
40020011	And when they had received it , they complained against the landowner ,
40020012	saying , ‘ These last men have worked only one hour , and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day . ’
40020013	But he answered one of them , ‘ Friend , I am doing you no wrong . Did you not agree with me for a denarius ?
40020014	Take what is yours and go your way . I wish to give to this last man the same as I gave to you .
40020015	Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own money ? Or are you envious because I am generous ? ’
40020016	So the last will be first , and the first will be last . «
40020017	Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside , and on the way he said to them ,
40020018	» Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes ; and they will condemn him to death ,
40020019	and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified , and he will be raised on the third day . «
40020020	Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons and , kneeling down , asked something of him .
40020021	And he said to her , » What do you want ? « She said to him , » Grant that these two sons of mine may sit , one at your right hand and one at your left , in your kingdom . «
40020022	But Jesus answered , » You do not know what you are asking for . Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink ? « They said to him , » We are able . «
40020023	He said to them , » You will indeed drink my cup , but to sit at my right or my left is not mine to grant , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father . «
40020024	And when the ten heard it , they were indignant with the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them to him and said , » You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great men exercise authority over them .
40020026	Yet it shall not be so among you ; but whoever desires to become great among you must be your servant .
40020027	And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave —
40020028	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . «
40020029	And as they went out of Jericho , a great crowd followed him .
40020030	And behold , two blind men sitting by the roadside , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , » Lord , have mercy on us , Son of David ! «
40020031	The crowd rebuked them , telling them to be quiet ; but they cried out all the more , » Lord , have mercy on us , Son of David ! «
40020032	And Jesus stopped and called them , saying , » What do you want me to do for you ? »
40020033	They said to him , » Lord , let our eyes be opened . «
40020034	And Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes . Immediately they received their sight and followed him .
40021001	Now when they drew near Jerusalem , and came to Bethphage , at the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	saying to them , » Go into the village opposite you , and immediately you will find a donkey tied , and a colt with her . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If any one says anything to you , you shall say , ‘ The Lord has need of them , ’ and he will send them immediately . «
40021004	This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet , saying :
40021005	
40021006	The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt , placed their cloaks on them , and Jesus sat on them .
40021008	And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road , while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	The crowds that went before him and those that followed shouted , » Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! «
40021010	And when he entered Jerusalem , all the city was stirred , saying , » Who is this ? «
40021011	So the crowds said , » This is Jesus , the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee . «
40021012	And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple , and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves .
40021013	And he said to them , » It is written , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer , ’ but you have made it a ‘ den of robbers . ’ «
40021014	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying out in the temple , » Hosanna to the Son of David ! « they were indignant ;
40021016	and they said to him , » Do you hear what these are saying ? « And Jesus said to them , » Yes . Have you never read , ‘ Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants you have perfected praise ’ ? «
40021017	Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany , and he lodged there .
40021018	In the morning , as he was returning to the city , he was hungry .
40021019	And seeing a fig tree by the road he went to it , and found nothing on it but leaves only . And he said to it , » May no fruit ever come from you again ! « And immediately the fig tree withered .
40021020	And when the disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , » How did the fig tree wither away so soon ? «
40021021	And Jesus answered them , » Truly , I say to you , if you have faith and do not doubt , you will not only do what was done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and cast into the sea , ’ it will be done .
40021022	And whatever you ask in prayer , you will receive , if you have faith . «
40021023	And when he entered the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching , and said , » By what authority are you doing these things , and who gave you this authority ? «
40021024	Jesus answered them , » I also will ask you one question ; and if you tell me the answer , then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021025	The baptism of John — where was it from ? From heaven or from men ? « And they reasoned among themselves , saying , » If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
40021026	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we are afraid of the multitude ; for all hold that John was a prophet . «
40021027	So they answered Jesus , » We do not know . « And he said to them , » Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021028	» What do you think ? A man had two sons ; and he went to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work in the vineyard today . ’
40021029	He answered , ‘ I will not , ’ but afterward he regretted it and went .
40021030	Then he went to the second and said the same thing . And he answered , ‘ I go , sir , ’ but he did not go .
40021031	Which of the two did the will of his father ? « They said , » The first . « Jesus said to them , » Truly , I say to you , the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
40021032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him , but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him ; and even when you saw it , you did not afterward repent and believe him .
40021033	» Hear another parable : there was a landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it , dug a wine press in it and built a tower . And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country .
40021034	When the harvest time drew near , he sent his servants to the tenants , to get his fruit .
40021035	And the tenants took his servants , beat one , killed one , and stoned another .
40021036	Again he sent other servants , more than the first , and they did the same to them .
40021037	Last of all , he sent his son to them saying , ‘ They will respect my son , ’
40021038	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him and seize his inheritance . ’
40021039	So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him .
40021040	Therefore , when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? «
40021041	They said to him , » He will put those wretches to a miserable death , and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons . «
40021042	Jesus said to them , » Have you never read in the Scriptures : ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone ; this was the Lord’s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ?
40021043	» Therefore I tell you , the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it .
40021044	
40021045	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they perceived that he was speaking about them .
40021046	But when they tried to arrest him , they feared the multitudes , because they held him to be a prophet .
40022001	And again Jesus spoke to them in parables , saying :
40022002	» The kingdom of heaven is like a king who arranged a marriage for his son ,
40022003	and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding ; but they were not willing to come .
40022004	Again , he sent out other servants , saying , ‘ Tell those who are invited , » See , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding . ’ «
40022005	But they made light of it and went off , one to his own farm , another to his business .
40022006	And the rest seized his servants , treated them shamefully , and killed them .
40022007	The king was enraged . He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
40022009	Go therefore to the highways , and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find . ’
40022010	And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found , both bad and good ; so the wedding hall was filled with guests .
40022011	But when the king came in to see the guests , he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment .
40022012	And he said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you get in here without a wedding garment ? ’ And he was speechless .
40022013	Then the king said to the attendants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot , take him away , and cast him into the outer darkness ; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40022014	For many are called , but few are chosen . «
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his talk .
40022016	And they sent their disciples to him , along with the Herodians , saying , » Teacher , we know that you are true , and teach the way of God in truth , and you care for no man ; for you do not regard the position of men .
40022017	Tell us , then , what do you think ? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? «
40022018	But Jesus , aware of their malice , said , » Why are you testing me , you hypocrites ?
40022019	Show me the money for the tax . « And they brought him a denarius .
40022020	And he said to them , » Whose image and inscription is this ? «
40022021	They said , » Caesar’s . « Then he said to them , » Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . «
40022022	When they heard it , they marveled ; and they left him and went away .
40022023	That same day the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him and asked him a question ,
40022024	saying , » Teacher , Moses said that if a man dies , having no children , his brother must marry the widow , and raise up children for his brother .
40022025	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first one married and died , and having no children , he left his wife to his brother .
40022026	So the second also , and the third , down to the seventh .
40022027	After them all , the woman died .
40022028	Therefore , in the resurrection , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had her . «
40022029	But Jesus answered them , » You are wrong , because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
40022031	But as for the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was said to you by God ,
40022032	‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead , but of the living . «
40022033	And when the multitudes heard this , they were astonished at his teaching .
40022034	But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees , they gathered together .
40022035	And one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , to test him .
40022036	» Teacher , which is the great commandment in the Law ? «
40022037	Jesus said to him , » ‘ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind . ’
40022038	This is the great and first commandment .
40022039	And the second is like it : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’
40022040	On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets . «
40022041	While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
40022042	» What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? « They said to him , » The son of David . «
40022043	He said to them , » How is it then that David , inspired by the Spirit , calls him ‘ Lord ’ , saying ,
40022044	
40022045	If David then calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how is he his son ? «
40022046	And no one was able to answer him a word , nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions .
40023001	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples ,
40023002	» The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat .
40023003	So you must observe and do whatever they tell you . But do not do what they do ; for they preach , but do not practice .
40023004	They bind heavy burdens , hard to bear , and lay them on men’s shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with their finger .
40023005	But they do all their works to be seen by men ; for they make their phylacteries broad and the tassels of their garments long .
40023006	And they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues ,
40023007	and greetings in the marketplaces , and to be called by men , ‘ Rabbi . ’
40023008	But you are not to be called ‘ Rabbi , ’ for you have only one Master , and you are all brethren .
40023009	And do not call anyone on earth your ‘ Father , ’ for you have one Father , he who is in heaven .
40023010	Nor are you to be called ‘ Teacher , ’ for you have one Teacher , the Christ .
40023011	He who is greatest among you shall be your servant .
40023012	For whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted .
40023013	» But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men ; for you neither enter yourselves , nor do you allow those who would enter to go in .
40023015	» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you travel land and sea to win a single proselyte , and when he becomes one , you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves .
40023016	» Woe to you , blind guides , who say , ‘ If any one swears by the temple , it is nothing ; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple , he is bound by his oath . ’
40023017	You blind fools ! For which is greater , the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred ?
40023018	And you say , ‘ If anyone swears by the altar , it means nothing ; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it , he is bound by his oath . ’
40023019	You blind men ! For which is greater , the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred ?
40023020	Therefore , he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it .
40023021	And he who swears by the temple , swears by it and by him who dwells in it .
40023022	And he who swears by heaven , swears by the throne of God and by him who sits on it .
40023023	» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you pay tithe of mint and dill and cummin , and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law , justice and mercy and faith . These you ought to have done , without neglecting the others .
40023024	You blind guides , who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel !
40023025	» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish , but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence .
40023026	Blind Pharisee ! First cleanse the inside of the cup and dish , that the outside of them may be clean also .
40023027	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you are like whitewashed tombs which outwardly appear beautiful , but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness .
40023028	Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men , but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
40023029	» Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous ,
40023030	And you say , ‘ If we had lived in the days of our forefathers , we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets . ’
40023031	Thus you witness against yourselves , that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers’ guilt .
40023033	You serpents ! You brood of vipers , how are you to escape being sentenced to hell ?
40023034	Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes . Some of them you will kill and crucify , and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town ,
40023035	that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah , son of Berechiah , whom you murdered between the temple and the altar .
40023036	Truly , I say to you , all this will come upon this generation .
40023037	» O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you ! How often I have longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you were not willing !
40023038	Behold , your house is left to you desolate .
40023039	For I tell you , you will not see me again , until you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . ’ «
40024001	Jesus left the temple and was going away , when his disciples came up to point out to him the buildings of the temple .
40024002	But he answered them , » You see all these things , do you not ? Truly , I say to you , there will not be left here one stone upon another , that will not be thrown down . «
40024003	Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately , saying , » Tell us , when will this be ? And what will be the sign of your coming , and of the end of the age ? «
40024004	And Jesus answered them : » Take heed that no one deceives you .
40024005	For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Christ , ’ and will deceive many .
40024006	And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars . See that you are not alarmed ; for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
40024007	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places .
40024008	All these are the beginning of birth pains .
40024009	Then they will deliver you up to tribulation , and put you to death ; and you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake .
40024010	And then many will fall away , and will betray one another , and hate one another .
40024011	And many false prophets will rise up and deceive many .
40024012	And because wickedness will increase , the love of most will grow cold .
40024013	But he who endures to the end will be saved .
40024014	And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations , and then the end will come .
40024015	» So when you see standing in the holy place ‘ the abomination of desolation , ’ spoken of by the prophet Daniel ( let the reader understand )
40024016	then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
40024017	Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house .
40024018	And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes .
40024019	But woe for those who are pregnant and for those who are nursing babies in those days !
40024020	Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath .
40024021	For then there will be great tribulation , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , and never will be .
40024022	And if those days had not been shortened , no flesh would be saved ; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened .
40024023	Then if any one says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or ‘ There he is ! ’ do not believe it .
40024024	For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
40024025	See , I have told you beforehand .
40024026	So if they say to you , ‘ There he is , out in the desert , ’ do not go out ; or , ‘ Here he is , in the inner rooms , ’ do not believe it .
40024027	For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west , so also will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40024028	Wherever the carcass is , there the eagles will be gathered together .
40024029	» Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ; the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
40024030	Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven , and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40024031	And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call , and they will gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
40024032	» Now learn this lesson from the fig tree : as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves , you know that summer is near .
40024033	So also , when you see all these things , you know that it is near , right at the door .
40024034	Truly , I say to you , this generation will not pass away till all these things take place .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
40024036	» But of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the Son , but the Father only .
40024037	But as the days of Noah were , so also will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40024038	For as in the days before the flood , they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered the ark ,
40024039	and they did not know until the flood came and took them all away , so also will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40024040	Then two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and the other left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding at the mill ; one will be taken and the other left .
40024042	Watch therefore , for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming .
40024043	But know this , that if the owner of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into .
40024044	Therefore you also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect .
40024045	» Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his master has set over his household , to give them their food at the proper time ?
40024046	Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing .
40024047	Truly , I say to you , he will set him over all his possessions .
40024048	But if that servant is wicked and says to himself , ‘ My master is staying away a long time , ’
40024049	and he then begins to beat his fellow servants , and to eat and drink with the drunkards ,
40024050	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of ,
40024051	and he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40025001	» Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
40025003	For when the foolish took their lamps , they took no oil with them ;
40025004	but the wise took oil in their flasks with their lamps .
40025005	While the bridegroom was delayed , they all slumbered and slept .
40025006	But at midnight there was a cry : ‘ Behold , the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him . ’
40025007	Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	And the foolish said to the wise , ‘ Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . ’
40025009	But the wise replied , ‘ No , there may not be enough for both us and you ; go rather to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves . ’
40025010	And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding ; and the door was shut .
40025011	Afterward the other virgins came also , saying , ‘ Lord , lord , open to us ! ’
40025012	But he replied , ‘ Truly , I say to you , I do not know you . ’
40025013	Therefore keep watch , for you know neither the day nor the hour .
40025014	» For it will be like a man going on a journey , who called his servants and entrusted his property to them .
40025015	To one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one , to each according to his ability . Then he went on his journey .
40025016	He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them ; and he made five talents more .
40025017	So also , he who had the two talents gained two more .
40025018	But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground , and hid his master’s money .
40025019	Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them .
40025020	So he who had received the five talents came and brought five other talents , saying , ‘ Master , you delivered to me five talents ; look , I have gained five more talents . ’
40025021	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant ; you have been faithful over a few things , I will make you ruler over many things . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025022	He also who had received the two talents came and said , ‘ Master , you delivered to me two talents ; look , I have gained two more talents . ’
40025023	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant ; you have been faithful over a few things , I will make you ruler over many things . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025024	Then he who had received the one talent came and said , ‘ Master , I knew you to be a hard man , reaping where you have not sown , and gathering where you have not scattered seed .
40025025	So I was afraid , and went and hid your talent in the ground . Here you have what is yours . ’
40025026	But his master answered him , ‘ You wicked and lazy servant ! You knew that I reap where I have not sown , and gather where I have not scattered seed ?
40025027	Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers , and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest .
40025028	Therefore take the talent from him , and give it to him who has the ten talents .
40025029	For to every one who has will more be given , and he will have abundance ; but from him who does not have , even what he has will be taken away .
40025030	And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness . There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40025031	» When the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then he will sit on his glorious throne .
40025032	All the nations will be gathered before him , and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	And he will put the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
40025034	Then the King will say to those on his right hand , ‘ Come , you blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
40025035	for I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me drink , I was a stranger and you took me in ,
40025036	I was naked and you clothed me , I was sick and you visited me , I was in prison and you came to me . ’
40025037	Then the righteous will answer him , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you drink ?
40025038	When did we see you a stranger and take you in , or naked and clothe you ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you ? ’
40025040	And the King will answer them , ‘ Truly , I say to you , as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren , you did it to me . ’
40025041	» Then he will say to those on his left hand , ‘ Depart from me , you who are cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels :
40025042	for I was hungry and you gave me no food , I was thirsty and you gave me no drink ,
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not take me in , naked and you did not clothe me , sick and in prison and you did not visit me . ’
40025044	Then they also will answer , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not minister to you ? ’
40025045	Then he will answer them , ‘ Truly , I say to you , as you did not do it to one of the least of these , you did not do it to me . ’
40025046	And they will go away into eternal punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . «
40026001	When Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	» You know that after two days is the Passover , and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified . «
40026003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
40026004	and they plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him .
40026005	But they said , » Not during the feast , lest there be a riot among the people . «
40026006	Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume , and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table .
40026008	But when the disciples saw it , they were indignant , saying , » Why this waste ?
40026009	For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and given to the poor . «
40026010	But Jesus , aware of this , said to them , » Why do you trouble the woman ? For she has done a beautiful thing to me .
40026011	For you always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me .
40026012	For in pouring this perfume on my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
40026013	Truly , I say to you , wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world , what she has done will also be told in memory of her . «
40026014	Then one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
40026015	and said , » What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you ? « And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver .
40026016	And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him .
40026017	Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying , » Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? «
40026018	He said , » Go into the city to a certain man , and say to him , ‘ The Teacher says , my time is at hand ; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples . ’ «
40026019	So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them ; and they prepared the Passover .
40026020	When evening had come , he sat at the table with the twelve .
40026021	And as they were eating , he said , » Truly , I say to you , one of you will betray me . «
40026022	And they were very sorrowful , and began to say to him one after another , » Is it I , Lord ? «
40026023	He answered , » He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man goes just as it is written of him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born . «
40026025	Then Judas , who was betraying him , answered , » Rabbi , is it I ? « He said to him , » You have said it . «
40026026	Now as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and broke it , and gave it to the disciples and said , » Take , eat ; this is my body . «
40026027	Then he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , » Drink from it , all of you .
40026028	For this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	I tell you , I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom . «
40026030	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , » You will all fall away because of me this night ; for it is written , ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ’
40026032	But after I have been raised , I will go before you to Galilee . «
40026033	Peter declared to him , » Even if all fall away because of you , I will never fall away . «
40026034	Jesus said to him , » Truly I say to you , this very night , before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . «
40026035	Peter said to him , » Even if I have to die with you , I will not deny you . « And so said all the disciples .
40026036	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to them , » Sit here while I go over there and pray . «
40026037	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him , and he began to be sorrowful and troubled .
40026038	Then he said to them , » My soul is exceedingly sorrowful , even to death . Stay here and watch with me . «
40026039	And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed , » O my Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass from me ; nevertheless , not as I will , but as you will . «
40026040	Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping ; and he said to Peter , » So , could you not watch with me one hour ?
40026041	Watch and pray , so that you will not enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . «
40026042	Again , a second time , he went away and prayed , » O my Father , if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it , your will be done . «
40026043	And again he came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	So he left them , went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
40026045	Then he came to the disciples and said to them , » Are you still sleeping and resting ? Behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Rise , let us be going ; see , my betrayer is at hand . «
40026047	While he was still speaking , Judas came , one of the twelve , and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and the elders of the people .
40026048	Now the betrayer had given them a sign , saying , » The one I kiss is the man ; seize him . «
40026049	And at once he went up to Jesus and said , » Greetings , Rabbi ! « and kissed him .
40026050	Jesus said to him , » Friend , why are you here ? « Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him .
40026051	And suddenly , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword , struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
40026052	But Jesus said to him , » Put your sword back in its place , for all who take the sword will perish by the sword .
40026053	Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father , and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
40026054	But how then could the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must happen in this way ? «
40026055	At that hour Jesus said to the crowds , » Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs to capture me ? Every day I sat in the temple teaching , and you did not seize me .
40026056	But all this has taken place , that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . « Then all the disciples forsook him and fled .
40026057	And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had assembled .
40026058	But Peter followed him at a distance , right up to the courtyard of the high priest . He entered and sat down with the guards to see the end .
40026059	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death ,
40026060	but they found none , though many false witnesses came forward . At last two came forward
40026061	and said , » This fellow said , ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days . ’ «
40026062	And the high priest stood up and said , » Have you no answer to make ? What is it that these men testify against you ? «
40026063	But Jesus remained silent . And the high priest said to him , » I charge you under oath by the living God : tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God . «
40026064	Jesus said to him , » It is as you said . But I say to you , hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power , and coming on the clouds of heaven . «
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , » He has spoken blasphemy ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? Look , now you have heard his blasphemy .
40026066	What do you think ? « They answered , » He is worthy of death . «
40026067	Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists ; and others slapped him ,
40026068	saying , » Prophesy to us , Christ ! Who is the one who struck you ? «
40026069	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard , and a servant girl came to him and said , » You also were with Jesus of Galilee . «
40026070	But he denied it before them all , saying , » I do not know what you are talking about . «
40026071	And when he went out to the gateway , another girl saw him and said to the people there , » This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth . «
40026072	But again he denied it with an oath , » I do not know the man ! «
40026073	After a little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter , » Surely you are also one of them , for your accent betrays you . «
40026074	Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear , » I do not know the man . « And immediately the rooster crowed .
40026075	And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said , » Before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . « So he went out and wept bitterly .
40027001	When morning came , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death .
40027002	And they bound him , and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor .
40027003	When Judas , his betrayer , saw that he was condemned , he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders ,
40027004	saying , » I have sinned by betraying innocent blood . « And they said , » What is that to us ? You see to it ! «
40027005	Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself .
40027006	But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , » It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , since they are the money of blood . «
40027007	So they took counsel , and bought with them the potter’s field , to bury strangers in .
40027008	Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
40027009	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying , » And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel ,
40027010	and they gave them for the potter’s field , as the Lord directed me . «
40027011	Now Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , » Are you the king of the Jews ? « So Jesus said to him , » It is as you say . «
40027012	But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he made no answer .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , » Do you not hear how many things they testify against you ? «
40027014	But he gave him no answer , not even to a single charge ; so that the governor wondered greatly .
40027015	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted .
40027016	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner , called Barabbas .
40027017	So when they had gathered , Pilate said to them , » Whom do you want me to release for you , Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ? «
40027018	For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed him over .
40027019	While he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent word to him , » Have nothing to do with that righteous man , for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him . «
40027020	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus .
40027021	The governor answered them , » Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? « They said , » Barabbas ! «
40027022	Pilate said to them , » Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? « They all said , » Let him be crucified ! «
40027023	And he said , » Why , what evil has he done ? « But they shouted all the more , » Let him be crucified ! «
40027024	When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing , but rather that a riot was starting , he took water and washed his hands before the crowd , saying , » I am innocent of this man’s blood . See to it yourselves . «
40027025	And all the people answered , » His blood be on us and on our children ! «
40027026	Then he released Barabbas to them ; and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
40027027	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him .
40027028	And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him ,
40027029	and when they had twisted a crown of thorns , they put it on his head , and a reed in his right hand . And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him , saying , » Hail , King of the Jews ! «
40027030	And they spat on him , and took the reed and struck him on the head .
40027031	And when they had mocked him , they took the robe off him , put his own clothes on him , and led him away to crucify him .
40027032	Now as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name , and they compelled him to carry his cross .
40027033	And when they came to a place called Golgotha ( which means the place of a skull ) ,
40027034	they offered him wine to drink , mingled with gall ; but when he tasted it , he would not drink it .
40027035	And when they had crucified him , they divided his garments among them by casting lots ;
40027036	and sitting down , they kept watch over him there .
40027037	And they put up over his head the charge written against him : THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
40027038	Then two robbers were crucified with him , one on the right and one on the left .
40027039	And those who passed by hurled insults at him , wagging their heads
40027040	and saying , » You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days , save yourself ! If you are the Son of God , come down from the cross . «
40027041	So also the chief priests , with the scribes and elders , mocked him , saying ,
40027042	» He saved others ; he cannot save himself . He is the King of Israel ; let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusts in God ; let God deliver him now , if he desires him ; for he said , ‘ I am the Son of God . ’ «
40027044	And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way .
40027045	Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land .
40027046	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , » Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? « that is , » My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? «
40027047	When some of those standing there heard this , they said , » This man is calling Elijah . «
40027048	Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge , filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a reed , and offered it to him to drink .
40027049	The rest said , » Let him alone ; let us see if Elijah will come to save him . «
40027050	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit .
40027051	And behold , the curtain of the temple was torn in two , from top to bottom ; and the earth shook , and the rocks were split ;
40027052	the tombs also were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised ,
40027053	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection , they went into the holy city and appeared to many .
40027054	So when the centurion and those with him , who were guarding Jesus , saw the earthquake and the things that had happened , they were terrified , and said , » Truly this was the Son of God ! «
40027055	And many women were also there , looking on from afar , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering to him ;
40027056	among whom were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedee’s sons .
40027057	And when it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
40027059	When Joseph took the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
40027060	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out of the rock ; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , and departed .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb .
40027062	The next day , the one after the day of Preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate
40027063	and said , » Sir , we remember how that deceiver said , while he was still alive , ‘ After three days I will rise again . ’
40027064	Therefore order that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night and steal him away , and tell the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead . ’ So the last deception will be worse than the first . «
40027065	Pilate said to them , » You have a guard ; go your way , make it as secure as you know how . «
40027066	So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard .
40028001	Now after the Sabbath , as the first day of the week began to dawn , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb .
40028002	And behold , there was a great earthquake ; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat on it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
40028004	And the guards shook for fear of him , and became like dead men .
40028005	But the angel said to the women , » Do not be afraid , for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here ; for he has risen , as he said . Come , see the place where he lay .
40028007	Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead . And behold , he is going before you to Galilee ; there you will see him . Behold , I have told you . «
40028008	So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	And behold , Jesus met them and said , » Hail ! « And they came to him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , » Do not be afraid . Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee ; and there they will see me . «
40028011	Now while they were going , behold , some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened .
40028012	When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers ,
40028013	and said , » Tell them , ‘ His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep . ’
40028014	And if this comes to the governor’s ears , we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble . «
40028015	So they took the money and did as they were instructed ; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day .
40028016	Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them .
40028017	When they saw him , they worshipped him ; but some doubted .
40028018	And Jesus came and said to them , » All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
40028019	Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you ; and behold , I am with you always , even to the end of the age . «
41001001	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	As it is written in Isaiah the prophet : » Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way « ;
41001003	
41001004	John came baptizing in the wilderness , and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
41001005	And all the land of Judea , and the people from Jerusalem , went out to him and they were all baptized by him in the Jordan River , confessing their sins .
41001006	Now John was clothed with camel's hair , and with a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	And he preached , saying , » After me comes One who is mightier than I , the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie .
41001008	I have baptized you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . «
41001009	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	And immediately coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove .
41001011	And a voice came from heaven , » You are my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . «
41001012	The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness .
41001013	And he was in the wilderness forty days , tempted by Satan ; and he was with the wild beasts , and the angels ministered to him .
41001014	Now after John was put in prison , Jesus came to Galilee , preaching the gospel of God ,
41001015	and saying , » The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand ; repent , and believe in the gospel . «
41001016	And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the Sea ; for they were fishermen .
41001017	And Jesus said to them , » Come follow me , and I will make you become fishers of men . «
41001018	And immediately they left their nets and followed him .
41001019	When he had gone a little farther from there , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the boat mending their nets .
41001020	And immediately he called them ; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and followed him .
41001021	And they went into Capernaum , and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught .
41001022	And they were astonished at his teaching , for he taught them as one who had authority , and not as the scribes .
41001023	Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit . And he cried out ,
41001024	saying , » Let us alone ! What have we to do with you , Jesus of Nazareth ? Did you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God ! «
41001025	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , » Be quiet , and come out of him ! «
41001026	And the unclean spirit , convulsing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
41001027	And they were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , » What is this ? A new teaching ! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . «
41001028	And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee .
41001029	As soon as they left the synagogue , they went with James and John , and entered the house of Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever , and immediately they told him about her .
41001031	So he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up , and immediately the fever left her . And she served them .
41001032	Now at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed .
41001033	And the whole city was gathered together at the door .
41001034	And he healed many who were sick with various diseases , and cast out many demons ; and he would not permit the demons to speak , because they knew him .
41001035	Now in the morning , a long while before daylight , he rose and went out to a solitary place , and there he prayed .
41001036	And Simon and those who were with him searched for him ,
41001037	and when they found him , they said to him , » Everyone is looking for you . «
41001038	And he said to them , » Let us go on to the next towns , so I may preach there also ; for that is why I have come . «
41001039	And he went throughout all Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons .
41001040	Then a leper came to him , imploring him , kneeling down to him and saying to him , » If you are willing , you can make me clean . «
41001041	And Jesus , moved with compassion , put out his hand and touched him , and said to him , » I am willing ; be clean . «
41001042	And immediately the leprosy left him , and he was made clean .
41001043	And he strictly warned him and sent him away at once ,
41001044	and he said to him , » See that you say nothing to anyone ; but go , show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . «
41001045	But he went out and began to talk freely about it , and to spread the news , so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town , but was outside in the deserted places ; and people came to him from every quarter .
41002001	And when he entered Capernaum after some days , it was heard that he was home .
41002002	And many gathered together , so that there was no longer room to receive them , not even near the door . And he preached the word to them .
41002003	Then they came to him , bringing a paralytic carried by four men .
41002004	And when they could not get near him because of the crowd , they made an opening in the roof above him ; and when they had broken through , they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying .
41002005	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , » Son , your sins are forgiven . «
41002006	Now some of the scribes were sitting there , reasoning in their hearts ,
41002007	» Why does this man speak like this ? He is blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? «
41002008	And immediately , when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves , he said to them , » Why do you reason about these things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise , take up your pallet and walk ’ ?
41002010	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins « — he said to the paralytic ,
41002011	» I say to you , rise , take up your pallet and go home . «
41002012	And he rose , and immediately took up the pallet and went out in the sight of them all ; so that they were all amazed and glorified God , saying , » We never saw anything like this ! «
41002013	Then he went out again beside the sea ; and all the crowd came to him , and he taught them .
41002014	As he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office , and he said to him , » Follow me . « So he rose and followed him .
41002015	And as he sat at table in Levi's house , many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples ; for there were many who followed him .
41002016	And the scribes of the Pharisees , when they saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , » Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? «
41002017	And when Jesus heard it , he said to them , » Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick . I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners . «
41002018	Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . And people came and said to him , » Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? «
41002019	And Jesus said to them , » Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
41002020	But the days will come , when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast in that day .
41002021	» No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; if he does , the new piece will pull away from the old , and the tear is made worse .
41002022	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; if he does , the wine will burst the skins , and the wine is lost and the wineskins are ruined . But new wine must be put into new wineskins . «
41002023	One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields ; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain .
41002024	And the Pharisees said to him , » Look , why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath ? «
41002025	But he said to them , » Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry , he and those who were with him :
41002026	how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and ate the consecrated bread , which is not lawful to eat , except for the priests , and also gave some to those who were with him ? «
41002027	And he said to them , » The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath .
41002028	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath . «
41003001	He entered the synagogue again , and a man was there who had a withered hand .
41003002	And they watched him closely , to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath , so that they might accuse him .
41003003	And he said to the man who had the withered hand , » Come here . «
41003004	Then he said to them , » Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? « But they kept silent .
41003005	And he looked around at them with anger , grieved at the hardness of their hearts , and said to the man , » Stretch out your hand . « He stretched it out , and his hand was restored .
41003006	Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
41003007	Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea , and a great multitude from Galilee followed ; also from Judea
41003008	and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they heard how many things he was doing , came to him .
41003009	And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd , lest they should crush him .
41003010	For he had healed many , so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him .
41003011	And whenever the unclean spirits saw him , they fell down before him and cried out , » You are the Son of God . «
41003012	But he strictly ordered them not to make him known .
41003013	And he went up on the mountain , and called to him those he himself wanted . And they came to him .
41003014	Then he appointed twelve , that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach ,
41003015	and to have authority to cast out the demons :
41003016	Simon , to whom he gave the name Peter ;
41003017	James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James , to whom he gave the name Boanerges , that is , » Sons of Thunder « ;
41003018	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot ;
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
41003020	Then he went home ; and the crowd came together again , so that they could not even eat .
41003021	When his family heard about this , they went to take charge of him , for they said , » He is out of his mind . «
41003022	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , » He is possessed by Beelzebub , and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons . «
41003023	So he called them to himself and said to them in parables : » How can Satan cast out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
41003025	And if a house is divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
41003026	And if Satan has risen up against himself , and is divided , he cannot stand , but is coming to an end .
41003027	No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man . And then he will plunder his house .
41003028	Truly , I say to you , all sins will be forgiven the sons of men , and whatever blasphemies they utter ;
41003029	but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin « —
41003030	because they said , » He has an unclean spirit . «
41003031	Then his brothers and his mother came . And standing outside they sent to him , and called him .
41003032	And a crowd was sitting around him ; and they said to him , » Your mother and your brothers are outside , asking for you . «
41003033	And he replied , » Who are my mother and my brothers ? «
41003034	And he looked at those who sat in a circle around him , and said , » Here are my mother and my brothers !
41003035	Whoever does the will of God is my brother , and sister , and mother . «
41004001	Again he began to teach by the sea . and a very large crowd gathered around him , so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea ; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land .
41004002	Then he taught them many things by parables , and said to them in his teaching :
41004003	» Listen ! A sower went out to sow .
41004004	And as he sowed the seed , some fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured it .
41004005	Some fell on rocky ground , where it did not have much soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
41004006	But when the sun came up it was scorched , and because it had no root it withered away .
41004007	Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no grain .
41004008	But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up , increased and produced thirtyfold , sixty , and a hundred . «
41004009	And he said , » He who has ears to hear , let him hear . «
41004010	And when he was alone , those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables .
41004011	And he said to them , » To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God , but to those outside everything is in parables ;
41004012	so that ‘ seeing they may see but not perceive , and hearing may hear but not understand ; lest they should turn again , and be forgiven . ’ «
41004013	And he said to them , » Do you not understand this parable ? How then will you understand all the parables ?
41004014	The sower sows the word .
41004015	And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown . When they hear , Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them .
41004016	And these likewise are the ones sown on rocky ground who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy ;
41004017	and they have no root in themselves , but endure for only a time . Then , when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word , immediately they fall away .
41004018	And others are the ones sown among thorns ; they are those who hear the word ,
41004019	but the cares of this world , the deceitfulness of riches , and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
41004020	But these are the ones sown on good soil , those who hear the word , accept it , and bear fruit thirtyfold , sixty , and a hundred . «
41004021	And he said to them , » Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed ? Is it not to be set on a lampstand ?
41004022	For there is nothing hidden , except to be revealed ; nor is anything secret , but that it should come to light .
41004023	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear . «
41004024	Then he said to them , » Take heed what you hear . With the measure you use , it will be measured to you ; and more will be given you .
41004025	For whoever has , to him will more be given ; and whoever does not have , from him even what he has will be taken away . «
41004026	And he said , » The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground ,
41004027	and should sleep by night and rise by day , and the seed should sprout and grow , he himself does not know how .
41004028	All by itself the earth produces grain — first the blade , then the head , then the full kernel in the head .
41004029	But when the grain is ripe , at once he puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come . «
41004030	And he said , » With what shall we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable shall we use for it ?
41004031	It is like a mustard seed which , when it is sown on the ground , is the smallest of all seeds in the earth ;
41004032	yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs , and puts forth large branches , so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade . «
41004033	With many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it .
41004034	But without a parable he did not speak to them . And when they were alone , he explained everything to his own disciples .
41004035	On that day , when evening had come , he said to them , » Let us go over to the other side . «
41004036	And leaving the crowd , they took him along , just as he was , in the boat . There were also other boats with him .
41004037	And a great storm arose , and the waves beat into the boat , so that it was already filling .
41004038	But he was in the stern , asleep on a cushion . And they woke him and said to him , » Teacher , do you not care if we perish ? «
41004039	Then he rose and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , » Peace ! Be still ! « And the wind ceased and there was a great calm .
41004040	He said to them , » Why are you so afraid ? Have you no faith ? «
41004041	And they were filled with awe , and said to one another , » Who is this ? Even the wind and the sea obey him ! «
41005001	They came to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gerasenes .
41005002	And when he had come out of the boat , there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
41005003	who lived among the tombs ; and no one could bind him any more , not even with a chain ,
41005004	for he had often been bound with shackles and chains . But the chains he wrenched apart , and the shackles he broke in pieces ; and no one had the strength to subdue him .
41005005	Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	And when he saw Jesus from a distance , he ran and worshipped him .
41005007	And crying out with a loud voice , he said , » What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I implore you by God , do not torment me . «
41005008	For he had said to him , » Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! «
41005009	Then Jesus asked him , » What is your name ? « And he replied , » My name is Legion , for we are many . «
41005010	And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country .
41005011	Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside .
41005012	So all the demons begged him , » Send us to the swine , that we may enter them . «
41005013	So he gave them permission . And the unclean spirits came out , and entered the swine ; and the herd , numbering about two thousand , rushed down the steep bank into the sea , and were drowned in the sea .
41005014	So those who fed the swine fled , and told it in the city and in the country . And people went out to see what it was that had happened .
41005015	And they came to Jesus , and saw the man who had been possessed sitting there , clothed and in his right mind , the man who had had the legion ; and they were afraid .
41005016	And those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man , and about the swine .
41005017	Then they began to plead with Jesus to depart from their region .
41005018	And as he was getting into the boat , the man who had been demon-possessed begged him that he might be with him .
41005019	Jesus did not let him , but said , » Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you , and how he has had mercy on you . «
41005020	And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him ; and all men marveled .
41005021	And when Jesus had crossed over again by the boat to the other side , a great crowd gathered around him ; and he was by the sea .
41005022	Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name . And seeing him , he fell at his feet ,
41005023	and pleaded earnestly with him , saying , » My little daughter is at the point of death . Come and lay your hands on her , so that she may be healed , and live . «
41005024	So Jesus went with him . And a great crowd followed him and thronged around him .
41005025	And there was a woman who had endured a flow of blood for twelve years ,
41005026	and she had suffered much under many physicians , and had spent all that she owned , and was no better but rather grew worse .
41005027	When she heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment .
41005028	For she said , » If I touch even his clothes , I shall be made well . «
41005029	And immediately the bleeding stopped ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease .
41005030	And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out from him , turned around in the crowd and said , » Who touched my clothes ? «
41005031	And his disciples said to him , » You see the crowd pressing around you , and yet you say , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ «
41005032	And he looked around to see who had done it .
41005033	But the woman , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell down before him in fear and trembling and told him the whole truth .
41005034	And he said to her , » Daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in peace , and be healed of your disease . «
41005035	While he was still speaking , some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said , » Your daughter is dead . Why trouble the Teacher any further ? «
41005036	But ignoring what they said , Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue , » Do not be afraid ; only believe . «
41005037	And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter , James , and John the brother of James .
41005038	When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , he saw a tumult , and people weeping and wailing loudly .
41005039	And when he came in , he said to them , » Why make this commotion and weep ? The child is not dead , but sleeping . «
41005040	And they laughed at him . But after he put them all outside , he took the child's father and mother and those who were with him , and went in where the child was .
41005041	He took her by the hand and said to her , » Talitha cumi ! « which means , » Little girl , I say to you , arise . «
41005042	Immediately the girl stood up and walked ( she was twelve years of age ) . And they were overcome with great amazement .
41005043	He strictly charged them that no one should know this , and told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	He went away from there and came to his own country , and his disciples followed him .
41006002	And when the Sabbath had come , he began to teach in the synagogue . And many who heard him were astonished , saying , » Where did this man get these things ? And what wisdom is this which is given to him , that such mighty works are performed by his hands !
41006003	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? Are not his sisters here with us ? « And they took offense at him .
41006004	But Jesus said to them , » A prophet is not without honor except in his own country , among his own relatives , and in his own house . «
41006005	Now he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
41006006	And he marveled because of their unbelief . Then he went around the villages teaching .
41006007	And he called to him the twelve , and began to send them out two by two , and gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
41006008	He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff — no bag , no bread , no money in their belts —
41006009	but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics .
41006010	And he said to them , » Where you enter a house , stay there until you leave that place .
41006011	And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you , when you leave , shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them . «
41006012	So they went out and preached that people should repent .
41006013	And they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them .
41006014	King Herod heard of it , for Jesus' name had become well known . Some said , » John the Baptist has been raised from the dead , and that is why these powers are at work in him . «
41006015	But others said , » It is Elijah . « And others said , » It is a prophet , like one of the prophets of old . «
41006016	But when Herod heard , he said , » This is John , whom I beheaded ; he has been raised from the dead ! «
41006017	For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife ; because he had married her .
41006018	For John had said to Herod , » It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife . «
41006019	And Herodias had a grudge against him , and wanted to kill him . But she could not ,
41006020	for Herod feared John and protected him , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man . When he heard him , he was much perplexed ; and yet he heard him gladly .
41006021	But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his high officers and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee .
41006022	And when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced , she pleased Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the girl , » Ask me for whatever you want , and I will give it to you . «
41006023	And he vowed to her , » Whatever you ask me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . «
41006024	So she went out and said to her mother , » What shall I ask ? « And she said , » The head of John the Baptist ! «
41006025	Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked , saying , » I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter . «
41006026	And the king was exceedingly sorry ; but , because of his oaths and his guests , he did not want to refuse her .
41006027	And immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring his head . He went and beheaded him in the prison ,
41006028	and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	When his disciples heard of it , they came and took his body , and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles gathered to Jesus , and told him all that they had done and taught .
41006031	And he said to them , » Come away by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a while . « For there were many coming and going , and they did not even have time to eat .
41006032	So they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves .
41006033	But many saw them going , and knew them , and they ran there on foot from all the towns , and got there ahead of them .
41006034	When Jesus went ashore he saw a great crowd , and he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began to teach them many things .
41006035	When it was late in the day , his disciples came to him and said , » This is a deserted place , and already the hour is late .
41006036	Send them away , so they can go to the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves something to eat . «
41006037	But he answered them , » You give them something to eat . « And they said to him , » Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread , and give it to them to eat ? «
41006038	But he said to them , » How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . « And when they found out they said , » Five , and two fish . «
41006039	Then he commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	So they sat down in groups , of hundreds and fifties .
41006041	And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and broke the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before the people ; and he divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	And they all ate and were satisfied .
41006043	And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish .
41006044	Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men .
41006045	Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he dismissed the crowd .
41006046	And after he had left them , he went up on the mountain to pray .
41006047	When evening came , the boat was in the middle of the sea , and he was alone on land .
41006048	And he saw the disciples straining at the oars , for the wind was against them . About the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea . He was about to pass by them ,
41006049	but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost , and cried out ;
41006050	for they all saw him , and were terrified . But immediately he spoke to them and said , » Take courage ! It is I ; do not be afraid . «
41006051	Then he climbed into the boat with them , and the wind ceased . And they were completely amazed ,
41006052	for they had not understood about the loaves , because their hearts were hardened .
41006053	When they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there .
41006054	And when they got out of the boat , immediately the people recognized him ,
41006055	and ran about that whole region , and began to carry those who were sick around on pallets to wherever they heard he was .
41006056	Wherever he entered , into villages , cities , or the country , they laid the sick in the marketplaces , and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment . And as many as touched him were made well .
41007001	Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered together to him ,
41007002	they saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled , that is , unwashed .
41007003	( For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way , holding the tradition of the elders .
41007004	When they come from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they wash themselves . And there are many other traditions which they observe , the washing of cups and pitchers and copper vessels . )
41007005	The Pharisees and the scribes asked him , » Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders , but eat with impure hands ? «
41007006	And he said to them , » Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites ; as it is written : ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
41007007	
41007008	You let go of the commandment of God , and hold on to the tradition of men . «
41007009	And he said to them , » You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God , in order to keep your tradition !
41007010	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother ’ ; and , ‘ He who curses father or mother , let him be put to death . ’
41007011	But you say that if a man says to his father or mother , ‘ Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban ’ ( that is , a gift devoted to God ) ,
41007012	then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother ,
41007013	thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you have handed down . And many such things you do . «
41007014	And he called all the people to him again , and said to them , » Hear me , everyone , and understand :
41007015	there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him ; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him . «
41007017	When he had left the crowd and entered the house , his disciples asked him about this parable .
41007018	So he said to them , » Are you also without understanding ? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him ,
41007019	since it does not enter his heart but his stomach , and so passes on ? « ( Thus he declared all foods clean . )
41007020	And he said , » What comes out of a man is what defiles a man .
41007021	For from within , out of the heart of men , come evil thoughts , fornications , theft , murder , adultery ,
41007022	coveting , wickedness , deceit , lewdness , envy , slander , pride , foolishness .
41007023	All these evil things come from within , and they defile a man . «
41007024	From there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon . And he entered a house , and did not want anyone to know it ; yet he could not be hidden .
41007025	But a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him , and she came and fell at his feet .
41007026	Now the woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by birth . And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	And he said to her , » Let the children first be fed , for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . «
41007028	But she answered him , » Yes , Lord , yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs . «
41007029	Then he said to her , » For this saying you may go your way ; the demon has left your daughter . «
41007030	She went home , and found her child lying on the bed , and the demon gone .
41007031	Then he departed from the region of Tyre , and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , through the region of the Decapolis .
41007032	Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech , and they begged him to put his hand on him .
41007033	And he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat and touched his tongue .
41007034	And looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him , » Ephphatha , « that is , » Be opened . «
41007035	And immediately his ears were opened , and the impediment of his tongue was loosed , and he spoke plainly .
41007036	And he commanded them to tell no one ; but the more he charged them , the more widely they proclaimed it .
41007037	And they were astonished beyond measure , saying , » He has done all things well . He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak . «
41008001	In those days , when again a great crowd had gathered , and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples to him , and said to them ,
41008002	» I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat .
41008003	And if I send them away hungry to their homes , they will faint on the way ; and some of them have come a long distance . «
41008004	And his disciples answered him , » How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert ? «
41008005	And he asked them , » How many loaves do you have ? « They said , » Seven . «
41008006	So he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground . And he took the seven loaves , and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people ; and they set them before the crowd .
41008007	They also had a few small fish ; and having blessed them , he commanded that these also should be set before them .
41008008	They ate , and were satisfied ; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over .
41008009	About four thousand men were present . And having sent them away ,
41008010	he immediately got into the boat with his disciples , and went to the region of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came and began to argue with him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , to test him .
41008012	And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and said , » Why does this generation seek a sign ? Truly , I say to you , no sign shall be given to this generation . «
41008013	And he left them , and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side .
41008014	Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread , and they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	And he cautioned them , saying , » Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod . «
41008016	And they discussed it with one another , saying , » It is because we have no bread . «
41008017	Being aware of it , Jesus said to them , » Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread ? Do you not yet perceive or understand ? Are your hearts hardened ?
41008018	Having eyes do you not see , and having ears do you not hear ? And do you not remember ?
41008019	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? « They said to him , » Twelve . «
41008020	» And when I broke the seven for the four thousand , how many large baskets full of pieces did you take up ? « And they said , » Seven . «
41008021	He said to them , » Do you not yet understand ? «
41008022	And they came to Bethsaida ; and some people brought a blind man to him , and begged him to touch him .
41008023	So he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village . And when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands on him , he asked him » Do you see anything ? «
41008024	And he looked up and said , » I see men ; but they look like trees , walking . «
41008025	Then he put his hands on his eyes again and made him look up . And he was restored , and saw everything clearly .
41008026	And he sent him away to his home , saying , » Do not even go into the village . «
41008027	And Jesus went on with his disciples , to the villages of Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way he asked his disciples , » Who do men say that I am ? «
41008028	They replied , » Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , one of the prophets . «
41008029	And he asked them , » But who do you say that I am ? « Peter answered him , » You are the Christ . «
41008030	And he charged them to tell no one about him .
41008031	And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41008032	He spoke plainly about this . And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
41008033	But when he had turned around and looked at his disciples , he rebuked Peter , and said , » Get behind me , Satan ! For you are not mindful of the things of God , but the things of men . «
41008034	And he called to him the multitude with his disciples , and said to them , » If anyone would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me .
41008035	For whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it .
41008036	For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world , and forfeit his soul ?
41008037	Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul ?
41008038	For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . «
41009001	And he said to them , » Truly , I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power . «
41009002	After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John , and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves . And he was transfigured before them ,
41009003	and his clothes became dazzling , exceedingly white , as no launderer on earth could bleach them .
41009004	And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
41009005	And Peter said to Jesus , » Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . And let us make three tabernacles — one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . «
41009006	For he did not know what to say , for they were greatly afraid .
41009007	And a cloud came and overshadowed them ; and a voice came out of the cloud , » This is my beloved Son . Listen to him ! «
41009008	Suddenly , when they looked around , they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only .
41009009	And as they were coming down the mountain , he charged them to tell no one what they had seen , until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41009010	So they kept the matter to themselves , questioning what the rising from the dead meant .
41009011	And they asked him , » Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? «
41009012	Then he said to them , » Elijah does come first and restores all things . And how is it written of the Son of Man , that he must suffer many things and be treated with contempt ?
41009013	But I tell you that Elijah has come , and they did to him whatever they wished , as it is written of him . «
41009014	And when they came to the disciples , they saw a great crowd around them , and scribes arguing with them .
41009015	Immediately , when they saw him , all the people were greatly amazed , and ran to him and greeted him .
41009016	And he asked them , » What are you discussing with them ? «
41009017	And one of the crowd answered him , » Teacher , I brought my son to you , who has a mute spirit .
41009018	And wherever it seizes him , it throws him down ; he foams at the mouth , gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid . I asked your disciples to cast out the spirit , but they could not . «
41009019	He answered him , » O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I bear with you ? Bring him to me . «
41009020	And they brought the boy to him . And when the spirit saw him , immediately it convulsed the boy , and he fell on the ground and rolled about , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	And Jesus asked his father , » How long has he been like this ? « And he said , » From childhood .
41009022	And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him . But if you can do anything , have pity on us and help us . «
41009023	Jesus said to him , » If you can , all things are possible to him who believes . «
41009024	Immediately the father of the child cried out and said , » I believe ; help my unbelief ! «
41009025	And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , » You dumb and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him , and never enter him again . «
41009026	And the spirit cried out , convulsed him terribly , and came out . And the boy was like a corpse ; so that many of them said , » He is dead . «
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up , and he arose .
41009028	And when he had come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , » Why could we not cast it out ? «
41009029	And he said to them , » This kind can only come out by prayer . «
41009030	Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee , and he did not want anyone to know it .
41009031	For he was teaching his disciples and said to them , » The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men . They will kill him , and when he is killed , after three days he will rise . «
41009032	But they did not understand the saying , and they were afraid to ask him .
41009033	And they came to Capernaum . When he was in the house , he asked them , » What were you discussing on the road ? «
41009034	But they kept silent ; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest .
41009035	And he sat down , called the twelve , and said to them , » If anyone desires to be first , he must be last of all and servant of all . «
41009036	And he took a little child , and put him in the midst of them . And taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
41009037	» Whoever receives one of these little children in my name receives me ; and whoever receives me , receives not me but him who sent me . «
41009038	John said to him , » Teacher , we saw a man casting out demons in your name and we forbade him , because he was not one of us . «
41009039	But Jesus said , » Do not forbid him , for no one who does a miracle in my name can soon afterward speak evil of me .
41009040	For he who is not against us is for us .
41009041	For truly , I say to you , whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you belong to Christ , will by no means lose his reward .
41009042	» Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea .
41009043	If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell , to the fire that shall never be quenched .
41009045	And if your foot causes you to sin , cut it off ; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell .
41009047	And if your eye causes you to sin , pluck it out . It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell ,
41009048	where ‘ their worm does not die , and the fire is not quenched . ’
41009049	For every one will be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good , but if the salt loses its flavor , how will you season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . «
41010001	Then he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan . And crowds gathered to him again ; and again , as his custom was , he taught them .
41010002	The Pharisees came and in order to test him asked , » Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? «
41010003	He answered them , » What did Moses command you ? «
41010004	They said , » Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce , and to put her away . «
41010005	But Jesus said to them , » Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
41010006	But from the beginning of creation God ‘ made them male and female . ’
41010007	‘ For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife ,
41010008	and the two shall become one flesh . ’ So they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	Therefore what God has joined together , let not man separate . «
41010010	In the house his disciples also asked him again about this matter .
41010011	So he said to them , » Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
41010012	And if she divorces her husband and marries another man , she commits adultery . «
41010013	And they were bringing children to him , that he might touch them ; but the disciples rebuked them .
41010014	But when Jesus saw it , he was indignant and said to them , » Let the little children come to me ; and do not hinder them , for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
41010015	Truly , I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it . «
41010016	And he took them in his arms , put his hands on them and blessed them .
41010017	And as he was setting out on his journey , a man ran up and knelt before him , and asked him , » Good Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? «
41010018	And Jesus said to him , » Why do you call me good ? No one is good but God alone .
41010019	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not murder , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honor your father and mother . ’ «
41010020	And he said to him , » Teacher , all these I have observed from my youth . «
41010021	Then Jesus , looking at him , loved him , and said to him , » You lack one thing ; go and sell what you have , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . «
41010022	But he fell sad at this word , and went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions .
41010023	Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , » How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God ! «
41010024	And the disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus said to them again , » Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . «
41010026	And they were exceedingly astonished , and said to him , » Then who can be saved ? «
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , » With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God . «
41010028	Peter began to say to him , » See , we have left everything and followed you . «
41010029	Jesus said , » Truly , I say to you , there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands , for my sake and for the gospel ,
41010030	who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time — house and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions , and in the age to come , eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first will be last , and the last first . «
41010032	They were on the road , going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking ahead of them ; and they were amazed , and those who followed were afraid . And he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him .
41010033	» Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death , and deliver him to the Gentiles ;
41010034	and they will mock him , and spit on him , and scourge him , and kill him . And after three days he will rise . «
41010035	Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to him and said , » Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask . «
41010036	And he said to them , » What do you want me to do for you ? «
41010037	And they said to him , » Grant us to sit , one at your right hand and the other at your left , in your glory . «
41010038	But Jesus said to them , » You do not know what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I drink , or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with ? «
41010039	They said to him , » We are able . « So Jesus said to them , » You will indeed drink the cup that I drink , and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized ;
41010040	but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared . «
41010041	And when the ten heard it , they began to be indignant with James and John .
41010042	But Jesus called them to himself and said to them , » You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
41010043	But it shall not be so among you . But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ,
41010044	and whoever wants to be first among you must be slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . «
41010046	And they came to Jericho . And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude , Bartimaeus , a blind man , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the roadside begging .
41010047	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out and say , » Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! «
41010048	Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet , but he cried out all the more , » Son of David , have mercy on me ! «
41010049	So Jesus stopped and said , » Call him . « And they called the blind man , saying to him , » Take heart ; rise , he is calling you . «
41010050	And throwing aside his garment , he rose and came to Jesus .
41010051	And Jesus said to him , » What do you want me to do for you ? « And the blind man said to him , » Master , let me receive my sight . «
41010052	Then Jesus said to him , » Go your way ; your faith has made you well . « And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road .
41011001	And when they drew near Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
41011002	and said to them , » Go into the village opposite you , and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied , on which no one has ever sat . Untie it and bring it .
41011003	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately . ’ «
41011004	They went away and found a colt tied at the door outside in the open street , and they untied it .
41011005	And some of those who stood there said to them , » What are you doing , untying the colt ? «
41011006	They answered as Jesus had told them to , and they let them go .
41011007	Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments on it , and he sat on it .
41011008	And many spread their garments on the road , and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields .
41011009	And those who went before and those who followed cried out , » Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	
41011011	Jesus entered Jerusalem , and went into the temple . And when he had looked round at everything , as it was already late , he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
41011012	On the next day , when they came from Bethany , he was hungry .
41011013	And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf , he went to see if he could find anything on it . When he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
41011014	And he said to it , » May no one ever eat fruit from you again . « And his disciples heard it .
41011015	So they came to Jerusalem . And Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple , and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves .
41011016	And he would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple .
41011017	And as he taught them , he said , » Is it not written , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ’ ? But you have made it a den of robbers . «
41011018	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him ; for they feared him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
41011019	When evening came , they went out of the city .
41011020	In the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree withered from the roots .
41011021	Peter remembered and said to him , » Rabbi , look ! The fig tree which you cursed has withered . «
41011022	And Jesus answered them , » Have faith in God .
41011023	Truly , I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and cast into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says will come to pass , it will be done for him .
41011024	Therefore I tell you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
41011025	And whenever you stand praying , if you have anything against anyone , forgive him , so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses .
41011027	Then they came again to Jerusalem . And as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders came to him .
41011028	And they said to him , » By what authority are you doing these things ? Who gave you this authority to do them ? «
41011029	Jesus said to them , » I will ask you one question ; answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41011030	The baptism of John — was it from heaven or from men ? Answer me . «
41011031	And they reasoned among themselves , » If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
41011032	But if we say , ‘ From men ’ « — they feared the people , for all held that John was a real prophet .
41011033	So they answered Jesus , » We do not know . « And Jesus said to them , » Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . «
41012001	Then he began to speak to them in parables : » A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it , dug a place for the wine vat and built a tower . And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country .
41012002	At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants , to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
41012003	And they took him and beat him , and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	Again he sent to them another servant , and they wounded him in the head , and treated him shamefully .
41012005	And he sent another , and him they killed ; and so with many others , some they beat and some they killed .
41012006	He still had one left to send , a beloved son . He sent him to them last , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
41012007	But those tenants said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . ’
41012008	So they took him and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
41012009	What will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the tenants , and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Have you not read this Scripture : ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone ;
41012011	
41012012	And they sought to arrest him , but feared the multitude , for they knew he had spoken the parable against them . So they left him and went away .
41012013	Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians , to catch him in his words .
41012014	When they came , they said to him , » Teacher , we know that you are true , and care about no man ; for you do not regard the person of men , but teach the way of God in truth . Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ?
41012015	Should we pay them , or should we not ? « But knowing their hypocrisy , he said to them , » Why do you put me to the test ? Bring me a denarius , and let me look at it . «
41012016	And they brought one . And he said to them , » Whose likeness and inscription is this ? « They said to him , » Caesar's . «
41012017	Jesus said to them , » Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . « And they were amazed at him .
41012018	Then some Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him ; and they asked him a question , saying :
41012019	» Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife , but leaves no child , the man must take the wife , and raise up children for his brother .
41012020	Now there were seven brothers ; the first took a wife , and when he died left no children .
41012021	And the second took her , and he died ; leaving behind no children . And the third likewise .
41012022	So the seven had her and left no children . Last of all the woman died also .
41012023	In the resurrection , whose wife will she be ? For the seven had her as wife . «
41012024	Jesus said to them , » Is not this why you are wrong , that you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God ?
41012025	For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
41012026	And as for the dead being raised , have you not read in the book of Moses , in the passage about the bush , how God said to him , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
41012027	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living ; you are greatly mistaken . «
41012028	And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another , and seeing that he had answered them well , asked him , » Which commandment is the first of all ? «
41012029	Jesus answered , » The first is : ‘ Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord .
41012030	And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ’
41012031	The second is this : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’ There is no other commandment greater than these . «
41012032	And the scribe said to him , » You are right , Teacher ; you have well said that God is one , and there is no other but he ;
41012033	and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the strength , and to love one's neighbor as oneself , is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . «
41012034	And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , » You are not far from the kingdom of God . « And after that no one dared to ask him any question .
41012035	And Jesus said , while he taught in the temple , » How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
41012036	David himself , speaking by the Holy Spirit , declared : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : » Sit at my right hand till I put your enemies under your feet . « ’
41012037	Therefore David himself calls him ‘ Lord ’ ; how is he then his son ? « And the common people heard him gladly .
41012038	And in his teaching he said , » Beware of the scribes , who like to go around in long robes , and to have salutations in the market places
41012039	and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts ,
41012040	who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers . They will receive the greater condemnation . «
41012041	And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury , and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury . Many people who were rich put in large sums .
41012042	And a poor widow came , and put in two copper coins , which make a penny .
41012043	And he called his disciples to him , and said to them , » Truly , I say to you , this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury .
41012044	For they all put in out of their abundance , but she out of her poverty put in everything — all she had to live on . «
41013001	And as he came out of the temple , one of his disciples said to him , » Look , Teacher , what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings ! «
41013002	And Jesus said to him , » Do you see all these great buildings ? There will not be left here one stone upon another , that will not be thrown down . «
41013003	Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter , James , John , and Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	» Tell us , when will this be ? And what will be the sign when these things are all to be fulfilled ? «
41013005	And Jesus began to say to them : » Take heed that no one deceives you .
41013006	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and will deceive many .
41013007	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed ; such things must happen , but the end is not yet .
41013008	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . And there will be earthquakes in various places , and there will be famines and troubles . These are the beginning of birth pains .
41013009	But watch out for yourselves , for they will deliver you up to councils , and you will be beaten in the synagogues . You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them .
41013010	And the gospel must first be preached to all nations .
41013011	And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up , do not worry beforehand what you are to say . But say whatever is given you in that hour ; for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child ; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death .
41013013	And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake . But he who endures to the end will be saved .
41013014	» When you see ‘ the abomination of desolation ’ standing where it ought not to be ( let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
41013015	Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house , nor enter to take anything out of his house .
41013016	And let him who is in the field not go back to get his cloak .
41013017	But woe for those who are pregnant and those who are nursing babies in those days !
41013018	Pray that it may not happen in winter .
41013019	For in those days there will be tribulation , such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will be .
41013020	And if the Lord had not shortened those days , no flesh would be saved ; but for the sake of the elect , whom he chose , he shortened the days .
41013021	Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or , ‘ Look , he is there ! ’ do not believe it .
41013022	For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
41013023	But take heed ; see , I have told you all things beforehand .
41013024	» But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ;
41013025	
41013026	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	And then he will send out his angels , and gather his elect from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven .
41013028	» Now learn this lesson from the fig tree : as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves , you know that summer is near .
41013029	So also , when you see these things happening , you know that it is near , right at the door .
41013030	Truly , I say to you , this generation will not pass away before all these things take place .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
41013032	» But of that day or that hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
41013033	Take heed , watch ; for you do not know when the time will come .
41013034	It is like a man going on a journey , when he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge , each with his work , and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch .
41013035	Watch therefore — for you do not know when the master of the house will come , in the evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or in the morning —
41013036	lest , coming suddenly , he find you sleeping .
41013037	And what I say to you , I say to all : Watch ! «
41014001	It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread . And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth , and kill him .
41014002	But they said , » Not during the feast , lest there be an uproar of the people . «
41014003	And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at table , a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard , very costly . And she broke the flask and poured it over his head .
41014004	But there were some who said to themselves indignantly , » Why was this ointment wasted ?
41014005	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor . « And they criticized her sharply .
41014006	But Jesus said , » Let her alone . Why do you trouble her ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
41014007	For you always have the poor with you , and whenever you will , you can do good to them ; but you will not always have me .
41014008	She has done what she could . She has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial .
41014009	And truly , I say to you , wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world , what she has done will also be told in memory of her . «
41014010	Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went to the chief priests to betray him to them .
41014011	And when they heard it they were glad , and promised to give him money . So he sought an opportunity to betray him .
41014012	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread , when they killed the Passover lamb , his disciples said to him , » Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover ? «
41014013	And he sent two of his disciples , and said to them , » Go into the city , and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you ; follow him .
41014014	And wherever he enters , say to the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says , where is my guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’
41014015	He will show you a large upper room , furnished and ready ; make preparations for us there . «
41014016	So the disciples set out and went to the city , and found it just as he had told them ; and they prepared the Passover .
41014017	And when it was evening he came with the twelve .
41014018	And as they were at table eating , Jesus said , » Truly , I say to you , one of you will betray me , one who is eating with me . «
41014019	They began to be sorrowful , and to say to him one by one , » Is it I ? «
41014020	He said to them , » It is one of the twelve , one who dips bread into the dish with me .
41014021	For the Son of Man goes just as it is written of him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born . «
41014022	And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , blessed and broke it , and gave it to them and said , » Take ; this is my body . «
41014023	Then he took the cup , and when he had given thanks he gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
41014024	And he said to them , » This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many .
41014025	Truly , I say to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God . «
41014026	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	And Jesus said to them , » You will all fall away ; for it is written : ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ’
41014028	But after I have been raised , I will go before you to Galilee . «
41014029	Peter said to him , » Even if all fall away , I will not . «
41014030	Jesus said to him , » Truly , I say to you that this very night , before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . «
41014031	But he spoke more vehemently , » If I have to die with you , I will not deny you ! « And they all said the same .
41014032	They went to a place which was called Gethsemane ; and he said to his disciples , » Sit here , while I pray . «
41014033	And he took Peter , James and John with him , and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled .
41014034	And he said to them , » My soul is very sorrowful , even to death ; stay here , and watch . «
41014035	And going a little farther , he fell on the ground and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
41014036	And he said , » Abba , Father , all things are possible for you . Take this cup away from me ; yet not what I will , but what you will . «
41014037	Then he came and found them sleeping , and he said to Peter , » Simon , are you asleep ? Could you not watch one hour ?
41014038	Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . «
41014039	And again he went away and prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	And when he came again , he found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy ; and they did not know what to answer him .
41014041	Then he came the third time and said to them , » Are you still sleeping and resting ? It is enough ! The hour has come ; behold , the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Rise , let us go ; see , my betrayer is at hand . «
41014043	And immediately , while he was still speaking , Judas came , one of the twelve , and with him a crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
41014044	Now the betrayer had given them a signal , saying , » The one I shall kiss is the man ; seize him and lead him away under guard . «
41014045	And when he came , he went up to him at once , and said , » Rabbi ! « and he kissed him .
41014046	And they laid hands on him and seized him .
41014047	And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
41014048	And Jesus said to them , » Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs to capture me ?
41014049	Every day I was with you in the temple teaching , and you did not seize me . But the scriptures must be fulfilled . «
41014050	Then they all forsook him and fled .
41014051	And a young man followed him , with nothing but a linen cloth around his body . And they seized him ,
41014052	and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked .
41014053	And they led Jesus to the high priest ; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled .
41014054	But Peter followed him at a distance , right into the courtyard of the high priest . And he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire .
41014055	Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death , but they found none .
41014056	For many bore false witness against him , but their testimonies did not agree .
41014057	Then some stood up and bore false witness against him , saying ,
41014058	» We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another not made with hands . ’ «
41014059	Yet even then their testimony did not agree .
41014060	And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , » Have you no answer to make ? What is it that these men testify against you ? «
41014061	But he was silent and made no answer . Again the high priest asked him , » Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? «
41014062	And Jesus said , » I am . And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power , and coming with the clouds of heaven . «
41014063	The high priest tore his clothes and said , » Why do we need any more witnesses ?
41014064	You have heard the blasphemy . What do you think ? « And they all condemned him as worthy of death .
41014065	Then some began to spit on him , and to blindfold him , and to beat him , and to say to him , » Prophesy ! « And the guards received him with slaps in the face .
41014066	Now as Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the servant girls of the high priest came .
41014067	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked at him , and said , » You also were with the Nazarene , Jesus . «
41014068	But he denied it , saying , » I neither know nor understand what you mean . « And he went out into the gateway .
41014069	And the servant girl saw him again , and began to say to those who stood by , » This is one of them . «
41014070	But again he denied it . And after a little while again those standing near said to Peter , » Surely you are one of them ; for you are a Gallilean . «
41014071	But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear , » I do not know this man of whom you speak . «
41014072	And immediately the rooster crowed a second time . Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him , » Before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . « And he broke down and wept .
41015001	Very early in the morning , the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council ; and they bound Jesus , led him away , and delivered him to Pilate .
41015002	Then Pilate asked him , » Are you the King of the Jews ? « And he answered him , » It is as you say . «
41015003	And the chief priests accused him of many things .
41015004	And Pilate again asked him , » Have you no answer to make ? See how many things they bring against you . «
41015005	But Jesus still made no answer , so that Pilate was amazed .
41015006	Now at the feast he was accustomed to release for them one prisoner whom they requested .
41015007	And with the rebels in prison , who had committed murder in the insurrection , there was a man called Barabbas .
41015008	And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he had always done for them .
41015009	But Pilate answered them , » Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? «
41015010	For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead .
41015012	And Pilate again said to them , » Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews ? «
41015013	And they cried out again , » Crucify him ! «
41015014	And Pilate said to them , » Why , what evil has he done ? « But they shouted all the more , » Crucify him ! «
41015015	So Pilate , wanting to satisfy the crowd , released Barabbas to them ; and he delivered Jesus , after he had scourged him , to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers led him away into the palace ( that is , the Praetorium ) and they called together the whole battalion .
41015017	And they clothed him in a purple cloak , and they twisted a crown of thorns and put it on him .
41015018	And they began to salute him , » Hail , King of the Jews ! «
41015019	Then they struck him on the head with a reed and spat on him ; and falling on their knees , they paid homage to him .
41015020	And when they had mocked him , they took the purple robe off him , and put his own clothes on him . Then they led him out to crucify him .
41015021	Then they compelled a certain man , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , as he was coming out of the country and passing by , to carry his cross .
41015022	And they brought him to the place called Golgotha ( which means the place of a skull ) .
41015023	Then they offered him wine mingled with myrrh , but he did not take it .
41015024	And when they crucified him , they divided his garments , casting lots for them to determine what each man should take .
41015025	And it was the third hour , when they crucified him .
41015026	And the inscription of the charge written against him read : THE KING OF THE JEWS .
41015027	And with him they crucified two robbers , one on his right and one on his left .
41015029	And those who passed by hurled insults at him , wagging their heads , and saying , » Aha ! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days ,
41015030	save yourself , and come down from the cross ! «
41015031	So also the chief priests mocked him among themselves with the scribes , and said , » He saved others ; he cannot save himself .
41015032	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , come down now from the cross , that we may see and believe . « Those who were crucified with him also reviled him .
41015033	And when the sixth hour had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
41015034	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , » Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? « — which means , » My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? «
41015035	When some of those standing near heard this , they said , » Behold , he is calling Elijah . «
41015036	And one ran and filled a sponge full of wine vinegar , put it on a reed , and offered it to him to drink , saying , » Wait , let us see if Elijah will come to take him down . «
41015037	And with a loud cry , Jesus breathed his last .
41015038	Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	So when the centurion , who stood opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last , he said , » Truly this man was the Son of God ! «
41015040	There were also women looking on from afar , among whom were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses , and Salome ,
41015041	who also followed him and ministered to him when he was in Galilee ; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	Now when evening had come , because it was the Preparation Day , that is , the day before the Sabbath ,
41015043	Joseph of Arimathea , a prominent council member , who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God , coming and taking courage , went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
41015044	Pilate marveled that he was already dead ; and summoning the centurion , he asked him if he was already dead .
41015045	And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead , he granted the body to Joseph .
41015046	Then he bought fine linen , took him down , and wrapped him in the linen . And he laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock , and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid .
41016001	Now when the Sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought spices , so that they might go and anoint him .
41016002	And very early on the first day of the week , they came to the tomb when the sun had risen .
41016003	And they asked each other , » Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us ? «
41016004	But when they looked up , they saw that the stone , though it was very large , had been rolled away .
41016005	And entering the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , dressed in a white robe ; and they were alarmed .
41016006	But he said to them , » Do not be alarmed . You seek Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He has risen ! He is not here . See the place where they laid him .
41016007	But go , tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee ; there you will see him , as he told you . «
41016008	So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had gripped them . And they said nothing to anyone , for they were afraid .
41016009	Now when he rose early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven demons .
41016010	She went and told those who had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
41016011	And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her , they did not believe it .
41016012	After this he appeared in another form to two of them , as they were walking into the country .
41016013	And they went and told it to the rest , but they did not believe them either .
41016014	Later he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table ; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
41016015	And he said to them , » Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation .
41016016	He who believes and is baptized will be saved ; but he who does not believe will be condemned .
41016017	And these signs will accompany those who believe : in my name they will cast out demons ; they will speak in new tongues ;
41016018	they will pick up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it will not hurt them ; they will lay their hands on the sick , and they will recover . «
41016019	So then the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	Then they went out and preached everywhere , and the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that accompanied it . Amen .
42001001	Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been fulfilled among us ,
42001002	just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word ,
42001003	it seemed good to me also , having carefully investigated all things from the very first , to write to you an orderly account , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	so that you may know the certainty of the things which you have been taught .
42001005	In the days of Herod , king of Judea , there was a priest named Zechariah , of the division of Abijah ; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
42001006	And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
42001007	But they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they were both well advanced in years .
42001008	Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty ,
42001009	according to the custom of the priesthood , it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
42001010	And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense .
42001011	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him , and fear fell upon him .
42001013	But the angel said to him , » Do not be afraid , Zechariah , for your prayer is heard ; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
42001014	And you will have joy and gladness , and many will rejoice at his birth .
42001015	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink . He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother’s womb .
42001016	And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God .
42001017	And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah , ‘ to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , ’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just , to make ready a people prepared for the Lord . «
42001018	And Zechariah said to the angel , » How shall I know this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is well advanced in years . «
42001019	And the angel answered him , » I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God ; and I was sent to speak to you , and to bring you this good news .
42001020	And behold , you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things come to pass , because you did not believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their time . «
42001021	And the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple .
42001022	But when he came out , he could not speak to them ; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple , for he made signs to them and remained speechless .
42001023	And when his time of service was completed , he went to his home .
42001024	After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived , and for five months she hid herself , saying ,
42001025	» Thus the Lord has done to me , in the days when he looked on me , to take away my reproach among people . «
42001026	In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth ,
42001027	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . The virgin’s name was Mary .
42001028	The angel went to her and said , » Hail , O highly favored one , the Lord is with you ! «
42001029	But she was greatly troubled at his saying , and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be .
42001030	And the angel said to her , » Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God .
42001031	And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you shall call his name Jesus .
42001032	He will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High ; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David .
42001033	And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there will be no end . «
42001034	And Mary said to the angel , » How can this be , since I am a virgin ? «
42001035	And the angel answered her , » The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you ; therefore the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God .
42001036	And behold , your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
42001037	For with God nothing will be impossible . «
42001038	Then Mary said , » Behold , I am the servant of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word . « And the angel departed from her .
42001039	In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country , to a city of Judah ,
42001040	and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	And she exclaimed with a loud voice , » Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
42001043	But why is this granted me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
42001044	For behold , as soon as the voice of your greeting came to my ears , the babe in my womb leaped for joy .
42001045	And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord . «
42001046	And Mary said :
42001047	
42001048	
42001049	
42001050	
42001051	
42001052	
42001053	
42001054	
42001055	
42001056	And Mary remained with her about three months , and returned to her home .
42001057	Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered , and she gave birth to a son .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her , and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father ,
42001060	but his mother said , » No ; he shall be called John . «
42001061	They said to her , » There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name . «
42001062	And they made signs to his father , inquiring what he would have him called .
42001063	And he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , » His name is John . « And they all marveled .
42001064	And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he spoke , praising God .
42001065	And fear came on all their neighbors . And all these things were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea ;
42001066	and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , » What then will this child be ? « For the hand of the Lord was with him .
42001067	Now his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying :
42001068	
42001069	
42001070	
42001071	
42001072	
42001073	
42001074	
42001075	
42001076	
42001077	
42001078	
42001079	
42001080	And the child grew and became strong in spirit , and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel .
42002001	In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the world .
42002002	This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	And all went to be registered , everyone to his own city .
42002004	And Joseph also went up from Galilee , from the city of Nazareth , to Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and lineage of David ,
42002005	to be registered with Mary , his betrothed wife , who was with child .
42002006	And while they were there , the time came for her to be delivered .
42002007	And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths , and laid him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn .
42002008	And in that region there were shepherds living out in the fields , keeping watch over their flock by night .
42002009	And an angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were filled with fear .
42002010	Then the angel said to them , » Do not be afraid , for behold , I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people .
42002011	For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior , who is Christ the Lord .
42002012	And this will be a sign to you : you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger . «
42002013	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying ,
42002014	
42002015	When the angels had gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said to one another , » Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . «
42002016	And they went with haste , and found Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
42002017	Now when they had seen him , they made widely known the saying which had been told them concerning this child .
42002018	And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them .
42002019	But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart .
42002020	Then the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it had been told them .
42002021	And at the end of eight days , when he was circumcised , he was called Jesus , the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
42002022	And when the time of their purification according to the law of Moses was completed , they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
42002023	( as it is written in the law of the Lord , » Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord « ) ,
42002024	and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord , » a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons . «
42002025	Now there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon , and this man was righteous and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
42002026	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ .
42002027	So he came by the Spirit into the temple . And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus , to do for him according to the custom of the law ,
42002028	he took him up in his arms and blessed God , and said :
42002029	
42002030	
42002031	
42002032	
42002033	And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him .
42002034	Then Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary his mother , » Behold , this child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel , and for a sign that will be spoken against
42002035	( and a sword will pierce through your own soul also ) , so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed . «
42002036	And there was a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was of a great age , and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity ,
42002037	and as a widow till she was eighty-four . She did not depart from the temple , but worshipped with fasting and prayer night and day .
42002038	And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God , and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem .
42002039	And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee , to their own city , Nazareth .
42002040	And the child grew and became strong ; he was filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him .
42002041	His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover .
42002042	And when he was twelve years old , they went up to the Feast , according to the custom .
42002043	And when the feast was over , as they were returning , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents did not know it ,
42002044	but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day's journey , and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances .
42002045	And when they did not find him , they returned to Jerusalem , seeking him .
42002046	After three days they found him in the temple , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
42002048	And when they saw him they were astonished ; and his mother said to him , » Son , why have you treated us so ? Behold , your father and I have been looking for you anxiously . «
42002049	And he said to them , » Why did you seek me ? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house ? «
42002050	But they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them .
42002051	Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth , and was obedient to them , but his mother kept all these things in her heart .
42002052	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men .
42003001	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene ,
42003002	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness .
42003003	And he went into all the region around the Jordan , preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
42003004	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , » The voice of one crying in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
42003005	
42003006	
42003007	Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him , » You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
42003008	Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance , and do not begin to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones .
42003009	And even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees ; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . «
42003010	And the multitudes asked him , » What then shall we do ? «
42003011	And he answered them , » He who has two tunics , let him share with him who has none ; and he who has food , let him do likewise . «
42003012	Tax collectors also came to be baptized , and said to him , » Teacher , what shall we do ? «
42003013	And he said to them , » Collect no more than is appointed you . «
42003014	Likewise the soldiers asked him , » And what shall we do ? « So he said to them , » Rob no one by violence or accuse falsely , and be content with your wages . «
42003015	As the people were in expectation , and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John , whether perhaps he were the Christ ,
42003016	John answered them all , » I baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I is coming , the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
42003017	His winnowing fork is in his hand , to clear his threshing floor , and to gather the wheat into his barn , but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire . «
42003018	And with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people .
42003019	But Herod the tetrarch , being rebuked by him concerning Herodias , his brother's wife , and for all the other evil things Herod had done ,
42003020	added this to them all , that he shut up John in prison .
42003021	When all the people were being baptized , Jesus was also baptized . And as he was praying , the heaven was opened
42003022	and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , » You are my beloved Son ; with you I am well pleased . «
42003023	Now Jesus himself , when he began his ministry , was about thirty years of age , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	the son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	the son of Joshua , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	the son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	the son of Amminadab , the son of Ram , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	the son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	the son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalalel , the son of Cainan ,
42003038	the son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
42004002	being tempted for forty days by the devil . In those days he ate nothing , and when they had ended , he was hungry .
42004003	And the devil said to him , » If you are the Son of God , command this stone to become bread . «
42004004	But Jesus answered him , » It is written , ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone . ’ «
42004005	Then the devil took him up to a high place , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
42004006	And he said to him , » To you I will give all this authority and their glory ; for it has been delivered to me , and I give it to whom I will .
42004007	If you , then , will worship me , it shall all be yours . «
42004008	And Jesus answered him , » It is written , ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God , and him only shall you serve . ’ «
42004009	He took him to Jerusalem , set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , » If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down from here ;
42004010	for it is written : ‘ He will give his angels charge of you , to guard you , ’
42004011	and , ‘ In their hands they will bear you up , lest you strike your foot against a stone . ’ «
42004012	And Jesus answered him , » It is said , ‘ You shall not tempt the Lord your God . ’ «
42004013	When the devil had ended every temptation , he departed from him until an opportune time .
42004014	Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and news of him went out through all the surrounding country .
42004015	And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified by all .
42004016	And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up . And as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
42004017	And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . And he opened the book , and found the place where it was written :
42004018	
42004019	
42004020	Then he closed the book , and gave it back to the attendant , and sat down ; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him .
42004021	And he began to say to them , » Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing . «
42004022	And all spoke well of him , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth ; and they said , » Is not this Joseph's son ? «
42004023	He said to them , » Surely you will quote this proverb to me : ‘ Physician , heal yourself ! Do here also in your own country what we have heard that you did in Capernaum . ’ «
42004024	Then he said , » Truly , I say to you , no prophet is accepted in his own country .
42004025	But I tell you truly , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , and there was a great famine throughout all the land ;
42004026	but Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath , in the region of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
42004027	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha ; and not one of them was cleansed , but only Naaman the Syrian . «
42004028	When they heard this , all in the synagogue were filled with wrath .
42004029	And they rose up and cast him out of the city , and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built , that they might throw him down the cliff .
42004030	But passing through the midst of them , he went his way .
42004031	Then he went down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and he was teaching them on the Sabbath .
42004032	And they were astonished at his teaching , for his word was with authority .
42004033	And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon . And he cried out with a loud voice ,
42004034	» Ha ! What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God ! «
42004035	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , » Be quiet , and come out of him ! « And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst , he came out of him without doing him any harm .
42004036	And they were all amazed and said to one another , » What is this word ? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ! «
42004037	And the report about him went out into every place in the surrounding region .
42004038	And he arose and left the synagogue , and entered Simon's house . Now Simon’s mother-in-law was ill with a high fever , and they made request of him on her behalf .
42004039	So he stood over her and rebuked the fever , and it left her . And immediately she rose and served them .
42004040	When the sun was setting , all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them .
42004041	And demons also came out of many , crying , » You are the Son of God ! « But he rebuked them , and would not allow them to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
42004042	Now when it was day , he departed and went into a deserted place . And the people sought him and came to him , and tried to keep him from leaving them ;
42004043	but he said to them , » I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also , because I was sent for this purpose . «
42004044	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea .
42005001	Now as the people pressed around him to hear the word of God , he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret .
42005002	And he saw two boats by the lake ; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets .
42005003	Then he got into one of the boats , which was Simon's , and asked him to put out a little from the land . And he sat down and taught the people from the boat .
42005004	When he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , » Put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a catch . «
42005005	And Simon answered , » Master , we toiled all night and caught nothing ! But at your word I will let down the nets . «
42005006	And when they had done this , they caught a great number of fish , and their nets were breaking .
42005007	So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . And they came and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus' knees , saying , » Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord ! «
42005009	For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken ;
42005010	and so also were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , » Do not be afraid . From now on you will catch men . «
42005011	So when they had brought their boats to land , they left everything and followed him .
42005012	While he was in one of the cities , a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus ; and he fell on his face and begged him , » Lord , if you are willing , you can make me clean . «
42005013	And he stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , » I am willing ; be clean . « And immediately the leprosy left him .
42005014	And he charged him to tell no one , » But go and show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your cleansing as a testimony to them , just as Moses commanded . «
42005015	But the report went around concerning him all the more ; and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
42005016	But he often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed .
42005017	One day as he was teaching , there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by , who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem . And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal .
42005018	Then behold , men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed , and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus .
42005019	When they could not find a way to bring him in , because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus .
42005020	When he saw their faith he said , » Man , your sins are forgiven you . «
42005021	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , » Who is this who speaks blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? «
42005022	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answered them , » Why are you reasoning in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise up and walk ’ ?
42005024	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins « — he said to the man who was paralyzed — » I say to you , rise , take up your bed and go home . «
42005025	Immediately he rose up before them , took up what he had been lying on , and went home , glorifying God .
42005026	And they were all amazed , and they glorified God and were filled with awe , saying , » We have seen strange things today . «
42005027	After this he went out , and saw a tax collector , named Levi , sitting at the tax office ; and he said to him , » Follow me . «
42005028	And he left everything , rose up and followed him .
42005029	Then Levi made him a great feast in his house ; and there were a great number of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them .
42005030	And the Pharisees and their scribes complained against his disciples , saying , » Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? «
42005031	And Jesus answered them , » Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick .
42005032	I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . «
42005033	They said to him , » The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers , and so do the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours eat and drink . «
42005034	And Jesus said to them , » Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them ?
42005035	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them ; then they will fast in those days . «
42005036	He told them a parable also : » No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one ; if he does , he will tear the new garment , and the piece from the new will not match the old .
42005037	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; if he does , the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled , and the skins will be ruined .
42005038	But new wine must be put into new wineskins .
42005039	And no one after drinking old wine desires the new ; for he says , ‘ The old is better . ’ «
42006001	One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grain fields , and his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain , rubbing them in their hands .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees said , » Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ? «
42006003	Jesus answered them , » Have you not read what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him :
42006004	how he entered the house of God , took and ate the consecrated bread , and also gave some to those with him , which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat ? «
42006005	And he said to them , » The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . «
42006006	On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught , and a man was there whose right hand was withered .
42006007	The scribes and the Pharisees watched him closely , to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath , so that they might find an accusation against him .
42006008	But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , » Rise and stand here . « And he rose and stood there .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them , » I ask you , which is lawful on the Sabbath : to do good or to do evil , to save life or to destroy it ? «
42006010	And he looked around at them all , and said to the man , » Stretch out your hand . « He did so , and his hand was restored .
42006011	But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus .
42006012	In those days he went out to the mountain to pray , and all night he continued in prayer to God .
42006013	And when it was day , he called his disciples to himself ; and from them he chose twelve , whom he also named apostles :
42006014	Simon , whom he named Peter , and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip , and Bartholomew ,
42006015	Matthew , and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealot ,
42006016	Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
42006017	And he came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem , and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him and be healed of their diseases ,
42006018	and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured .
42006019	And all the crowd sought to touch him , for power came from him and healed them all .
42006020	He lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said : » Blessed are you poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
42006021	
42006022	Blessed are you when men hate you , and when they exclude you and revile you , and cast out your name as evil , because of the Son of Man .
42006023	Rejoice in that day and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven ; for so their fathers did to the prophets .
42006024	
42006025	
42006026	Woe to you when all men speak well of you , for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
42006027	» But I say to you who hear : love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you .
42006029	To him who strikes you on the one cheek , offer the other also . And from him who takes away your cloak , do not withhold your tunic .
42006030	Give to everyone who asks of you , and from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back .
42006031	And as you wish that men would do to you , do so to them .
42006032	If you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners do the same .
42006034	And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners lend to sinners , to receive as much back .
42006035	But love your enemies , do good , and lend , expecting nothing in return ; and your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High . For he is kind to the ungrateful and evil .
42006036	Be merciful , just as your Father is merciful .
42006037	» Judge not , and you will not be judged . Condemn not , and you will not be condemned . Forgive , and you will be forgiven .
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you ; good measure , pressed down , shaken together and running over , will be put into your lap . For with the measure you use , it will be measured back to you . «
42006039	He also told them a parable : » Can a blind man lead a blind man ? Will they not both fall into a pit ?
42006040	A disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher .
42006041	And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye , but do not notice the plank in your own eye ?
42006042	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me remove the speck that is in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite ! First take the plank from out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye .
42006043	» For no good tree bears bad fruit , nor does a bad tree bear good fruit .
42006044	For each tree is known by its own fruit . For men do not gather figs from thorns , nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush .
42006045	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good , and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil . For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks .
42006046	» Why do you call me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and do not do what I say ?
42006047	Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them , I will show you what he is like :
42006048	he is like a man building a house , who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock . And when a flood arose , the stream broke against that house and could not shake it , because it was well built .
42006049	But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation ; against which the stream broke , and immediately it fell . And the ruin of that house was great . «
42007001	When he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people , he entered Capernaum .
42007002	A centurion's servant , who was dear to him , was sick and ready to die .
42007003	When he heard of Jesus , he sent to him elders of the Jews , asking him to come and heal his servant .
42007004	And when they came to Jesus , they begged him earnestly , saying , » He is worthy to have you do this for him ,
42007005	for he loves our nation , and has built us our synagogue . «
42007006	And Jesus went with them . When he was not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying to him , » Lord , do not trouble yourself , for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof .
42007007	Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you . But say the word , and my servant will be healed .
42007008	For I am a man set under authority , with soldiers under me . And I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . «
42007009	When Jesus heard this , he marveled at him , and turned and said to the crowd that followed him , » I tell you , I have not found such great faith even in Israel . «
42007010	And when those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the servant well .
42007011	Soon afterward , he went to a city called Nain , and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him .
42007012	As he came near the gate of the city , behold , a dead man was being carried out , the only son of his mother ; and she was a widow . And a large crowd from the city was with her .
42007013	When the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her and said to her , » Do not weep . «
42007014	Then he came and touched the open coffin , and those who carried him stood still . And he said , » Young man , I say to you , arise . «
42007015	The dead man sat up , and began to speak . And he gave him to his mother .
42007016	Fear seized them all ; and they glorified God , saying , » A great prophet has arisen among us ; « and » God has visited his people . «
42007017	And this report about him spread throughout all Judea and all the surrounding country .
42007018	Then the disciples of John told him about all these things .
42007019	And John , calling to him two of his disciples , sent them to the Lord , saying , » Are you the One who is to come , or shall we look for another ? «
42007020	When the men had come to him , they said , » John the Baptist has sent us to you , saying , ‘ Are you the One who is to come , or shall we look for another ? ’ «
42007021	At that very hour he cured many of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits , and to many that were blind he gave sight .
42007022	He answered them , » Go and tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the poor have the good news preached to them .
42007023	And blessed is he who is not offended because of me . «
42007024	When the messengers of John had departed , he began to speak to the crowds concerning John : » What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	What then did you go out to see ? A man clothed in soft clothing ? Behold , those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts .
42007026	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	This is he of whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . ’
42007028	I tell you , among those born of women there is no one greater than John ; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . «
42007029	( And when they heard him , all the people , even the tax collectors , justified God , having been baptized with the baptism of John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves , not having been baptized by him . )
42007031	» To what then shall I compare the men of this generation , and what are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another : ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not weep . ’
42007033	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
42007034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Behold , a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
42007035	But wisdom is justified by all her children . «
42007036	One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him , and he went to the Pharisee's house , and reclined at the table .
42007037	And behold , a woman of the city , who was a sinner , when she learned that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house , brought an alabaster flask of perfume ,
42007038	and as she stood behind him at his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and wiped them with the hair of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the perfume .
42007039	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , » If this man were a prophet , he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him , for she is a sinner . «
42007040	And Jesus answered him , » Simon , I have something to say to you . « And he said , » Teacher , say it . «
42007041	» A certain creditor had two debtors . One owed five hundred denarii , and the other fifty .
42007042	When they had nothing with which to pay him back , he freely forgave them both . Now which of them will love him more ? «
42007043	Simon answered , » I suppose the one to whom he forgave more . « And he said to him , » You have judged rightly . «
42007044	Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon , » Do you see this woman ? I entered your house ; you gave me no water for my feet , but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head .
42007045	You gave me no kiss , but this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet from the time I came in .
42007046	You did not anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with perfume .
42007047	Therefore I tell you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much . But he who is forgiven little , loves little . «
42007048	And he said to her , » Your sins are forgiven . «
42007049	Then those who reclined at the table with him began to say among themselves , » Who is this who even forgives sins ? «
42007050	He said to the woman , » Your faith has saved you ; go in peace . «
42008001	Soon afterward , he went on through every city and village , preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God . And the twelve were with him ,
42008002	and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had come out ,
42008003	and Joanna the wife of Chuza , Herod's steward , and Susanna , and many others who provided for them out of their means .
42008004	And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him , he said in a parable :
42008005	» A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell along the path ; and it was trampled down , and the birds of the air devoured it .
42008006	Some fell on the rock ; and as it grew up , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
42008007	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it .
42008008	But others fell on good soil , sprang up , and yielded a crop a hundredfold . « When he had said this he called out , » He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! «
42008009	When his disciples asked him what this parable meant ,
42008010	he said , » To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God ; but to others it is given in parables , so that ‘ Seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . ’
42008011	» Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
42008012	The ones along the path are those who hear ; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts , that they may not believe and be saved .
42008013	And the ones on the rock are those who , when they hear the word , receive it with joy ; but these have no root , they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away .
42008014	And the ones that fell among the thorns , they are those who hear , but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life , and their fruit does not mature .
42008015	But the ones that fell on the good soil are those who , having heard the word with a noble and good heart , keep it and bear fruit with patience .
42008016	» No one , when he has lit a lamp , covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed , but puts it on a lampstand , that those who enter may see the light .
42008017	For nothing is secret that will not be revealed , nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light .
42008018	Therefore take heed how you hear . For whoever has , to him more will be given ; and whoever does not have , even what he thinks he has will be taken from him . «
42008019	Then his mother and his brothers came to him , but they could not reach him because of the crowd .
42008020	And it was told him , » Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , desiring to see you . «
42008021	But he said to them , » My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it . «
42008022	One day he got into a boat with his disciples , and he said to them , » Let us go over to the other side of the lake . « So they set out .
42008023	As they sailed he fell asleep . And a windstorm came down on the lake , and they were filling with water , and were in danger .
42008024	And they went and woke him , saying , » Master , Master , we are perishing ! « Then he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves ; and they ceased , and there was a calm .
42008025	He said to them , » Where is your faith ? « And they were afraid , and they marveled , saying to one another , » Who then is this , that he commands even the winds and water , and they obey him ? «
42008026	Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42008027	When he stepped out on land , there met him a man from the city who had demons . For a long time he had worn no clothes , and he lived not in a house but in the tombs .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell down before him , and said with a loud voice , » What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , do not torment me ! «
42008029	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For many times it had seized him , and he was kept under guard , bound with chains and shackles ; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness .
42008030	Jesus asked him , » What is your name ? « And he said , » Legion « ; because many demons had entered him .
42008031	And they begged him repeatedly not to command them to go into the Abyss .
42008032	Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside ; and they begged him to let them enter them . So he gave them permission .
42008033	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned .
42008034	When those tending the pigs saw what had happened , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country .
42008035	Then people went out to see what had happened , and they came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had gone , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
42008036	Those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed .
42008037	Then all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them , for they were seized with great fear . So he got into the boat and returned .
42008038	The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him ; but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	» Return to your home , and tell how much God has done for you . « And he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him .
42008040	Now when Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
42008041	And behold , there came a man named Jairus , who was a ruler of the synagogue ; and he fell at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house ,
42008042	for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . But as he went , the people pressed round him .
42008043	And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone ,
42008044	came up behind him , and touched the fringe of his garment ; and immediately her flow of blood stopped .
42008045	And Jesus said , » Who touched me ? « When all denied it , Peter said , » Master , the multitudes surround you and press upon you ! «
42008046	But Jesus said , » Someone touched me ; for I know that power has gone out from me . «
42008047	When the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him , and how she had been immediately healed .
42008048	And he said to her , » Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace . «
42008049	While he was still speaking , someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said , » Your daughter is dead ; do not trouble the Teacher any more . «
42008050	But Jesus on hearing this answered him , » Do not be afraid ; only believe , and she will be well . «
42008051	When he came into the house he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter , James , and John , and the father and mother of the girl .
42008052	Now all were wailing and mourning for her ; but he said , » Do not weep ; she is not dead , but sleeping . «
42008053	And they laughed at him , knowing that she was dead .
42008054	But he took her by the hand and called , saying , » Child , arise . «
42008055	Then her spirit returned , and she got up at once . And he directed that something should be given her to eat .
42008056	And her parents were astonished , but he charged them to tell no one what had happened .
42009001	Then he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases .
42009002	And he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick .
42009003	And he said to them , » Take nothing for the journey , no staff , nor bag , nor bread , nor money ; and do not have two tunics .
42009004	Whatever house you enter , stay there , and from there depart .
42009005	And wherever they do not receive you , when you leave that town , shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them . «
42009006	So they departed and went through the towns , preaching the gospel and healing everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done ; and he was perplexed , because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead ,
42009008	by some that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again .
42009009	And Herod said , » John I have beheaded , but who is this about whom I hear such things ? « So he sought to see him .
42009010	And when the apostles returned , they told him what they had done . Then he took them with him and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida .
42009011	But when the crowds learned it , they followed him ; and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God , and healed those who had need of healing .
42009012	Now the day began to wear away ; and the twelve came and said to him , » Send the crowd away , to go to the surrounding villages and country , to lodge and get provisions ; for we are here in a deserted place . «
42009013	But he said to them , » You give them something to eat . « And they said , » We have no more than five loaves and two fish — unless we go and buy food for all these people . «
42009014	For there were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , » Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each . «
42009015	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
42009016	Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven , he blessed and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the people .
42009017	They all ate and were satisfied , and they took up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over .
42009018	Now it happened that as he was praying alone his disciples were with him ; and he asked them , » Who do the crowds say that I am ? «
42009019	So they answered , » John the Baptist ; but others say Elijah ; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again . «
42009020	And he said to them , » But who do you say that I am ? « And Peter answered , » The Christ of God . «
42009021	But he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one ,
42009022	saying , » The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and on the third day be raised . «
42009023	Then he said to them all , » If anyone would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me .
42009024	For whoever desires to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it .
42009025	For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world , and loses or forfeits himself ?
42009026	For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	But I tell you truly , there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God . «
42009028	Now about eight days after these sayings , he took with him Peter and John and James , and went up on the mountain to pray .
42009029	And as he was praying , the appearance of his face was altered , and his robe became white and glistening .
42009030	And behold , two men talked with him , Moses and Elijah ,
42009031	who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure , which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
42009032	But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep ; and when they were fully awake , they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him .
42009033	As the men were parting from him , Peter said to Jesus , » Master , it is good for us to be here ; and let us make three tabernacles : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah « — not knowing what he said .
42009034	While he was saying this , a cloud came and overshadowed them ; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
42009035	And a voice came out of the cloud , saying , » This is my Son , my Chosen ; listen to him ! «
42009036	When the voice had spoken , Jesus was found alone . But they kept quiet , and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen .
42009037	On the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , a great crowd met him .
42009038	And behold , a man from the crowd cried out , » Teacher , I beg you to look upon my son , for he is my only child .
42009039	And behold , a spirit seizes him , and he suddenly cries out ; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth , and will hardly leave him , bruising him .
42009040	I begged your disciples to cast it out , but they could not . «
42009041	Then Jesus answered , » O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son here . «
42009042	While he was coming , the demon threw him and convulsed him . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	And they were all amazed at the majesty of God . But while everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did , he said to his disciples ,
42009044	» Let these words sink into your ears , for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men . «
42009045	But they did not understand this saying , and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it ; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
42009046	And an argument arose among them as to which of them would be the greatest .
42009047	Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a little child and set him by him ,
42009048	and said to them , » Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me , and whoever receives me receives him who sent me . For he who is least among you all is the one who is great . «
42009049	Now John answered , » Master , we saw a man casting out demons in your name , and we forbade him because he does not follow with us . «
42009050	But Jesus said to him , » Do not forbid him , for he that is not against you is for you . «
42009051	When the time drew near for him to be received up , he set his face to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	And he sent messengers on ahead , who went and entered a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him ;
42009053	but the people did not receive him , because his face was set for Jerusalem .
42009054	And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , » Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? «
42009055	But he turned and rebuked them ,
42009056	and they went on to another village .
42009057	As they were going along the road , a man said to him , » I will follow you wherever you go . «
42009058	And Jesus said to him , » Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . «
42009059	To another he said , » Follow me . « But he said , » Lord , let me first go and bury my father . «
42009060	Jesus said to him , » Let the dead bury their own dead , but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God . «
42009061	Still another said , » I will follow you , Lord ; but first let me go back and say farewell to those at my home . «
42009062	Jesus said to him , » No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God . «
42010001	After this the Lord appointed seventy others , and sent them ahead of him , two by two , into every town and place where he himself was about to go .
42010002	And he said to them , » The harvest is plentiful , but the laborers are few ; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest .
42010003	Go your way ; behold , I send you out as lambs among wolves .
42010004	Carry no purse , no bag , no sandals ; and greet no one on the road .
42010005	Whatever house you enter , first say , ‘ Peace to this house . ’
42010006	And if a son of peace is there , your peace will rest on him ; if not , it will return to you .
42010007	And remain in the same house , eating and drinking what they give , for the laborer deserves his wages . Do not go from house to house .
42010008	Whenever you enter a town and they receive you , eat what is set before you .
42010009	Heal the sick there and say to them , ‘ The kingdom of God has come near to you . ’
42010010	But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you , go into its streets and say ,
42010011	‘ Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet , we wipe off against you . Nevertheless know this , that the kingdom of God has come near . ’
42010012	I tell you , it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town .
42010013	» Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you .
42010015	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades !
42010016	» He who hears you hears me , he who rejects you rejects me , and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me . «
42010017	The seventy returned with joy , saying , » Lord , even the demons are subject to us in your name . «
42010018	And he said to them , » I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Behold , I have given you authority to trample on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy ; and nothing shall hurt you .
42010020	Nevertheless do not rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . «
42010021	At that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said , » I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes . Yes , Father , for so it was your good pleasure .
42010022	All things have been delivered to me by my Father , and no one knows who the Son is except the Father , and who the Father is except the Son , and the one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him . «
42010023	Then he turned to his disciples and said privately , » Blessed are the eyes which see what you see .
42010024	For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it . «
42010025	And behold , a lawyer stood up to put him to the test , saying , » Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? «
42010026	He said to him , » What is written in the law ? How do you read ? «
42010027	And he answered , » ‘ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your mind ’ ; and ‘ your neighbor as yourself . ’ «
42010028	And he said to him , » You have answered right ; do this , and you will live . «
42010029	But he , wanting to justify himself , said to Jesus , » And who is my neighbor ? «
42010030	Jesus said : » A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he fell among robbers , who stripped him of his clothing , beat him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
42010031	Now by chance a priest was going down that road , and when he saw him he passed by on the other side .
42010032	So likewise , a Levite , when he came to the place and saw him , passed by on the other side .
42010033	But a Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was ; and when he saw him , he had compassion .
42010034	He went to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring on oil and wine ; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
42010035	The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said , ‘ Take care of him ; and whatever more you spend , I will repay you when I come back . ’
42010036	Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers ? «
42010037	He said , » The one who showed mercy on him . « And Jesus said to him , » Go and do likewise . «
42010038	Now as they went on their way , he entered a village ; and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house .
42010039	And she had a sister called Mary , who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his word .
42010040	But Martha was distracted with much serving ; and she went to him and said , » Lord , do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Tell her then to help me . «
42010041	But the Lord answered her , » Martha , Martha , you are worried and troubled about many things ;
42010042	but only one thing is needed . And Mary has chosen that good part , which will not be taken away from her . «
42011001	He was praying in a certain place , and when he ceased , one of his disciples said to him , » Lord , teach us to pray , as John taught his disciples . «
42011002	He said to them , » When you pray , say : ‘ Father , hallowed be your name . Your kingdom come .
42011003	
42011004	
42011005	And he said to them , » Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ;
42011006	for a friend of mine has come to me on a journey , and I have nothing to set before him ’ ;
42011007	and he will answer from within , ‘ Do not bother me ; the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I cannot get up and give you anything ’ ?
42011008	I tell you , though he will not get up and give to him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as much as he needs .
42011009	So I say to you , ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
42011010	For everyone who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .
42011011	What father among you , if his son asks for a fish , will instead of a fish give him a serpent ?
42011012	Or if he asks for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
42011013	If you then , who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! «
42011014	Now he was casting out a demon that was mute . So it was , when the demon had gone out , that the mute man spoke ; and the multitudes marveled .
42011015	But some of them said , » He casts out demons by Beelzebub , the prince of demons . «
42011016	Others , testing him , sought from him a sign from heaven .
42011017	But he , knowing their thoughts , said to them : » Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and a house divided against itself falls .
42011018	If Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub .
42011019	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
42011020	But if I cast out demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
42011021	When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his goods are in peace .
42011022	But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him , he takes away his armor in which he trusted , and divides his spoils .
42011023	He who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters .
42011024	» When an unclean spirit goes out of a man , he goes through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came . ’
42011025	And when he comes , he finds it swept and put in order .
42011026	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter and dwell there ; and the last state of that man is worse than the first . «
42011027	As he said these things , a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him , » Blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breasts that nursed you ! «
42011028	But he said , » Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it ! «
42011029	When the crowds were increasing , he began to say , » This is an evil generation . It seeks a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah .
42011030	For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so also the Son of Man will be to this generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them ; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , one greater than Jonah is here .
42011033	» No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a secret place or under a basket , but on a stand , that those who come in may see the light .
42011034	Your eye is the lamp of your body . When your eye is good , your whole body also is full of light . But when it is bad , your body also is full of darkness .
42011035	Therefore be careful that the light in you is not darkness .
42011036	If then your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be completely lighted , as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light . «
42011037	While he was speaking , a Pharisee asked him to dine with him ; so he went in and sat at table .
42011038	The Pharisee was surprised to see that he did not first wash before dinner .
42011039	But the Lord said to him , » Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish , but inside you are full of greed and wickedness .
42011040	You foolish ones ! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also ?
42011041	But give for alms those things which are within ; and behold , everything is clean for you .
42011042	But woe to you Pharisees ! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and neglect justice and the love of God . These you ought to have done , without leaving the others undone .
42011043	Woe to you Pharisees ! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces .
42011044	Woe to you ! For you are like graves which are not seen , and men walk over them without knowing it . «
42011045	One of the lawyers answered him , » Teacher , by saying these things you reproach us also . «
42011046	And he said , » Woe to you also , lawyers ! For you load men with burdens hard to bear , and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
42011047	Woe to you ! For you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
42011048	So you witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers ; for they killed them , and you build their tombs .
42011049	Therefore the wisdom of God also said , ‘ I will send them prophets and apostles , some of whom they will kill and persecute , ’
42011050	that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation ,
42011051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who perished between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , it shall be required of this generation .
42011052	Woe to you lawyers ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge . You did not enter in yourselves , and you hindered those who were entering . «
42011053	As he went away from there , the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard , and to provoke him to speak of many things ,
42011054	lying in wait for him , to catch at something he might say .
42012001	In the meantime , when so many thousands of the multitude had gathered together that they trampled one another , he began to say to his disciples first of all , » Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known .
42012003	Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops .
42012004	» I tell you , my friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
42012005	But I will show you whom you should fear : fear him who , after he has killed , has power to cast into hell ; yes , I tell you , fear him !
42012006	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? And not one of them is forgotten before God .
42012007	Indeed , the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not ; you are of more value than many sparrows .
42012008	» I tell you , whoever acknowledges me before men , the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God .
42012009	But he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God .
42012010	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven ; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	Now when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and authorities , do not worry about how or what you should answer , or what you are to say ;
42012012	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say . «
42012013	Someone in the crowd said to him , » Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . «
42012014	But he said to him , » Man , who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you ? «
42012015	And he said to them , » Take heed , and beware of all covetousness ; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions . «
42012016	And he told them a parable , saying : » The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully .
42012017	And he thought to himself , ‘ What shall I do , since I have no place to store my crops ? ’
42012018	And he said , ‘ I will do this : I will pull down my barns and build larger ones ; and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
42012019	And I will say to my soul , » Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years ; take your ease ; eat , drink , and be merry . « ’
42012020	But God said to him , ‘ Fool ! This night your soul will be required of you ; then whose will those things be which you have prepared ? ’
42012021	So is he who lays up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . «
42012022	Then he said to his disciples , » Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat ; nor about your body , what you will put on .
42012023	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens : they neither sow nor reap , they have neither storehouse nor barn , and yet God feeds them . Of how much more value are you than the birds !
42012025	And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his span of life ?
42012026	If you then are not able to do this very little thing , why are you anxious about the rest ?
42012027	Consider the lilies , how they grow ; they neither toil nor spin ; yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
42012028	But if God so clothes the grass , which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith !
42012029	And do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink , nor have an anxious mind .
42012030	For all the nations of the world seek after these things , and your Father knows that you need them .
42012031	But seek his kingdom , and these things will be given to you as well .
42012032	Do not fear , little flock , for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell your possessions , and give alms ; provide yourselves purses that do not grow old , a treasure in the heavens that does not fail , where no thief approaches and no moth destroys .
42012034	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
42012035	» Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning ,
42012036	and be like men who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding feast , so that they may open to him immediately when he comes and knocks .
42012037	Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching when he comes . Truly , I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit at table , and will come and serve them .
42012038	If he comes in the second watch , or in the third , and finds them so , blessed are those servants .
42012039	But know this , that if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
42012040	Therefore you also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect . «
42012041	Peter said , » Lord , are you telling this parable to us , or to all ? «
42012042	And the Lord said , » Who then is the faithful and wise steward , whom his master will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the proper time ?
42012043	Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes .
42012044	Truly , I say to you , he will set him over all his possessions .
42012045	But if that servant says to himself , ‘ My master is delayed in coming , ’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
42012046	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him , and at an hour he is not aware of , and he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers .
42012047	And that servant who knew his master's will , and did not ready himself or do according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
42012048	But he who did not know , and committed things deserving of stripes , shall be beaten with few . From everyone who has been given much , much will be required ; and to whom they entrusted much , of him they will ask the more .
42012049	» I came to cast fire on the earth , and how I wish it were already kindled !
42012050	But I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
42012051	Do you think that I came to give peace on earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division .
42012052	For from now on there will be five in one house divided : three against two , and two against three .
42012053	
42012054	He also said to the multitudes , » When you see a cloud rising in the west , immediately you say , » A shower is coming ’ ; and so it happens .
42012055	And when you see the south wind blowing , you say , ‘ There will be hot weather ’ ; and there is .
42012056	You hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky ; but how is it you do not know how to interpret this present time ?
42012057	» And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	As you go with your adversary to the magistrate , make an effort to settle with him on the way , lest he drag you to the judge , and the judge hand you over to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will not get out till you have paid the very last copper . «
42013001	There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
42013002	And Jesus answered them , » Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans , because they suffered this way ?
42013003	I tell you , no ; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish .
42013004	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them , do you think that they were worse sinners than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem ?
42013005	I tell you , no ; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish . «
42013006	He told this parable : » A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it and found none .
42013007	So he said to the keeper of his vineyard , ‘ Look , for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none . Cut it down ; why should it use up the ground ? ’
42013008	And he answered him , ‘ Sir , let it alone this year also , until I dig around it and fertilize it .
42013009	And if it bears fruit next year , fine ; but if not , you can cut it down . ’ «
42013010	Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
42013011	And there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years ; she was bent over and could not straighten up at all .
42013012	When Jesus saw her , he called her forward and said to her , » Woman , you are freed from your infirmity . «
42013013	And he laid his hands on her , and immediately she was made straight , and praised God .
42013014	But the ruler of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , said to the people , » There are six days on which work ought to be done ; come on those days and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day . «
42013015	Then the Lord answered him , » You hypocrites ! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall , and lead it away to water it ?
42013016	Then ought not this woman , a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound for eighteen years , be loosed on the Sabbath day from this bond ? «
42013017	When he said this , all his adversaries were put to shame ; and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him .
42013018	Then he said , » What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his garden ; and it grew and became a tree , and the birds of the air nested in its branches . «
42013020	And again he said , » To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened . «
42013022	He went on his way through towns and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
42013023	Then one said to him , » Lord , will those who are saved be few ? « And he said to them ,
42013024	» Strive to enter through the narrow door , for many , I tell you , will seek to enter and will not be able .
42013025	When once the owner of the house has risen up and shut the door , you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door , saying , ‘ Lord , open for us . ’ He will answer you , ‘ I do not know where you come from . ’
42013026	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . ’
42013027	But he will say , ‘ I tell you , I do not know where you come from . Depart from me , all you workers of iniquity ! ’
42013028	There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
42013029	And men will come from east and west , and from north and south , and sit at table in the kingdom of God .
42013030	And behold , some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last . «
42013031	At that very time some Pharisees came , and said to him , » Get away from here , for Herod wants to kill you . «
42013032	And he said to them , » Go and tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I finish my course . ’
42013033	Nevertheless I must journey today and tomorrow , and the day following ; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem .
42013034	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you ! How often I have longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her brood under her wings , but you were not willing !
42013035	Behold , your house is left to you desolate . And I tell you , you will not see me again until you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ «
42014001	One Sabbath , when he went to dine at the house of a ruler who belonged to the Pharisees , they watched him .
42014002	And behold , there was a man before him who had dropsy .
42014003	And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , » Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? «
42014004	But they kept silent . And he took him and healed him , and let him go .
42014005	Then he said to them , » Which of you , having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well , will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day ? «
42014006	And they could not reply to this .
42014007	So he told a parable to those who were invited , when he noted how they chose the places of honor , saying to them :
42014008	» When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast , do not sit down in a place of honor , lest one more distinguished than you be invited by him ;
42014009	and he who invited you both will come and say to you , ‘ Give place to this man , ’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place .
42014010	But when you are invited , go and sit in the lowest place , so that when your host comes he may say to you , ‘ Friend , go up higher . ’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you .
42014011	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted . «
42014012	Then he also said to the one who invited him , » When you give a luncheon or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers , your relatives or rich neighbors , lest they also invite you back , and you be repaid .
42014013	But when you give a feast , invite the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind ,
42014014	and you will be blessed , because they cannot repay you . You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just . «
42014015	When one of those who sat at table with him heard this , he said to him , » Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God ! «
42014016	Then he said to him , » A certain man gave a great banquet and invited many .
42014017	And at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited , ‘ Come , for all is now ready . ’
42014018	But they all alike began to make excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I have bought a field , and I must go out and see it . I ask you to have me excused . ’
42014019	And another said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to test them . I ask you to have me excused . ’
42014020	Still another said , ‘ I have married a wife , and therefore I cannot come . ’
42014021	So the servant came back and reported this to his master . Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and the maimed , the blind and the lame . ’
42014022	And the servant said , ‘ Sir , what you commanded has been done , and still there is room . ’
42014023	Then the master said to the servant , ‘ Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
42014024	For I tell you , none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet . ’ «
42014025	Now great multitudes went with him ; and he turned and said to them ,
42014026	» If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother , wife and children , brothers and sisters , yes , and even his own life , he cannot be my disciple .
42014027	And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple .
42014028	For which of you , intending to build a tower , does not sit down first and count the cost , whether he has enough to complete it ?
42014029	Otherwise , when he has laid the foundation , and is not able to finish , all who see it begin to mock him ,
42014030	saying , ‘ This man began to build , and was not able to finish . ’
42014031	Or what king , going to make war against another king , will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	And if not , while the other is still a great way off , he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace .
42014033	So likewise , whoever of you does not give up all that he has cannot be my disciple .
42014034	Salt is good ; but if the salt has lost its taste , how shall it be seasoned ?
42014035	It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill ; men throw it out . He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! «
42015001	Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him .
42015002	And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , » This man receives sinners and eats with them . «
42015003	So he told them this parable :
42015004	» What man of you , having a hundred sheep , if he loses one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness , and go after the one which is lost until he finds it ?
42015005	And when he has found it , he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost . ’
42015007	I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance .
42015008	» Or what woman , having ten silver coins , if she loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it ?
42015009	And when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin which I had lost . ’
42015010	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents . «
42015011	Then he said : » There was a man who had two sons .
42015012	And the younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of property that falls to me . ’ So he divided his living between them .
42015013	Not many days after , the younger son gathered together all he had and took his journey into a far country , and there he squandered his property in loose living .
42015014	And when he had spent everything , there arose a severe famine in that country , and he began to be in want .
42015015	So he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed swine .
42015016	And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate , and no one gave him anything .
42015017	But when he came to himself , he said , ‘ How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare , and here I perish with hunger !
42015018	I will arise and go to my father and will say to him , » Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you .
42015019	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; make me like one of your hired servants . « ’
42015020	And he arose and came to his father . But while he was still a great way off , his father saw him and had compassion for him , and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him .
42015021	And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son . ’
42015022	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Bring out the best robe and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet .
42015023	And bring the fatted calf and kill it , and let us eat and be merry ;
42015024	for this my son was dead and is alive again ; he was lost and is found . ’ And they began to be merry .
42015025	» Now his older son was in the field . And as he came and drew near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant .
42015027	And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fatted calf , because he has received him safe and sound . ’
42015028	But he was angry and refused to go in . So his father came out and pleaded with him .
42015029	But he answered his father , ‘ Behold , these many years I have been serving you , and I never disobeyed your command ; yet you never gave me a young goat , that I might make merry with my friends .
42015030	But when this son of yours came , who has devoured your living with harlots , you killed for him the fatted calf ! ’
42015031	And he said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and all that I have is yours .
42015032	It was right that we should make merry and be glad , for this your brother was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . ’ «
42016001	He also said to his disciples : » There was a certain rich man who had a steward , and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods .
42016002	So he called him and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give an account of your stewardship , for you can no longer be steward . ’
42016003	The steward said to himself , ‘ What shall I do , since my master is taking the stewardship away from me ? I am not strong enough to dig , and I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	I have decided what to do , so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship . ’
42016005	So he called in each one of his master's debtors , and he said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
42016006	And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of oil . ’ So he said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . ’
42016007	Then he said to another , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of wheat . ’ He said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and write eighty . ’
42016008	So the master commended the dishonest steward because he had dealt shrewdly . For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light .
42016009	And I tell you , make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon , so that when it fails , they may receive you into the eternal dwellings .
42016010	He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much ; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much .
42016011	If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will trust you with the true riches ?
42016012	And if you have not been faithful in what is another's , who will give you what is your own ?
42016013	No servant can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or else he will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and mammon . «
42016014	The Pharisees , who were lovers of money , heard all this , and they scoffed at him .
42016015	He said to them , » You are those who justify yourselves before men , but God knows your hearts . For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
42016016	The law and the prophets were until John . Since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached , and everyone is forcing his way into it .
42016017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one dot of the law to fail .
42016018	Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery .
42016019	» There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day .
42016020	And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
42016021	longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table . Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	So the beggar died , and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom . The rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	And in Hades , being in torment , he lifted up his eyes , and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom .
42016024	And he called out , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy upon me , and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue ; for I am in agony in this flame . ’
42016025	But Abraham said , ‘ Son , remember that in your lifetime you received your good things , and Lazarus received evil things ; but now he is comforted here and you are in agony .
42016026	And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been fixed , so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot , nor can anyone cross over from there to us . ’
42016027	And he said , ‘ Then I beg you , father , to send him to my father's house ,
42016028	for I have five brothers , so that he may warn them , lest they also come to this place of torment . ’
42016029	Abraham said to him , ‘ They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them . ’
42016030	And he said , ‘ No , father Abraham ; but if someone goes to them from the dead , they will repent . ’
42016031	He said to him , ‘ If they do not hear Moses and the prophets , neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead . ’ «
42017001	Then he said to his disciples , » Things that cause people to sin are bound to come , but woe to him through whom they do come !
42017002	It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea , than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin .
42017003	Take heed to yourselves ; if your brother sins , rebuke him , and if he repents , forgive him .
42017004	And if he sins against you seven times in a day , and turns to you seven times , and says , ‘ I repent , ’ you must forgive him . «
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , » Increase our faith ! «
42017006	So the Lord said , » If you have faith as a mustard seed , you can say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and be planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	» Will any one of you , who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep , say to him when he has come in from the field , ‘ Come at once and sit down to eat ’ ?
42017008	Will he not rather say to him , ‘ Prepare my supper , and gird yourself and serve me , till I eat and drink ; and afterward you shall eat and drink' ?
42017009	Does he thank the servant because he did what he was commanded ?
42017010	So you also , when you have done all that is commanded you , say , ‘ We are unworthy servants ; we have only done what was our duty . ’ «
42017011	On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he entered a village , ten men who were lepers met him , who stood at a distance .
42017013	And they lifted up their voices and said , » Jesus , Master , have mercy on us ! «
42017014	When he saw them , he said to them , » Go , show yourselves to the priests . « And as they went , they were cleansed .
42017015	Then one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , praising God with a loud voice ;
42017016	and he fell on his face at Jesus’ feet , giving him thanks . And he was a Samaritan .
42017017	Then said Jesus , » Were not ten cleansed ? Where are the nine ?
42017018	Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner ? «
42017019	And he said to him , » Rise and go your way ; your faith has made you well . «
42017020	Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , he answered them , » The kingdom of God does not come with observation ;
42017021	nor will they say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or ‘ There ! ’ for behold , the kingdom of God is within you . «
42017022	Then he said to the disciples , » The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
42017023	And they will say to you , ‘ Look here ! ’ or ‘ Look there ! ’ Do not go after them or follow them .
42017024	For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one part to the other , so will the Son of Man be in his day .
42017025	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	Just as it was in the days of Noah , so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man .
42017027	They ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day when Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	Likewise as it was in the days of Lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
42017029	but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all .
42017030	So will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed .
42017031	On that day , let him who is on the housetop , with his goods in the house , not come down to take them away . And likewise let him who is in the field not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife .
42017033	Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life will preserve it .
42017034	I tell you , on that night there will be two in one bed ; one will be taken and the other left .
42017035	Two women will be grinding together ; one will be taken and the other left . «
42017037	And they said to him , » Where , Lord ? « He said to them , » Where the body is , there the eagles will be gathered together . «
42018001	Then he told them a parable , to show that they ought always to pray and not lose heart .
42018002	He said : » In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man .
42018003	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying , ‘ Grant me justice against my adversary . ’
42018004	For a while he refused ; but afterward he said to himself , ‘ Though I neither fear God nor regard man ,
42018005	yet because this widow bothers me , I will give her justice , or she will wear me out by her continual coming . ’ «
42018006	And the Lord said , » Hear what the unjust judge says .
42018007	And will not God bring about justice for his elect , who cry to him day and night ? Will he delay long over them ?
42018008	I tell you that he will bring about justice for them speedily . Nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? «
42018009	Also he told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
42018010	» Two men went up to the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other men — extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week ; I give tithes of all that I get . ’
42018013	But the tax collector , standing far off , would not even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ‘ God , be merciful to me a sinner ! ’
42018014	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted . «
42018015	Now they were also bringing infants to him that he might touch them ; but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
42018016	But Jesus called them to him and said , » Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them ; for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
42018017	Truly , I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it . «
42018018	Now a certain ruler asked him , » Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? «
42018019	So Jesus said to him , » Why do you call me good ? No one is good but God alone .
42018020	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery , Do not murder , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor your father and mother . ’ «
42018021	And he said , » All these I have kept from my youth . «
42018022	When Jesus heard it , he said to him , » One thing you still lack . Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . «
42018023	But when he heard this , he became very sad , for he was extremely rich .
42018024	Jesus looked at him and said , » How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God !
42018025	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . «
42018026	Those who heard it said , » Then who can be saved ? «
42018027	But he said , » What is impossible with men is possible with God . «
42018028	Then Peter said , » Behold , we have left all and followed you . «
42018029	So he said to them , » Truly , I say to you , there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
42018030	who will not receive many times more in this time , and in the age to come eternal life . «
42018031	Then he took the twelve aside and said to them , » Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and everything that is written of the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished .
42018032	For he will be delivered to the Gentiles , and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon .
42018033	They will scourge him and kill him , and on the third day he will rise again . «
42018034	But they understood none of these things ; this saying was hidden from them , and they did not know what he was talking about .
42018035	As he drew near to Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
42018036	And hearing a multitude going by , he asked what this meant .
42018037	They told him , » Jesus of Nazareth is passing by . «
42018038	And he cried out , » Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! «
42018039	And those who led the way rebuked him , telling him to be quiet ; but he cried out all the more , » Son of David , have mercy on me ! «
42018040	So Jesus stopped , and commanded him to be brought to him . And when he came near , he asked him ,
42018041	» What do you want me to do for you ? « He said , » Lord , I want to receive my sight . «
42018042	And Jesus said to him , » Receive your sight ; your faith has made you well . «
42018043	And immediately he received his sight and followed him , glorifying God . And all the people , when they saw it , gave praise to God .
42019001	Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through .
42019002	Now behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus ; he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
42019003	And he sought to see who Jesus was , but could not because of the crowd , for he was of short stature .
42019004	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him , for he was to pass that way .
42019005	And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and said to him , » Zacchaeus , make haste and come down ; for I must stay at your house today . «
42019006	So he made haste and came down , and received him joyfully .
42019007	And when they saw it they all murmured , » He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner . «
42019008	And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , » Look , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have defrauded any one of anything , I restore it fourfold . «
42019009	And Jesus said to him , » Today salvation has come to this house , because he also is a son of Abraham .
42019010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost . «
42019011	As they heard these things , he went on to tell a parable , because he was near to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately .
42019012	Therefore he said : » A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return .
42019013	So he called ten of his servants , gave them ten minas , and said to them , ‘ Do business till I come . ’
42019014	But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this man to reign over us . ’
42019015	And so it was that when he returned , having received the kingdom , he then commanded these servants , to whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by trading .
42019016	Then came the first , saying , ‘ Master , your mina has earned ten minas more . ’
42019017	And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good servant ! Because you have been faithful in a very little , be in authority over ten cities . ’
42019018	And the second came , saying , ‘ Master , your mina has earned five minas . ’
42019019	Likewise he said to him , ‘ You also be over five cities . ’
42019020	Then another came , saying , ‘ Master , here is your mina , which I have kept laid away in a handkerchief ;
42019021	for I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You take up what you did not lay down , and reap what you did not sow . ’
42019022	He said to him , ‘ I will judge you out of your own mouth , you wicked servant ! You knew that I was a hard man , taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow ?
42019023	Why then did you not put my money in the bank , that at my coming I might have collected it with interest ? ’
42019024	And he said to those who stood by , ‘ Take the mina from him , and give it to him who has ten minas . ’
42019025	And they said to him , ‘ Master , he has ten minas already ! ’
42019026	‘ I tell you , that to every one who has will more be given ; but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
42019027	But those enemies of mine , who did not want me to reign over them , bring them here and slay them before me . ’ «
42019028	When he had said this , he went on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	When he came near to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount that is called Olivet , he sent two of the disciples ,
42019030	saying , » Go into the village opposite you , where as you enter you will find a colt tied , on which no one has ever sat . Untie it and bring it here .
42019031	If any one asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ you shall say to him , ‘ The Lord has need of it . ’ «
42019032	So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them .
42019033	And as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , » Why are you untying the colt ? «
42019034	And they said , » The Lord has need of it . «
42019035	And they brought it to Jesus , and they threw their garments on the colt and set Jesus on it .
42019036	And as he went along , many spread their garments on the road .
42019037	And , as he was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen ,
42019038	saying , » Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! «
42019039	And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him , » Teacher , rebuke your disciples . «
42019040	He answered , » I tell you , if these keep silent , the stones would cry out . «
42019041	And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it ,
42019042	saying , » If you had known , even you , this day , the things that make for peace ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you , and surround you and hem you in on every side ,
42019044	and dash you to the ground , you and your children within you , and they will not leave one stone upon another in you ; because you did not know the time of your visitation . «
42019045	Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold ,
42019046	saying to them , » It is written , ‘ My house shall be a house of prayer ’ ; but you have made it a den of robbers . «
42019047	And he was teaching daily in the temple . But the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him ,
42019048	but they could not find anything they could do , for all the people hung upon his words .
42020001	One day as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes , together with the elders , came up to him
42020002	and said to him , » Tell us by what authority are you doing these things ? Or who it is that gave you this authority . «
42020003	He answered them , » I also will ask you a question ; now tell me ,
42020004	the baptism of John — was it from heaven or from men ? «
42020005	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , » If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ all the people will stone us , for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . «
42020007	So they answered that they did not know where it was from .
42020008	And Jesus said to them , » Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . «
42020009	Then he began to tell the people this parable : » A man planted a vineyard , leased it to vine-dressers , and went into another country for a long time .
42020010	At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants , that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	He sent another servant ; him also they beat and treated shamefully , and sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	He sent a third ; and they wounded him and cast him out .
42020013	Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; perhaps they will respect him . ’
42020014	But when the tenants saw him , they reasoned among themselves and said , ‘ This is the heir . Let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . ’
42020015	So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and destroy those tenants , and give the vineyard to others . « When they heard this , they said , » May this never be ! «
42020017	But he looked at them and said , » What then is this that is written : ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone ’ ?
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces ; but on whomever it falls , it will grind him to powder . «
42020019	The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour , but they feared the people — for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them .
42020020	So they watched him , and sent spies who pretended to be righteous , that they might catch him on what he said , in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor .
42020021	And they asked him , » Teacher , we know that you speak and teach rightly , and you do not show partiality , but teach the way of God in truth .
42020022	Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? «
42020023	But he perceived their craftiness , and said to them ,
42020024	» Show me a denarius . Whose likeness and inscription does it have ? « They said , » Caesar’s . «
42020025	He said to them , » Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . «
42020026	And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said . But marveling at his answer they were silent .
42020027	Some of the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him ,
42020028	and they questioned him , » Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies , having a wife but no children , the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother .
42020029	Now there were seven brothers . The first took a wife , and died without children .
42020030	And the second
42020031	and then the third took her , and in the same way the seven died , and they left no children .
42020032	Finally the woman died also .
42020033	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife will she be ? For all seven had her as wife . «
42020034	And Jesus said to them , » The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage .
42020035	But those who are considered worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage ,
42020036	nor can they die any more , for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
42020037	But that the dead are raised , even Moses showed , in the passage about the bush , where he calls the Lord ‘ the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob . ’
42020038	Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living , for all live to him . «
42020039	And some of the scribes answered , » Teacher , you have spoken well . «
42020040	For they no longer dared to ask him any question .
42020041	And he said to them , » How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
42020042	For David himself says in the Book of Psalms , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , » Sit at my right hand ,
42020043	
42020044	David therefore calls him ‘ Lord , ’ and how is he his son ? «
42020045	And in the hearing of all the people , he said to his disciples ,
42020046	» Beware of the scribes , who like to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts ,
42020047	who devour widows’ houses and for a pretense make long prayers . They will receive greater condemnation . «
42021001	He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury ,
42021002	and he also saw a poor widow put in two copper coins .
42021003	So he said , » Truly I tell you , this poor widow has put in more than all of the others ;
42021004	for these all contributed out of their abundance , but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on . «
42021005	And as some spoke of the temple , how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings , he said ,
42021006	» As for these things which you see , the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down . «
42021007	So they asked him , » Teacher , when will these things be ? And what will be the sign when they are about to take place ? «
42021008	And he said : » Take heed that you not are deceived . For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and , ‘ The time is near . ’ Do not go after them .
42021009	And when you hear of wars and revolutions , do not be terrified ; for these things must first take place , but the end will not come immediately . «
42021010	Then he said to them , » Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	There will be great earthquakes , and in various places famines and pestilences ; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven .
42021012	But before all this , they will lay their hands on you and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons . And you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake .
42021013	This will turn into an opportunity for you to bear testimony .
42021014	Therefore settle it in your minds not to meditate beforehand how you will answer ;
42021015	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict .
42021016	You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers , relatives and friends ; and they will put some of you to death .
42021017	You will be hated by all for my name's sake .
42021018	But not a hair of your head will perish .
42021019	By your endurance you will gain your lives .
42021020	» But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then know that its desolation is near .
42021021	Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains , let those who are in the city depart , and let not those who are out in the country enter it .
42021022	For these are days of vengeance , to fulfil all that is written .
42021023	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days ! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people .
42021024	They will fall by the edge of the sword , and be led captive to all nations . Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
42021025	» There will be signs in sun and moon and stars , and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves ,
42021026	men fainting from fear and foreboding of what is coming on the world , for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42021027	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
42021028	Now when these things begin to take place , look up and lift up your heads , because your redemption is drawing near . «
42021029	He told them a parable : » Look at the fig tree , and all the trees .
42021030	When they are sprouting , you see and know for yourselves that summer is already near .
42021031	So you also , when you see these things happening , know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	Truly , I say to you , this generation will not pass away till all things take place .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
42021034	» But take heed to yourselves , lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life , and that Day come on you unexpectedly like a trap .
42021035	For it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth .
42021036	Watch at all times , and pray always that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place , and to stand before the Son of Man . «
42021037	And every day he was teaching in the temple , but at night he went out to spend the night on the mount called Olivet .
42021038	And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him .
42022001	Now the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near , which is called the Passover .
42022002	And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to kill him , for they feared the people .
42022003	Then Satan entered Judas , called Iscariot , who was numbered of the twelve .
42022004	So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and officers , how he might betray him to them .
42022005	And they were glad , and agreed to give him money .
42022006	So he consented , and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude .
42022007	Then came the day of Unleavened Bread , on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
42022008	So he sent Peter and John , saying , » Go and prepare the Passover for us , that we may eat . «
42022009	They said to him , » Where do you want us to prepare it ? «
42022010	He said to them , » Behold , when you have entered the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you ; follow him into the house which he enters .
42022011	And say to the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says to you : Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’
42022012	He will show you a large , furnished upper room ; there make ready . «
42022013	So they went , and found it just as he had told them ; and they prepared the Passover .
42022014	When the hour came , he sat at table , and the apostles with him .
42022015	And he said to them , » I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ;
42022016	for I tell you , I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . «
42022017	Then he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , » Take this and divide it among yourselves ;
42022018	for I tell you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes . «
42022019	And he took bread , gave thanks and broke it , and gave it to them , saying , » This is my body which is given for you ; do this in remembrance of me . «
42022020	Likewise he took the cup after supper , saying , » This cup is the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
42022021	But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table .
42022022	For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined , but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed ! «
42022023	Then they began to question among themselves , which of them it was who would do this .
42022024	A dispute also arose among them , which of them was to be considered the greatest .
42022025	And he said to them , » The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors .
42022026	But not so among you ; on the contrary , he who is greatest among you , let him be as the youngest , and he who leads as one who serves .
42022027	For who is greater , one who sits at the table , or one who serves ? Is it not the one who sits at the table ? But I am among you as One who serves .
42022028	You are those who have continued with me in my trials .
42022029	And I bestow on you a kingdom , just as my Father bestowed one on me ,
42022030	so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	» Simon , Simon , behold , Satan has asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat .
42022032	But I have prayed for you , that your faith may not fail ; and when you have turned again , strengthen your brethren . «
42022033	But he said to him , » Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death . «
42022034	He said , » I tell you , Peter , the rooster will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me . «
42022035	And he said to them , » When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals , did you lack anything ? « They said , » Nothing . «
42022036	He said to them , » But now , let him who has a purse take it , and likewise a bag ; and let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one .
42022037	For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me , ‘ And he was numbered with transgressors ’ ; for what is written about me has its fulfillment . «
42022038	They said , » Look , Lord , here are two swords . « And he said to them , » It is enough . «
42022039	He came out , and went to the Mount of Olives , as was his custom , and his disciples followed him .
42022040	When he came to the place , he said to them , » Pray that you may not enter into temptation . «
42022041	And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw , and knelt down and prayed ,
42022042	» Father , if you are willing , take this cup from me ; nevertheless not my will , but yours , be done . «
42022043	An angel appeared to him from heaven , and strengthened him .
42022044	And being in agony , he prayed more earnestly , and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground .
42022045	When he rose from prayer , and came to his disciples , he found them sleeping from sorrow .
42022046	He said to them , » Why do you sleep ? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation . «
42022047	While he was still speaking , a crowd came , and the man who was called Judas , one of the twelve , was leading them . He drew near to Jesus to kiss him ;
42022048	but Jesus said to him , » Judas , are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? «
42022049	When those around him saw what was going to happen , they said , » Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? «
42022050	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus answered , » No more of this ! « And he touched his ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to the chief priests , officers of the temple , and the elders who had come to him , » Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
42022053	When I was with you day after day in the temple , you did not lay hands on me . But this is your hour , and the power of darkness . «
42022054	Then they seized him and led him away , bringing him into the high priest’s house . Peter followed at a distance .
42022055	When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together , Peter sat among them .
42022056	And a servant girl , seeing him as he sat in the firelight , looked at him , and said , » This man also was with him . «
42022057	But he denied it , saying , » Woman , I do not know him . «
42022058	And a little later some one else saw him and said , » You also are of them . « But Peter said , » Man , I am not ! «
42022059	Then after about an hour had passed , another insisted , saying , » Certainly this fellow also was with him , for he is a Galilean . «
42022060	But Peter said , » Man , I do not know what you are saying ! « Immediately , while he was still speaking , the rooster crowed .
42022061	And the Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said to him , » Before the rooster crows today , you will deny me three times . «
42022062	And he went out and wept bitterly .
42022063	Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him .
42022064	They blindfolded him and asked him , » Prophesy ! Who is the one who struck you ? «
42022065	And they spoke many other things against him , blaspheming .
42022066	As soon as it was day , the council of the elders of the people came together , both chief priests and scribes ; and they led him away to their council chamber , saying ,
42022067	» If you are the Christ , tell us . « But he said to them , » If I tell you , you will not believe .
42022068	And if I ask you , you will not answer .
42022069	But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . «
42022070	They all said , » Are you the Son of God , then ? « He said to them , » You said what I am . «
42022071	And they said , » What further testimony do we need ? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips . «
42023001	Then the whole body of them arose and led him to Pilate .
42023002	And they began to accuse him , saying , » We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ , a king . «
42023003	So Pilate asked him , » Are you the King of the Jews ? « He answered him , » It is as you say . «
42023004	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd , » I find no crime in this man . «
42023005	But they were urgent , saying , » He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , from Galilee to this place . «
42023006	When Pilate heard this , he asked if the man was a Galilean .
42023007	And when he learned that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who also was in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	Now when Herod saw Jesus , he was very glad , for he had desired to see him for a long time , because he had heard about him , and he hoped to see some miracle done by him .
42023009	Then he questioned him with many words , but he gave him no answer .
42023010	The chief priests and the scribes stood by , vehemently accusing him .
42023011	And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him ; then , dressing him in a gorgeous robe , he sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other , for before this they had been at enmity with each other .
42023013	Pilate then called together the chief priests , the rulers , and the people ,
42023014	and said to them , » You have brought this man to me as one who was inciting the people to rebellion . And behold , having examined him in your presence , I have found no guilt in this man concerning those charges which you make against him ;
42023015	neither did Herod , for he sent him back to us . Behold , nothing deserving death has been done by him ;
42023016	I will therefore chastise him and release him . «
42023018	But they all cried out together , » Away with this man , and release to us Barabbas « —
42023019	a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city , and for murder .
42023020	Wanting to release Jesus , Pilate addressed to them again .
42023021	But they shouted , » Crucify him , crucify him ! «
42023022	Then he said to them the third time , » Why , what evil has he done ? I have found in him no crime deserving death . I will therefore chastise him and release him . «
42023023	But they were insistent , demanding with loud voices that he be crucified . And their voices prevailed .
42023024	So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted .
42023025	And he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , the one they asked for ; but Jesus he delivered up to their will .
42023026	And as they led him away , they seized one Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country , and laid on him the cross , to carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	And a great multitude of the people followed him , and women who also mourned and lamented him .
42023028	But Jesus turning to them said , » Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	For behold , the days are coming when they will say , ‘ Blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore , and the breasts that never nursed ! ’
42023030	
42023031	For if they do these things when the wood is green , what will happen when it is dry ? «
42023032	Two others , criminals , were also led with him to be put to death .
42023033	And when they came to the place called The Skull , there they crucified him , and the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
42023034	Then Jesus said , » Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . « And they divided his garments and cast lots .
42023035	And the people stood watching ; but even the rulers sneered at him , saying , » He saved others ; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God , the Chosen One . «
42023036	The soldiers also mocked him , coming up and offering him wine vinegar ,
42023037	and saying , » If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself . «
42023038	There was also an inscription written over him : THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
42023039	One of the criminals who were hanged there hurled insults at him , saying , » Are you not the Christ ? Save yourself and us ! «
42023040	But the other rebuked him , saying , » Do you not fear God , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ?
42023041	And we indeed justly , for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds ; but this man has done nothing wrong . «
42023042	Then he said , » Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom . «
42023043	And Jesus said to him , » Truly , I say to you , today you will be with me in Paradise . «
42023044	It was now about the sixth hour , and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour ,
42023045	for the sun was darkened ; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two .
42023046	And Jesus , crying out with a loud voice , said , » Father , into your hands I commit my spirit . « And having said this , he breathed his last .
42023047	Now when the centurion saw what had happened , he praised God , and said , » Certainly this was a righteous man ! «
42023048	When all the multitudes who had gathered to witness this sight saw what had taken place , they beat their breasts , and returned home .
42023049	But all his acquaintances , and the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance , watching these things .
42023050	Now there was a man named Joseph , a member of the Council , a good and righteous man ,
42023051	who had not consented to their decision and deed . He came from of Arimathea , a city of the Jews , and he was waiting for the kingdom of God .
42023052	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42023053	Then he took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth , and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock , where no one had ever yet been laid .
42023054	It was the Preparation Day , and the Sabbath was about to begin .
42023055	The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb , and how his body was laid .
42023056	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes .
42023057	
42024001	But on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they came to the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
42024002	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
42024003	but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	While they were perplexed about this , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling apparel .
42024005	And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground , the men said to them , » Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
42024006	He is not here , but is risen ! Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee ,
42024007	‘ The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and on the third day rise again . ’ «
42024008	And they remembered his words .
42024009	Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
42024010	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them , who told this to the apostles .
42024011	But their words seemed to them like idle tales , and they did not believe them .
42024012	But Peter arose and ran to the tomb ; and stooping down , he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves ; and he went away , marveling to himself at what had happened .
42024013	Now behold , that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened .
42024015	While they talked and discussed , Jesus himself drew near and went with them .
42024016	But their eyes were kept from recognizing him .
42024017	And he said to them , » What is this conversation which you are exchanging with each other as you walk ? « And they stood still , looking sad .
42024018	Then one of them , named Cleopas , answered him , » Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days ? «
42024019	And he said to them , » What things ? « And they said to him , » The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ,
42024020	and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
42024021	But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel . Indeed , besides all this , it is the third day since all this happened .
42024022	In addition , some women of our company amazed us . They were at the tomb early in the morning ,
42024023	and when they did not find his body , they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said he was alive .
42024024	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb , and found it just as the women had said ; but him they did not see . «
42024025	And he said to them , » O foolish men , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
42024026	Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter his glory ? «
42024027	And beginning with Moses and all the prophets , he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures .
42024028	As they drew near the village to which they were going , he acted as though he would be going farther ,
42024029	but they constrained him , saying , » Stay with us , for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent . « So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	When he was at the table with them , he took bread , blessed and broke it , and gave it to them .
42024031	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him ; and he vanished from their sight .
42024032	And they said to each other , » Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road , while he opened to us the scriptures ? «
42024033	So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem , and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together ,
42024034	saying , » The Lord has risen indeed , and has appeared to Simon ! «
42024035	Then they told what had happened on the road , and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread .
42024036	As they were saying this , Jesus himself stood among them and said to them , » Peace be with you . «
42024037	But they were startled and frightened , and supposed that they saw a spirit .
42024038	And he said to them , » Why are you troubled , and why do doubts rise in your hearts ?
42024039	See my hands and my feet , that it is I myself . Handle me and see , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have . «
42024040	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
42024041	And while they still did not believe for joy , and marveled , he said to them , » Have you anything here to eat ? «
42024042	They gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
42024043	and he took it and ate in their presence .
42024044	Then he said to them , » These are my words which I spoke to you , while I was still with you , that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled . «
42024045	Then he opened their minds , so they could understand the Scriptures .
42024046	And he said to them , » Thus it is written , that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day ,
42024047	and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you ; but stay in the city , until you are clothed with power from on high . «
42024050	Then he led them out as far as Bethany , and he lifted up his hands and blessed them .
42024051	While he blessed them , he parted from them , and was carried up into heaven .
42024052	Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
42024053	and were continually in the temple praising God .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was with God in the beginning .
43001003	All things were made through him , and without him nothing was made that was made .
43001004	In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness did not comprehend it .
43001006	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	He came for a witness , to bear witness of the light , that all might believe through him .
43001008	He was not the light , but came to bear witness of the light .
43001009	The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world did not know him .
43001011	He came to his own , and his own did not receive him .
43001012	But to all who received him , to those who believed in his name , he gave the right to become children of God —
43001013	who were born , not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man , but of God .
43001014	And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us , and we have seen his glory , the glory as of the only begotten from the Father , full of grace and truth .
43001015	John bore witness of him and cried out , saying , » This was he of whom I said , ‘ He who comes after me ranks before me , for he was before me . ’ «
43001016	And from his fullness have we all received , grace upon grace .
43001017	For the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God ; God the only Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he has made him known .
43001019	Now this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , » Who are you ? «
43001020	He confessed , he did not deny , but confessed , » I am not the Christ . «
43001021	And they asked him , » What then ? Are you Elijah ? « He said , » I am not . « » Are you the prophet ? « And he answered , » No . «
43001022	Then they said to him , » Who are you ? Give us an answer for those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? «
43001023	He said , » I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , ‘ Make straight the way of the Lord , ’ as the prophet Isaiah said . «
43001024	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees .
43001025	They asked him , » Then why do you baptize , if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the prophet ? «
43001026	John answered them , » I baptize with water , but there stands One among you whom you do not know .
43001027	It is he who comes after me , the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie . «
43001028	This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him , and said , » Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is he of whom I said , ‘ After me comes a man who ranks before me , for he was before me . ’
43001031	I myself did not know him ; but for this I came baptizing with water , that he might be revealed to Israel . «
43001032	And John bore witness , » I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven , and it remained on him .
43001033	I did not know him , but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me , ‘ He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain , this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . ’
43001034	And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God . «
43001035	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples .
43001036	And he looked at Jesus as he walked , and said , » Behold , the Lamb of God ! «
43001037	The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Jesus .
43001038	Jesus turned , and saw them following , and said to them , » What do you seek ? « They said to him , » Rabbi « ( which means Teacher ) , » where are you staying ? «
43001039	He said to them , » Come and see . « They came and saw where he was staying ; and they stayed with him that day , for it was about the tenth hour .
43001040	One of the two who heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter's brother .
43001041	He first found his own brother Simon , and said to him , » We have found the Messiah « ( which means the Christ ) .
43001042	He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , » You are Simon son of John . You shall be called Cephas « ( which means Peter ) .
43001043	The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee . And he found Philip and said to him , » Follow me . «
43001044	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and said to him , » We have found him of whom Moses in the law , and also the prophets , wrote – Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . «
43001046	And Nathanael said to him , » Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? « Philip said to him , » Come and see . «
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , and said of him , » Behold , an Israelite indeed , in whom is no deceit ! «
43001048	Nathanael said to him , » How do you know me ? « Jesus answered him , » Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . «
43001049	Nathanael answered him , » Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! You are the King of Israel ! «
43001050	Jesus answered him , » Because I said to you , I saw you under the fig tree , do you believe ? You shall see greater things than these . «
43001051	And he said to him , » Truly , truly , I say to you , you shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man . «
43002001	On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there .
43002002	And Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding .
43002003	When the wine was gone , the mother of Jesus said to him , » They have no wine . «
43002004	Jesus said to her , » Woman , what have you to do with me ? My hour has not yet come . «
43002005	His mother said to the servants , » Do whatever he tells you . «
43002006	Now six stone jars were standing there , according to the manner for purification of the Jews , each holding twenty or thirty gallons .
43002007	Jesus said to them , » Fill the jars with water . « And they filled them up to the brim .
43002008	He said to them , » Now draw some out , and take it to the master of the feast . « So they took it .
43002009	When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and did not know where it had come from ( though the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the master of the feast called the bridegroom .
43002010	And he said to him , » Every man sets out the good wine first ; and when the guests have drunk freely , then the poor wine ; but you have kept the good wine until now . «
43002011	This , the first of his signs , Jesus did at Cana in Galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this he went down to Capernaum , with his mother and his brothers and his disciples ; and there they stayed for a few days .
43002013	The Passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the money-changers at their business .
43002015	And he made a whip of cords , and drove them all , with the sheep and oxen , out of the temple ; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables .
43002016	And he said to those who sold doves , » Take these things away ! You shall not make my Father's house a house of merchandise ! «
43002017	His disciples remembered that it was written , » Zeal for your house will consume me . «
43002018	Then the Jews said to him , » What sign do you show to us , since you do this ? «
43002019	Jesus answered them , » Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . «
43002020	The Jews then said , » It has taken forty-six years to build this temple , and will you raise it up in three days ? «
43002021	But he was speaking of the temple of his body .
43002022	When therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this ; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken .
43002023	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast , many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did .
43002024	But Jesus did not trust himself to them , because he knew all men ,
43002025	and he had no need for anyone to bear witness of man , for he knew what was in man .
43003001	Now there was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews .
43003002	This man came to Jesus by night and said to him , » Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher come from God ; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him . «
43003003	Jesus answered him , » Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God . «
43003004	Nicodemus said to him , » How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born ? «
43003005	Jesus answered , » Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter the kingdom of God .
43003006	That which is born of the flesh is flesh , and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Do not marvel that I said to you , ‘ You must be born again . ’
43003008	The wind blows where it wishes , and you hear the sound of it , but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit . «
43003009	Nicodemus said to him , » How can this be ? «
43003010	Jesus answered him , » Are you the teacher of Israel , and yet you do not understand these things ?
43003011	Truly , truly , I say to you , we speak of what we know , and testify to what we have seen ; but you do not receive our testimony .
43003012	If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has ascended into heaven , but he who came from heaven – the Son of Man .
43003014	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
43003015	that whoever believes in him may have eternal life .
43003016	For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through him might be saved .
43003018	He who believes in him is not condemned ; but he who does not believe is condemned already , because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God .
43003019	And this is the judgment , that the light has come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
43003020	For every one who does evil hates the light , and does not come to the light , lest his deeds should be exposed .
43003021	But he who does the truth comes to the light , that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been done in God . «
43003022	After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea , and there he remained with them and baptized .
43003023	Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because there was much water there ; and people came and were baptized .
43003024	For John had not yet been put in prison .
43003025	Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purifying .
43003026	And they came to John and said to him , » Rabbi , he who was with you beyond the Jordan , to whom you have testified — behold , he is baptizing , and all are going to him . «
43003027	John answered , » A man can receive only what is given to him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves bear me witness , that I said , ‘ I am not the Christ , ’ but I have been sent before him .
43003029	He who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice . Therefore this joy of mine is now full .
43003030	He must increase , but I must decrease .
43003031	» He who comes from above is above all ; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth , and of the earth he speaks . He who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	He testifies to what he has seen and heard ; yet no one receives his testimony .
43003033	He who has received his testimony has certified that God is true .
43003034	For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God gives the Spirit without measure .
43003035	The Father loves the Son , and has given all things into his hand .
43003036	He who believes in the Son has eternal life ; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God remains on him . «
43004001	Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
43004002	( although Jesus himself did not baptize , but only his disciples ) ,
43004003	he left Judea and departed again to Galilee .
43004004	Now he had to go through Samaria .
43004005	So he came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar , near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob's well was there , and Jesus , wearied as he was from his journey , sat down by the well . It was about the sixth hour .
43004007	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water . Jesus said to her , » Give me a drink . «
43004008	For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food .
43004009	Then the woman of Samaria said to him , » How is it that you , being a Jew , ask a drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? « For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans .
43004010	Jesus answered her , » If you knew the gift of God , and who it is that is saying to you , ‘ Give me a drink , ’ you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . «
43004011	The woman said to him , » Sir , you have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . Where do you get that living water ?
43004012	Are you greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank from it himself , as well as his sons and his cattle ? «
43004013	Jesus answered her , » Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again ,
43004014	but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst . The water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life . «
43004015	The woman said to him , » Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst , nor come here to draw . «
43004016	Jesus said to her , » Go , call your husband , and come here . «
43004017	The woman answered , » I have no husband . « Jesus said to her , » You are right in saying , ‘ I have no husband ’ ;
43004018	for you have had five husbands , and the one whom you now have is not your husband ; this you have said truly . «
43004019	The woman said to him , » Sir , I perceive that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship . «
43004021	Jesus said to her , » Woman , believe me , the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father .
43004022	You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we know , for salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But the hour is coming , and now is , when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for such the Father seeks to worship him .
43004024	God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . «
43004025	The woman said to him , » I know that Messiah is coming « ( who is called Christ ) . » When he comes , he will tell us all things . «
43004026	Jesus said to her , » I who speak to you am he . «
43004027	Just then his disciples came . And they marveled that he was talking with a woman , but no one said , » What do you wish ? « or , » Why are you talking with her ? «
43004028	Then the woman left her water jar , and went away into the city , and said to the people ,
43004029	» Come , see a man who told me all that I ever did . Could this be the Christ ? «
43004030	They went out of the city and came to him .
43004031	Meanwhile his disciples urged him , saying , » Rabbi , eat . «
43004032	But he said to them , » I have food to eat of which you do not know . «
43004033	So the disciples said to one another , » Has any one brought him food ? «
43004034	Jesus said to them , » My food is to do the will of him who sent me , and to finish his work .
43004035	Do you not say , ‘ There are yet four months and then comes the harvest ’ ? Behold , I tell you , lift up your eyes , and look at the fields ! They are already white for harvest .
43004036	And he who reaps receives wages , and gathers fruit for eternal life , so that sower and reaper may rejoice together .
43004037	For here the saying is true , ‘ One sows and another reaps . ’
43004038	I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored ; others have labored , and you have entered into their labor . «
43004039	Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony , » He told me all that I ever did . «
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to him , they urged him to stay with them ; and he stayed there two days .
43004041	And many more believed because of his word .
43004042	They said to the woman , » We no longer believe just because of what you said ; now we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this man is indeed the Savior of the world . «
43004043	After the two days he departed to Galilee .
43004044	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
43004045	So when he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him , having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast , for they too had gone to the feast .
43004046	So he came again to Cana in Galilee , where he had made the water wine . And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick .
43004047	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
43004048	Jesus said to him , » Unless you people see signs and wonders , you will never believe . «
43004049	The official said to him , » Sir , come down before my child dies . «
43004050	Jesus said to him , » Go ; your son will live . « The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way .
43004051	As he was going down , his servants met him and told him that his son was living .
43004052	So he inquired of them the hour when his son got better , and they said to him , » Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . «
43004053	So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said to him , » Your son will live . « And he himself believed , and all his household .
43004054	This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	After this there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool , which is called in Hebrew , Bethesda , having five porches .
43005003	In these lay a multitude of disabled people , blind , lame , paralyzed .
43005005	One man who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been in this condition for a long time , he said to him , » Do you want to be made well ? «
43005007	The sick man answered him , » Sir , I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up ; but while I am coming , another steps down before me . «
43005008	Jesus said to him , » Rise , take up your bed , and walk . «
43005009	And at once the man was healed , and he took up his bed and walked . Now that day was the Sabbath .
43005010	So the Jews said to the man who was cured , » It is the Sabbath ; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed . «
43005011	But he answered them , » The man who made me well said to me , ‘ Take up your bed , and walk . ’ «
43005012	They asked him , » Who is the man who said to you , ‘ Take up your bed , and walk ’ ? «
43005013	Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had withdrawn , as there was a crowd in that place .
43005014	Afterward , Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , » See , you are well . Sin no more , so that nothing worse may happen to you . «
43005015	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
43005016	For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus , because he was doing these things on the Sabbath .
43005017	But Jesus answered them , » My Father is working still , and I am working . «
43005018	Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sabbath , but also said that God was his Father , making himself equal with God .
43005019	Jesus said to them , » Truly , truly , I say to you , the Son can do nothing of himself , but only what he sees the Father doing ; for whatever he does , the Son also does .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does ; and he will show him greater works than these , that you may marvel .
43005021	For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them , even so the Son gives life to whom he will .
43005022	For the Father judges no one , but has given all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father . He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who hears my word and believes him who sent me , has eternal life ; and shall not come into judgment , but has passed from death to life .
43005025	Truly , truly , I say to you , the hour is coming , and now is , when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God ; and those who hear will live .
43005026	For as the Father has life in himself , so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself ,
43005027	and has given him authority to execute judgment , because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	Do not marvel at this ; for the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice
43005029	and come forth – those who have done good , to the resurrection of life , and those who have done evil , to the resurrection of judgment .
43005030	» I can do nothing of myself ; as I hear , I judge ; and my judgment is just , because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me .
43005031	» If I bear witness of myself , my testimony is not true .
43005032	There is another who bears witness of me , and I know that the testimony which he bears of me is true .
43005033	You have sent to John , and he has borne witness to the truth .
43005034	Not that the testimony which I receive is from man ; but I say this that you may be saved .
43005035	He was a burning and shining lamp , and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his light .
43005036	But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John ; for the works which the Father has given me to finish , these very works which I am doing , bear witness of me , that the Father has sent me .
43005037	And the Father who sent me has himself testified of me . You have never heard his voice , nor seen his form .
43005038	And you do not have his word abiding in you , for you do not believe him whom he has sent .
43005039	You search the Scriptures , because in them you think that you have eternal life ; and these are they that testify of me .
43005040	Yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life .
43005041	» I do not receive glory from men .
43005042	But I know you , that you do not have the love of God in you .
43005043	I have come in my Father's name , and you do not receive me ; if another comes in his own name , him you will receive .
43005044	How can you believe , who receive glory from one another , and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
43005045	Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father ; it is Moses who accuses you , on whom you set your hope .
43005046	If you believed Moses , you would believe me , for he wrote about me .
43005047	But if you do not believe his writings , how will you believe my words ? «
43006001	After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee , which is the Sea of Tiberias .
43006002	And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his signs which he performed on those who were diseased .
43006003	Jesus went up on the mountain , and there sat down with his disciples .
43006004	Now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was near .
43006005	Then Jesus lifted up his eyes , and seeing a great multitude coming toward him , he said to Philip , » Where shall we buy bread , that these people may eat ? «
43006006	But this he said to test him , for he himself knew what he would do .
43006007	Philip answered him , » Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each one of them to have a little . «
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , said to him ,
43006009	» There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish , but what are they among so many ? «
43006010	Jesus said , » Make the people sit down . « Now there was much grass in the place ; so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
43006011	Jesus then took the loaves , and when he had given thanks , he distributed them to those who were seated ; so also the fish , as much as they wanted .
43006012	And when they had eaten their fill , he said to his disciples , » Gather up the fragments left over , that nothing may be lost . «
43006013	So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , left over by those who had eaten .
43006014	When the people saw the sign that Jesus did , they said , » Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world . «
43006015	Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king , Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
43006016	When evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ,
43006017	got into a boat , and started across the sea to Capernaum . It was now dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
43006018	The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing .
43006019	So when they had rowed about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat ; and they were afraid .
43006020	But he said to them , » It is I ; do not be afraid . «
43006021	Then they were glad to take him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going .
43006022	On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there , and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples , but that his disciples had gone away alone .
43006023	However , boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	So when the people saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , they also got into the boats and went to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
43006025	When they found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , » Rabbi , when did you come here ? «
43006026	Jesus answered them , » Truly , truly , I say to you , you seek me , not because you saw the signs , but because you ate your fill of the loaves .
43006027	Do not labor for the food which perishes , but for the food which endures to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you ; for on him has God the Father set his seal . «
43006028	Then they said to him , » What must we do , to be doing the works of God ? «
43006029	Jesus answered them , » This is the work of God , that you believe in him whom he has sent . «
43006030	So they said to him , » What sign will you perform then , that we may see it and believe you ? What work will you do ?
43006031	Our fathers ate the manna in the desert ; as it is written , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ «
43006032	Jesus then said to them , » Truly , truly , I say to you , it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven ; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . «
43006034	Then they said to him , » Lord , give us this bread always . «
43006035	And Jesus said to them , » I am the bread of life . He who comes to me shall never hunger , and he who believes in me shall never thirst .
43006036	But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe .
43006037	All that the Father gives me will come to me , and the one who comes to me I will by no means cast out .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
43006039	And this is the will of him who sent me , that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me , but raise it up at the last day .
43006040	For this is the will of my Father , that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . «
43006041	The Jews then began to murmur about him , because he said , » I am the bread which came down from heaven . «
43006042	They said , » Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How does he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? «
43006043	Jesus answered them , » Do not murmur among yourselves .
43006044	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
43006045	It is written in the prophets , ‘ And they shall all be taught by God . ’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me .
43006046	Not that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God ; he has seen the Father .
43006047	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes has everlasting life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
43006050	This is the bread which comes down from heaven , that a man may eat of it and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread which came down from heaven . If anyone eats of this bread , he will live for ever ; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh . «
43006052	Then the Jews began to argue among themselves , saying , » How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? «
43006053	So Jesus said to them , » Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you have no life in you .
43006054	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is food indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
43006056	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me , and I in him .
43006057	As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so he who feeds on me will live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread which came down from heaven , not as your fathers ate the manna and died . He who eats this bread will live for ever . «
43006059	This he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum .
43006060	Many of his disciples , when they heard it , said , » This is a hard saying ; who can listen to it ? «
43006061	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples complained about this , he said to them , » Does this offend you ?
43006062	What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before ?
43006063	It is the Spirit who gives life ; the flesh profits nothing . The words that I have spoken to you are spirit , and they are life .
43006064	But there are some of you who do not believe . « For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who would betray him .
43006065	And he said , » This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father . «
43006066	From this time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him .
43006067	Then Jesus said to the twelve , » Do you also want to go away ? «
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , » Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
43006069	And we believe , and have come to know , that you are the Holy One of God . «
43006070	Jesus answered them , » Did I not choose you , the twelve , and one of you is a devil ? «
43006071	He spoke of Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , for it was he who was to betray him , though one of the twelve .
43007001	After this Jesus went about in Galilee ; he would not go about in Judea , because the Jews sought to kill him .
43007002	Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand .
43007003	So his brothers said to him , » Leave here and go to Judea , that your disciples may see the works you are doing .
43007004	For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly . If you do these things , show yourself to the world . «
43007005	For even his brothers did not believe in him .
43007006	Jesus said to them , » My time has not yet come , but your time is always ready .
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil .
43007008	You go up to the feast . I am not yet going up to this feast , for my time has not yet fully come . «
43007009	Having said this , he remained in Galilee .
43007010	But after his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but in secret .
43007011	The Jews were looking for him at the feast , and saying , » Where is he ? «
43007012	And there was much complaining among the people about him . Some said , » He is a good man « ; others said , » No , on the contrary , he deceives the people . «
43007013	However , no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews .
43007014	Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught .
43007015	And the Jews marveled , saying , » How did this man get such learning , having never studied ? «
43007016	Jesus answered them , » My teaching is not mine , but his who sent me .
43007017	If anyone is willing to do his will , he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority .
43007018	He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory ; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true , and in him there is no falsehood .
43007019	Did not Moses give you the law ? Yet none of you keeps the law . Why do you seek to kill me ? «
43007020	The people answered , » You have a demon . Who is seeking to kill you ? «
43007021	Jesus answered them , » I did one deed , and you all marvel .
43007022	Moses therefore gave you circumcision ( not that it is from Moses , but from the fathers ) , and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
43007023	If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision , so that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well ?
43007024	Do not judge by appearances , but judge with right judgment . «
43007025	Then some of the people of Jerusalem said , » Is not this the man whom they seek to kill ?
43007026	Here he is , speaking publicly , and they say nothing to him ! Can it be that the authorities really know that he is the Christ ?
43007027	But we know where this man is from ; when the Christ comes , no one will know where he is from . «
43007028	Then Jesus cried out , as he taught in the temple , » You know me , and you know where I am from ; and I have not come on my own , but he who sent me is true , and him you do not know .
43007029	But I know him , for I am from him , and he sent me . «
43007030	Then they sought to take him ; but no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
43007031	And many of the people believed in him , and they said , » When the Christ comes , will he do more signs than this man has done ? «
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him .
43007033	Then Jesus said to them , » I shall be with you a little while longer , and then I go to him who sent me .
43007034	You will seek me , and you will not find me ; where I am you cannot come . «
43007035	The Jews said to one another , » Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him ? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What does he mean when he said , ‘ You will seek me and you will not find me , ’ and , ‘ Where I am you cannot come ’ ? «
43007037	On the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , » If anyone thirsts , let him come to me and drink .
43007038	He who believes in me , as the Scripture has said , out of his heart will flow rivers of living water . «
43007039	Now this he said about the Spirit , whom those who believed in him were to receive ; for as yet the Spirit had not been given , because Jesus was not yet glorified .
43007040	When they heard these words , some of the people said , » Surely this is the prophet . «
43007041	Others said , » This is the Christ . « But some said , » Will the Christ come from Galilee ?
43007042	Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from David , and from Bethlehem , the town where David was ? «
43007043	So there was a division among the people because of him .
43007044	Some of them wanted to seize him , but no one laid hands on him .
43007045	The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees , who said to them , » Why did you not bring him ? «
43007046	The officers answered , » No man ever spoke like this man ! «
43007047	The Pharisees answered them , » Are you deceived , you also ?
43007048	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him ?
43007049	But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed . «
43007050	Nicodemus , who had gone to Jesus before , and who was one of them , said to them ,
43007051	» Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing ? «
43007052	They replied , » Are you from Galilee , too ? Search and look , and you will find that no prophet is to rise out of Galilee . «
43007053	Then each went to his own house .
43008001	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	Early in the morning he came again to the temple ; all the people came to him , and he sat down and taught them .
43008003	Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery . And when they had set her in the midst ,
43008004	they said to him , » Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
43008005	Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such . What do you say ? «
43008006	They said this to test him , that they might have something of which to accuse him . But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger .
43008007	And when they continued to ask him , he stood up and said to them , » Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her . «
43008008	And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground .
43008009	Then those who heard it went away one by one , beginning with the oldest even to the last , and Jesus was left alone , with the woman standing before him .
43008010	Jesus straightened up and said to her , » Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? «
43008011	She said , » No one , Lord . « And Jesus said , » Neither do I condemn you ; go , and sin no more . «
43008012	Again Jesus spoke to them , saying , » I am the light of the world . He who follows me will not walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . «
43008013	The Pharisees then said to him , » You are bearing witness of yourself ; your testimony is not true . «
43008014	Jesus answered , » Even if I bear witness of myself , my testimony is true , for I know where I came from and where I am going ; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going .
43008015	You judge according to the flesh ; I judge no one .
43008016	And yet if I do judge , my judgment is true , for I am not alone , but I am with the Father who sent me .
43008017	In your own law it is written that the testimony of two men is true .
43008018	I am One who bears witness of myself , and the Father who sent me bears witness of me . «
43008019	Then they said to him , » Where is your Father ? « Jesus answered , » You know neither me nor my Father ; if you knew me , you would know my Father also . «
43008020	These words he spoke in the treasury , as he taught in the temple ; but no one arrested him , because his hour had not yet come .
43008021	Then Jesus said to them again , » I am going away , and you will seek me , and will die in your sin . Where I go you cannot come . «
43008022	Then the Jews said , » Will he kill himself , since he says , ‘ Where I go you cannot come ’ ? «
43008023	He said to them , » You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ; I am not of this world .
43008024	Therefore I told to you that you would die in your sins ; for if you do not believe that I am he , you will die in your sins . «
43008025	They said to him , » Who are you ? « Jesus said to them , » Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning .
43008026	I have much to say about you and much to judge ; but he who sent me is true , and I declare to the world what I have heard from him . «
43008027	They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father .
43008028	So Jesus said , » When you have lifted up the Son of man , then you will know that I am he , and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just what the Father taught me .
43008029	And he who sent me is with me ; he has not left me alone , for I always do what is pleasing to him . «
43008030	As he spoke these words , many believed in him .
43008031	Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him , » If you continue in my word , you are truly my disciples .
43008032	And you will know the truth , and the truth will make you free . «
43008033	They answered him , » We are Abraham's descendants , and have never been in bondage to anyone . How can you say , ‘ You will be made free ’ ? «
43008034	Jesus answered them , » Truly , truly , I say to you , everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin .
43008035	And a slave does not continue in the house forever , but a son continues forever .
43008036	So if the Son makes you free , you will be free indeed .
43008037	I know that you are Abraham's descendants , yet you seek to kill me , because my word has no place in you .
43008038	I speak of what I have seen with my Father , and you do what you have heard from your Father . «
43008039	They answered him , » Abraham is our father . « Jesus said to them , » If you were Abraham's children , you would do the things Abraham did ,
43008040	but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God . This is not what Abraham did .
43008041	You do the deeds of your father . « They said to him , » We were not born of fornication ; we have one Father – God . «
43008042	Jesus said to them , » If God were your Father , you would love me , for I proceeded and came forth from God ; I have not come of my own accord , but he sent me .
43008043	Why do you not understand what I say ? It is because you are not able to hear my word .
43008044	You are of your father the devil , and you want to do your father's desires . He was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks according to his own nature , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
43008045	But because I tell the truth , you do not believe me .
43008046	Which of you convicts me of sin ? If I tell the truth , why do you not believe me ?
43008047	He who is of God hears the words of God ; the reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God . «
43008048	The Jews answered him , » Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon ? «
43008049	Jesus answered , » I do not have a demon ; but I honor my Father , and you dishonor me .
43008050	Yet I do not seek my own glory ; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge .
43008051	Truly , truly , I say to you , if anyone keeps my word he will never see death . «
43008052	The Jews said to him , » Now we know that you have a demon ! Abraham died , as did the prophets ; and you say , ‘ If anyone keeps my word , he will never taste death . ’
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and so did the prophets . Who do you claim to be ? «
43008054	Jesus answered , » If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . It is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say that he is your God .
43008055	But you have not known him ; I know him . If I said , I do not know him , I would be a liar like you ; but I do know him and keep his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day ; he saw it and was glad . «
43008057	The Jews then said to him , » You are not yet fifty years old , and have you seen Abraham ? «
43008058	Jesus said to them , » Truly , truly , I say to you , before Abraham was , I am . «
43008059	So they took up stones to throw at him ; but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple .
43009001	As he passed by , he saw a man blind from birth .
43009002	And his disciples asked him , » Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? «
43009003	Jesus answered , » Neither this man sinned nor his parents sinned . But that the works of God might be revealed in him ,
43009004	we must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . Night is coming , when no one can work .
43009005	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world . «
43009006	As he said this , he spat on the ground and made clay of the saliva , and anointed the man's eyes with the clay .
43009007	And he said to him , » Go , wash in the pool of Siloam « ( which means , Sent ) . So he went and washed , and came back seeing .
43009008	The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar , said , » Is not this the man who used to sit and beg ? «
43009009	Some said , » It is he . « Others said , » No , but he is like him . « He said , » I am the man . «
43009010	They said to him , » Then how were your eyes opened ? «
43009011	He answered and said , » A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me , ‘ Go to the pool of Siloam and wash . ’ So I went and washed , and I received sight . «
43009012	They said to him , » Where is he ? « He said , » I do not know . «
43009013	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind .
43009014	Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes .
43009015	Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight . He said to them , » He put clay on my eyes , and I washed , and I see . «
43009016	Some of the Pharisees said , » This man is not from God , for he does not keep the Sabbath . « But others said , » How can a man who is a sinner do such signs ? « And there was a division among them .
43009017	So they again said to the blind man , » What do you say about him , since he has opened your eyes ? « He said , » He is a prophet . «
43009018	The Jews did not believe that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight .
43009019	And they asked them , » Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How then does he now see ? «
43009020	His parents answered , » We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
43009021	but how he now sees we do not know , nor do we know who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is of age ; he will speak for himself . «
43009022	His parents said this because they feared the Jews , for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed that he was Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
43009023	Therefore his parents said , » He is of age ; ask him . «
43009024	So for the second time they called the man who had been blind , and said to him , » Give God the glory ; we know that this man is a sinner . «
43009025	He answered , » Whether he is a sinner or not , I do not know . One thing I know , that though I was blind , now I see . «
43009026	Then they said to him , » What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? «
43009027	He answered them , » I have told you already and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples , too ? «
43009028	Then they reviled him and said , » You are his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses , but as for this fellow , we do not know where he comes from . «
43009030	The man answered , » Why , this is a marvel ! You do not know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
43009031	We know that God does not listen to sinners , but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will , he listens to him .
43009032	Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind .
43009033	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . «
43009034	They answered him , » You were born in utter sin , and are you teaching us ? « And they cast him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out , and when he found him , he said , » Do you believe in the Son of Man ? «
43009036	He answered , » Who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? «
43009037	Jesus said to him , » You have seen him , and it is he who speaks with you . «
43009038	Then he said , » Lord , I believe ! « And he worshiped him .
43009039	Jesus said , » For judgment I have come into this world , that those who do not see may see , and that those who see may become blind . «
43009040	Then some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this , and said to him , » Are we blind also ? «
43009041	Jesus said to them , » If you were blind , you would have no guilt ; but now that you say , ‘ We see , ’ your sin remains .
43010001	» Truly , truly , I say to you , the man who does not enter the sheepfold by the door , but climbs in by some other way , he is a thief and a robber .
43010002	But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	To him the doorkeeper opens , and the sheep hear his voice ; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	When he has brought out all his own , he goes on before them , and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
43010005	A stranger they will not follow , but they will flee from him , for they do not know the voice of strangers . «
43010006	This figure Jesus used with them , but they did not understand what he was saying to them .
43010007	Then Jesus said to them again , » Truly , truly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
43010008	All who ever came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them .
43010009	I am the door . If anyone enters by me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy ; I have come that they may have life , and have it abundantly .
43010011	I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
43010012	But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd , who does not own the sheep , sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees ; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them .
43010013	He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep .
43010014	I am the good shepherd ; I know my sheep , and my sheep know me —
43010015	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father ; and I lay down my life for the sheep .
43010016	And I have other sheep that are not of this fold ; I must bring them also , and they will heed my voice . So there shall be one flock and one shepherd .
43010017	For this reason my Father loves me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again .
43010018	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of my own accord . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This command I have received from my Father . «
43010019	There was again a division among the Jews because of these words .
43010020	Many of them said , » He has a demon , and is mad . Why listen to him ? «
43010021	Others said , » These are not the sayings of one who has a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? «
43010022	Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
43010023	and Jesus was in the temple , walking in Solomon's Porch .
43010024	So the Jews gathered round him and said to him , » How long will you keep us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . «
43010025	Jesus answered them , » I told you , and you do not believe . The works that I do in my Father's name , they bear witness of me ;
43010026	but you do not believe , because you are not of my sheep .
43010027	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish ; no one shall snatch them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand .
43010030	I and the Father are one . «
43010031	The Jews took up stones again to stone him .
43010032	Jesus answered them , » I have shown you many good works from the Father . For which of these do you stone me ? «
43010033	The Jews answered him , » For a good work we do not stone you , but for blasphemy , and because you , being a man , make yourself God . «
43010034	Jesus answered them , » Is it not written in your law , ‘ I said , you are gods ’ ?
43010035	If he called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture cannot be broken ) ,
43010036	do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ because I said , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ?
43010037	If I do not do the works of my father , do not believe me ;
43010038	but if I do them , even though you do not believe me , believe the works , that you may know and understand that the Father is in me , and I am in the Father . «
43010039	Again they tried to seize him , but he escaped from their hands .
43010040	He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first , and there he stayed .
43010041	And many came to him and they said , » John performed no sign , but all that John said about this man was true . «
43010042	And many believed in him there .
43011001	Now a certain man was sick , Lazarus of Bethany , the village of Mary and her sister Martha .
43011002	It was this Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick .
43011003	So the sisters sent to him , saying , » Lord , he whom you love is sick . «
43011004	When Jesus heard it , he said , » This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified through it . «
43011005	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	So , when he heard that he was sick , he stayed two more days in the place where he was .
43011007	Then after this he said to the disciples , » Let us go to Judea again . «
43011008	The disciples said to him , » Rabbi , the Jews were just now seeking to stone you , and are you going there again ? «
43011009	Jesus answered , » Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	But if one walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . «
43011011	These things he said , and after that he said to them , » Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I go to wake him up . «
43011012	His disciples said , » Lord , if he sleeps , he will recover . «
43011013	Now Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep .
43011014	So then Jesus told them plainly , » Lazarus is dead ;
43011015	and for your sake I am glad that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him . «
43011016	Then Thomas , who is called the Twin , said to his fellow disciples , » Let us also go , that we may die with him . «
43011017	So when Jesus came , he found that he had already been in the tomb four days .
43011018	Bethany was near Jerusalem , about two miles off ,
43011019	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went and met him , but Mary sat in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , » Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	But even now I know that whatever you ask of God , God will give you . «
43011023	Jesus said to her , » Your brother will rise again . «
43011024	Martha said to him , » I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . «
43011025	Jesus said to her , » I am the resurrection and the life . He who believes in me , though he die , yet shall he live ;
43011026	and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die . Do you believe this ? «
43011027	She said to him , » Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , who is to come into the world . «
43011028	And when she had said this , she went her way and called Mary her sister , saying , » The Teacher is here and is calling for you . «
43011029	When she heard it , she rose quickly and went to him .
43011030	Now Jesus had not yet come to the village , but was still in the place where Martha had met him .
43011031	The Jews who were with her in the house , and comforting her , when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out , followed her , supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
43011032	Then Mary , when she came where Jesus was and saw him , fell at his feet , saying to him , » Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . «
43011033	When Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who came with her also weeping , he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled .
43011034	And he said , » Where have you laid him ? « They said to him , » Lord , come and see . «
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	Then the Jews said , » See how he loved him ! «
43011037	But some of them said , » Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying ? «
43011038	Then Jesus , deeply moved again , came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
43011039	Jesus said , » Take away the stone . « Martha , the sister of the dead man , said to him , » Lord , by this time there is a bad odor , for he has been dead four days . «
43011040	Jesus said to her , » Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God ? «
43011041	So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said , » Father , I thank you that you have heard me .
43011042	I knew that you always hear me , but I said this for the benefit of the people standing by , that they may believe that you sent me . «
43011043	When he had said this , he cried with a loud voice , » Lazarus , come out ! «
43011044	The dead man came out , his hands and feet bound with grave clothes , and his face wrapped with a cloth . Jesus said to them , » Unbind him , and let him go . «
43011045	Many of the Jews therefore , who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did , believed in him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , » What are we to do ? For this man performs many signs .
43011048	If we let him go on like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . «
43011049	But one of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , said to them , » You know nothing at all !
43011050	You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish . «
43011051	He did not say this on his own , but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation ,
43011052	and not for that nation only , but also that he would gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad .
43011053	So from that day on they plotted to put him to death .
43011054	Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews , but went from there to the country near the wilderness , to a town called Ephraim ; and there he stayed with his disciples .
43011055	Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand , and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
43011056	They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple , » What do you think ? That he will not come to the feast ? «
43011057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , so that they might arrest him .
43012001	Then , six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was , whom Jesus had raised from the dead .
43012002	There they made him a supper ; and Martha served , while Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him .
43012003	Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard , anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair . And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43012004	But one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , who was later to betray him , said ,
43012005	» Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor ? «
43012006	This he said , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief ; and as he had the money box , he used to take what was put into it .
43012007	Jesus said , » Let her alone , she has kept this for the day of my burial .
43012008	The poor you always have with you , but you do not always have me . «
43012009	Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death ,
43012011	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus .
43012012	The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
43012013	They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him , crying , » Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! The King of Israel ! «
43012014	Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it , as it is written ,
43012015	
43012016	His disciples did not understand this at first ; but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him .
43012017	The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness .
43012018	For this reason the people went to meet him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
43012019	The Pharisees then said to one another , » You see that you are accomplishing nothing . Look , The world has gone after him ! «
43012020	Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast .
43012021	Then they came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and said to him , » Sir , we wish to see Jesus . «
43012022	Philip went and told Andrew ; and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus answered them , » The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
43012024	Truly , truly , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it produces much fruit .
43012025	He who loves his life will lose it , and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life .
43012026	If anyone serves me , he must follow me ; and where I am , there my servant will be also . If anyone serves me , him my Father will honor .
43012027	» Now is my soul troubled , and what shall I say ? ‘ Father , save me from this hour ’ ? No , for this purpose I came to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify your name . « Then a voice came from heaven , » I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again . «
43012029	The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered . Others said , » An angel has spoken to him . «
43012030	Jesus answered , » This voice has come for your sake , not for mine .
43012031	Now is the judgment of this world ; now the ruler of this world will be cast out .
43012032	And I , when I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all men to myself . «
43012033	He said this to show by what death he was to die .
43012034	The crowd answered him , » We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever ; and how can you say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this Son of Man ? «
43012035	Then Jesus said to them , » A little while longer the light is with you . Walk while you have the light , lest the darkness overtake you ; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become sons of light . « When Jesus had said this , he departed and hid himself from them .
43012037	Though he had done so many signs before them , yet they did not believe in him ;
43012038	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spoke : » Lord , who has believed our report ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? «
43012039	Therefore they could not believe , because Isaiah said again :
43012040	
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him .
43012042	Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue ;
43012043	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
43012044	Then Jesus cried out and said , » He who believes in me , believes not in me but in him who sent me .
43012045	And he who sees me sees him who sent me .
43012046	I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in me should not remain in darkness .
43012047	If anyone hears my words and does not keep them , I do not judge him ; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world .
43012048	He who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge ; the word that I have spoken will condemn him on the last day .
43012049	For I have not spoken on my own authority ; but the Father who sent me gave me a command , what to say and what to speak .
43012050	And I know that his command is eternal life . Whatever I say , therefore , I say just as the Father has told me . «
43013001	Now before the feast of the Passover , when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
43013002	And during supper , when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon's son , to betray him ,
43013003	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he had come from God and was going to God ,
43013004	rose from supper , laid aside his garments , took a towel and girded himself .
43013005	After that , he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet , and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded .
43013006	Then he came to Simon Peter . And Peter said to him , » Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? «
43013007	Jesus answered him , » You do not realize now what I am doing , but later you will understand . «
43013008	Peter said to him , » You shall never wash my feet . « Jesus answered him , » If I do not wash you , you have no part with me . «
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , » Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head ! «
43013010	Jesus said to him , » He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet , but is completely clean ; and you are clean , but not every one of you . «
43013011	For he knew who was to betray him ; that was why he said , » You are not all clean . «
43013012	When he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , and returned to his place , he said to them , » Do you know what I have done to you ?
43013013	You call me Teacher and Lord , and you are right , for so I am .
43013014	If I then , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another's feet .
43013015	For I have given you an example , that you should do as I have done to you .
43013016	Truly , truly , I say to you , a servant is not greater than his master ; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him .
43013017	If you know these things , blessed are you if you do them .
43013018	I am not speaking of you all . I know whom I have chosen ; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ‘ he who ate my bread has lifted up his heel against me . ’
43013019	Now I tell you before it comes , that when it does take place , you may believe that I am he .
43013020	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who receives anyone I send receives me ; and he who receives me receives him who sent me . «
43013021	When Jesus had said this , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , » Truly , truly , I say to you , one of you will betray me . «
43013022	The disciples looked at one another , uncertain of whom he spoke .
43013023	One of his disciples , whom Jesus loved , was leaning close to the breast of Jesus .
43013024	Simon Peter motioned to him and said , » Ask who it is of whom he speaks . «
43013025	Then , leaning back on the breast of Jesus , he said to him , » Lord , who is it ? «
43013026	Jesus answered , » It is he to whom I shall give this piece of bread when I have dipped it . « And having dipped the bread , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
43013027	Then after the bread , Satan entered into him . Jesus said to him , » What you are going to do , do quickly . «
43013028	But no one at the table knew why he said this to him .
43013029	Some thought that , because Judas had the money box , Jesus was telling him , » Buy what we need for the feast « ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
43013030	Having received the piece of bread , he went out immediately . And it was night .
43013031	When he had gone out , Jesus said , » Now is the Son of Man glorified , and in him God is glorified .
43013032	If God is glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and glorify him at once .
43013033	Little children , I shall be with you a little while longer . You will seek me ; and as I said to the Jews , ‘ Where I am going , you cannot come , ’ so now I say to you .
43013034	A new commandment I give to you , that you love one another ; as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
43013035	By this all men will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . «
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , » Lord , where are you going ? « Jesus answered , » Where I am going you cannot follow me now ; but you shall follow afterward . «
43013037	Peter said to him , » Lord , why can I not follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you . «
43013038	Jesus answered , » Will you lay down your life for me ? Truly , truly , I say to you , the rooster will not crow , till you have denied me three times .
43014001	» Let not your hearts be troubled ; believe in God , believe also in me .
43014002	In my Father's house are many rooms ; if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
43014003	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and take you to myself , that where I am you may be also .
43014004	And you know the way where I am going . «
43014005	Thomas said to him , » Lord , we do not know where you are going , and how can we know the way ? «
43014006	Jesus said to him , » I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
43014007	If you had known me , you would have known my Father also ; and from now on you know him and have seen him . «
43014008	Philip said to him , » Lord , show us the Father , and that will be enough for us . «
43014009	Jesus said to him , » Have I been with you so long , and yet you do not know me , Philip ? He who has seen me has seen the Father ; how can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014010	Do you not believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority ; but the Father who dwells in me does his works .
43014011	Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me ; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves .
43014012	Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes in me will also do the works that I do ; and greater works than these will he do , because I go to the Father .
43014013	And whatever you ask in my name , I will do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	If you ask anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	» If you love me , you will keep my commandments .
43014016	And I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Counselor , to be with you forever –
43014017	the Spirit of truth , whom the world cannot receive , because it neither sees him nor knows him ; but you know him , for he dwells with you and will be in you .
43014018	I will not leave you orphans ; I will come to you .
43014019	A little while longer , and the world will see me no more , but you will see me . Because I live , you will live also .
43014020	In that day you will know that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
43014021	He who has my commandments and keeps them , it is he who loves me . And he who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and manifest myself to him . «
43014022	Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , » Lord , how is it that you will manifest yourself to us , and not to the world ? «
43014023	Jesus answered him , » If anyone loves me , he will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and make our home with him .
43014024	He who does not love me does not keep my words ; and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me .
43014025	» These things I have spoken to you , while I am still with you .
43014026	But the Counselor , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you .
43014027	Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives do I give to you . Let not your hearts be troubled , neither let them be afraid .
43014028	You have heard me say to you , ‘ I am going away and coming back to you . ’ If you loved me , you would rejoice because I said , ‘ I am going to the Father , ’ for the Father is greater than I .
43014029	And now I have told you before it takes place , so that when it does take place , you may believe .
43014030	I will no longer talk much with you , for the ruler of this world is coming , and he has nothing in me .
43014031	But I do as the Father commanded me , so that the world may know that I love the Father . Rise , let us go from here .
43015001	» I am the true vine , and my Father is the vinedresser .
43015002	Every branch in me that bears no fruit he takes away ; and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes , so that it may bear more fruit .
43015003	You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you .
43015004	Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself , unless it abides in the vine , neither can you , unless you abide in me .
43015005	I am the vine , you are the branches . He who abides in me , and I in him , he bears much fruit ; for apart from me you can do nothing .
43015006	If anyone does not abide in me , he is like a branch that is cast away and withers ; and the branches are gathered , thrown into the fire and burned .
43015007	If you abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask whatever you will , and it shall be done for you .
43015008	By this my Father is glorified , that you bear much fruit , and so prove to be my disciples .
43015009	As the Father has loved me , I also have loved you ; abide in my love .
43015010	If you keep my commandments , you will abide in my love , just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love .
43015011	» These things I have spoken to you , that my joy may be in you , and that your joy may be full .
43015012	This is my commandment , that you love one another as I have loved you .
43015013	Greater love has no one than this , that he lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	No longer do I call you servants , for a servant does not know what his master is doing ; but I have called you friends , for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you .
43015016	You did not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain , that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you .
43015017	This I command you , that you love one another .
43015018	» If the world hates you , know that it hated me before it hated you .
43015019	If you were of the world , the world would love its own . But because you are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
43015020	Remember the word that I said to you , ‘ A servant is not greater than his master . ’ If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . If they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
43015021	But all this they will do to you for my name's sake , because they do not know him who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	He who hates me hates my Father also .
43015024	If I had not done among them the works which no one else did , they would not have sin ; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father .
43015025	But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their law , ‘ They hated me without a cause . ’
43015026	» But when the Counselor comes , whom I shall send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father , he will testify of me .
43015027	And you also will bear witness , because you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	» I have said all this to you so that you will not go astray .
43016002	They will put you out of the synagogues ; yes , the time is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God .
43016003	And they will do these things because they have not known the Father , nor me .
43016004	But I have told you these things , that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you of them . » I did not say these things to you at the beginning , because I was with you .
43016005	But now I am going to him who sent me , yet none of you asks me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016006	But because I have said these things to you , sorrow has filled your heart .
43016007	Nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away . For if I do not go away , the Counselor will not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	And when he comes , he will convict the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
43016009	of sin , because they do not believe in me ;
43016010	of righteousness , because I go to the Father , and you see me no more ;
43016011	of judgment , because the ruler of this world is judged .
43016012	» I have many more things to say to you , but you cannot bear them now .
43016013	But when he , the Spirit of truth , comes , he will guide you into all truth ; for he will not speak on his own authority , but whatever he hears he will speak ; and he will tell you things to come .
43016014	He will glorify me , for he will take of what is mine and declare it to you .
43016015	All that the Father has is mine . Therefore I said that he will take of what is mine and declare it to you .
43016016	» A little while , and you will see me no more ; again a little while , and you will see me . «
43016017	Then some of his disciples said to one another , » What is this that he says to us , ‘ A little while , and you will not see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ’ ; and , ‘ because I go to the Father ’ ? «
43016018	They said , » What does he mean by ‘ a little while ’ ? We do not know what he is saying . «
43016019	Now Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him , so he said to them , » Are you asking yourselves about what I meant when I said , ‘ A little while , and you will not see me ; and again a little while , and you will see me ’ ?
43016020	Truly , truly , I say to you , you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice ; you will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will turn into joy .
43016021	When a woman is in labor she has sorrow , because her hour has come ; but as soon as she gives birth to the child , she no longer remembers the anguish , for joy that a child has been born into the world .
43016022	So you have sorrow now , but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy from you .
43016023	In that day you will ask me nothing . Truly , truly , I say to you , whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you .
43016024	Until now you have asked nothing in my name . Ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be full .
43016025	» I have said this to you in figurative language ; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures , but I will tell you plainly about the Father .
43016026	In that day you will ask in my name . And I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you ;
43016027	for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God .
43016028	I came from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I am leaving the world and going to the Father . «
43016029	His disciples said , » See , now you are speaking plainly , and not using a figure of speech !
43016030	Now we are sure that you know all things , and have no need for anyone to question you . By this we believe that you came from God . «
43016031	Jesus answered them , » Do you now believe ?
43016032	Indeed the hour is coming , yes , has now come , when you will be scattered , each to his own , and will leave me alone . And yet I am not alone , for the Father is with me .
43016033	I have said these things to you , that in me you may have peace . In the world you will have tribulation . But take courage ! I have overcome the world . «
43017001	When Jesus had spoken these words , he lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said : » Father , the hour has come . Glorify your Son , that your Son also may glorify you ,
43017002	as you have given him authority over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to all those you have given him .
43017003	And this is eternal life , that they may know you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom you have sent .
43017004	I have glorified you on the earth , having finished the work which you have given me to do .
43017005	And now , Father , glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made .
43017006	» I have manifested your name to the men whom you have given me out of the world . They were yours ; you gave them to me , and they have kept your word .
43017007	Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you .
43017008	For I have given them the words which you have given me , and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you ; and they have believed that you sent me .
43017009	I pray for them . I am not praying for the world , but for those whom you have given me , for they are yours .
43017010	And all mine are yours , and yours are mine , and I am glorified in them .
43017011	And now I am no longer in the world , but they are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them in your name – the name you gave me – that they may be one , even as we are one .
43017012	While I was with them , I kept them in your name – the name you gave me . I have guarded them , and none of them is lost except the son of perdition , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
43017013	But now I am coming to you , and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
43017014	I have given them your word ; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43017015	I do not pray that you should take them out of the world , but that you should keep them from the evil one .
43017016	They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43017017	Sanctify them by the truth ; your word is truth .
43017018	As you sent me into the world , I also have sent them into the world .
43017019	And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also may be sanctified in truth .
43017020	» I do not pray for these alone , but also for those who will believe in me through their word ;
43017021	that they all may be one , as you , Father , are in me , and I in you ; that they also may be in us , that the world may believe that you sent me .
43017022	And the glory which you gave me I have given them , that they may be one just as we are one :
43017023	I in them , and you in me ; that they may become perfectly one , and that the world may know that you have sent me , and have loved them even as you have loved me .
43017024	Father , I desire that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am , that they may behold my glory which you have given me , for you loved me before the foundation of the world .
43017025	O righteous Father , the world has not known you , but I have known you ; and these know that you sent me .
43017026	I have made known to them your name , and will make it known , that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them . «
43018001	When Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples over the Kidron valley , where there was a garden , which he and his disciples entered .
43018002	Now Judas , who betrayed him , also knew the place ; for Jesus often met there with his disciples .
43018003	So Judas , having received a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , came there with lanterns , torches , and weapons .
43018004	Then Jesus , knowing all that was to come upon him , went forward and said to them , » Whom do you seek ? «
43018005	They answered him , » Jesus of Nazareth . « Jesus said to them , » I am he . « And Judas , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
43018006	When he said to them , » I am he , « they drew back and fell to the ground .
43018007	Again he asked them , » Whom do you seek ? « And they said , » Jesus of Nazareth . «
43018008	Jesus answered , » I told you that I am he . So , if you seek me , let these men go . «
43018009	This happened so that the words which he had spoken would be fulfilled , » Of those whom you gave me I have lost none . «
43018010	Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it and struck the high priest’s servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant’s name was Malchus .
43018011	Jesus said to Peter , » Put your sword into its sheath ; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me ? «
43018012	Then the detachment of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him .
43018013	And they led him to Annas first ; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
43018014	Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
43018015	Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple . As this disciple was known to the high priest , he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest .
43018016	But Peter stood at the door outside . Then the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the girl who kept the door , and brought Peter in .
43018017	Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter , » You are not also one of this man’s disciples , are you ? « He said , » I am not . «
43018018	Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire , because it was cold , and they were standing and warming themselves . Peter also was with them , standing and warming himself .
43018019	The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered him , » I have spoken openly to the world . I always taught in synagogues and in the temple , where all the Jews come together , and I have said nothing in secret .
43018021	Why do you ask me ? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them . They know what I said . «
43018022	And when he had said this , one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand , saying , » Is that the way you answer the high priest ? «
43018023	Jesus answered him , » If I have spoken wrongly , bear witness to the wrong ; but if I have spoken rightly , why do you strike me ? «
43018024	Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	Now Simon Peter stood warming himself . Therefore they said to him , » You are not also one of his disciples , are you ? « He denied it and said , » I am not . «
43018026	One of the servants of the high priest , a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off , said , » Did I not see you in the garden with him ? «
43018027	Peter again denied it ; and at once a rooster crowed .
43018028	Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium , and it was early morning . But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves , so that they might not be defiled , but might eat the Passover .
43018029	So Pilate went out to them and said , » What accusation do you bring against this man ? «
43018030	They answered him , » If he were not an evildoer , we would not have handed him over to you . «
43018031	Pilate said to them , » Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law . « The Jews said to him , » It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death . «
43018032	This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would be fulfilled , showing by what death he was going to die .
43018033	Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again , called Jesus , and said to him , » Are you the King of the Jews ? «
43018034	Jesus answered , » Do you say this on your own , or did others say it to you about me ? «
43018035	Pilate answered , » Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me ; what have you done ? «
43018036	Jesus answered , » My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , my servants would fight , so that I should not be delivered to the Jews ; but now my kingship is not from here . «
43018037	Pilate said to him , » You are a king then ? « Jesus answered , » You say what I am — a king . For this I was born , and for this I have come into the world , to bear witness to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice . «
43018038	Pilate said to him , » What is truth ? « After he had said this , he went out to the Jews again , and told them , » I find no crime in him .
43018039	But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover . So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? «
43018040	Then they all cried again , » Not this man , but Barabbas ! « Now Barabbas was a robber .
43019001	So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him .
43019002	And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and they clothed him in a purple robe .
43019003	They came up to him , saying , » Hail , King of the Jews ! « and struck him with their hands .
43019004	Pilate went out again , and said to them , » See , I am bringing him out to you , that you may know that I find no crime in him . «
43019005	So Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , » Behold the man ! «
43019006	When the chief priests and officers saw him , they cried out , » Crucify him , crucify him ! « Pilate said to them , » You take him and crucify him , for I find no fault in him . «
43019007	The Jews answered him , » We have a law , and according to that law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . «
43019008	When Pilate heard these words , he was the more afraid ,
43019009	and he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus , » Where are you from ? « But Jesus gave him no answer .
43019010	Pilate said to him , » You will not speak to me ? Do you not know that I have power to release you , and power to crucify you ? «
43019011	Jesus answered , » You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above . Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin . «
43019012	From then on Pilate sought to release him , but the Jews cried out , » If you let this man go , you are not Caesar’s friend . Anyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar . «
43019013	When Pilate heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place that is called The Pavement , but in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
43019014	Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover , about the sixth hour . And he said to the Jews , » Behold your King ! «
43019015	But they cried out , » Away with him ! Away with him ! Crucify him ! « Pilate said to them , » Shall I crucify your King ? « The chief priests answered , » We have no King but Caesar . «
43019016	Then he handed him over to them to be crucified . So they took Jesus .
43019017	And he , bearing his cross , went out to a place called the Place of the Skull , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha .
43019018	There they crucified him , and two others with him , one on either side , and Jesus in the center .
43019019	Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross . It read : JESUS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
43019020	Many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , Greek , and Latin .
43019021	The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate , » Do not write , ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but , ‘ This man said , I am King of the Jews . ’ «
43019022	Pilate answered , » What I have written , I have written . «
43019023	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus , they took his garments , and made four parts , one for each soldier , and also his tunic . Now the tunic was without seam , woven in one piece from top to bottom .
43019024	So they said to one another , » Let us not tear it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be . « This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says : » They divided my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots . « This is what the soldiers did .
43019025	By the cross of Jesus stood his mother , and his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing by , he said to his mother , » Woman , behold your son ! «
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , » Behold , your mother ! « And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home .
43019028	After this , Jesus , knowing that all was now accomplished , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , said , » I thirst . «
43019029	Now a vessel full of wine vinegar was sitting there ; so they filled a sponge with the vinegar , put it on hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
43019030	So when Jesus had received the vinegar , he said , » It is finished ! « And he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
43019031	Therefore , because it was the day of Preparation , that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was a high day ) , the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
43019032	Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first , and of the other who had been crucified with him .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came out .
43019035	He who saw it has testified , and his testimony is true , and he knows that he tells the truth , that you also may believe .
43019036	For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled , » Not one of his bones shall be broken . «
43019037	And again another scripture says , » They shall look on him whom they have pierced . «
43019038	After this Joseph of Arimathea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly , for fear of the Jews , asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus , and Pilate gave him permission . So he came and took away his body .
43019039	And Nicodemus , who had at first come to Jesus by night , also came , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds .
43019040	So they took the body of Jesus , and bound it in strips of linen with the spices , as is the burial custom of the Jews .
43019041	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid .
43019042	So because of the Jewish day of Preparation , as the tomb was nearby , they laid Jesus there .
43020001	On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early , while it was still dark , and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb .
43020002	So she ran , and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one whom Jesus loved , and said to them , » They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid him . «
43020003	Peter therefore went out with the other disciple , and they were going toward the tomb .
43020004	They both ran , but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first .
43020005	And stooping to look in , he saw the linen cloths lying there , but he did not go in .
43020006	Then Simon Peter came , following him , and went into the tomb ; and he saw the linen cloths lying there ,
43020007	and the napkin that had been around his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but folded up in a place by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple , who reached the tomb first , also went in ; and he saw and believed .
43020009	For as yet they did not know the Scripture , that he must rise from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples went back to their homes .
43020011	But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb , and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb .
43020012	And she saw two angels in white , sitting where the body of Jesus had lain , one at the head and the other at the feet .
43020013	They said to her , » Woman , why are you weeping ? « She said to them , » Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid him . «
43020014	Saying this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not know that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , » Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? « Supposing him to be the gardener , she said to him , » Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have laid him , and I will take him away . «
43020016	Jesus said to her , » Mary ! « She turned and said to him in Hebrew , » Rabboni ! « ( which means , Teacher ) .
43020017	Jesus said to her , » Do not hold me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father ; but go to my brethren and say to them , » I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ’ «
43020018	Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples , » I have seen the Lord ! « And she told them that he had said these things to her .
43020019	On the evening of that day , the first day of the week , the doors being shut where the disciples were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood among them and said to them , » Peace be with you . «
43020020	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Jesus said to them again , » Peace be with you ! As the Father has sent me , I also send you . «
43020022	And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and said to them , » Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive the sins of any , they are forgiven them ; if you retain the sins of any , they are retained . «
43020024	Now Thomas , one of the twelve , called the Twin , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	So the other disciples told him , » We have seen the Lord . « But he said to them , » Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger in the mark of the nails , and put my hand in his side , I will not believe . «
43020026	Eight days later , his disciples were again in the house , and Thomas was with them . The doors were shut , but Jesus came and stood among them , and said , » Peace be with you ! «
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , » Put your finger here , and see my hands . Reach out your hand , and put it into my side ; do not be unbelieving , but believing . «
43020028	Thomas answered him , » My Lord and my God ! «
43020029	Jesus said to him , » Have you believed because you have seen me ? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed . «
43020030	Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book ;
43020031	but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing you may have life in his name .
43021001	After this Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias , and in this way he showed himself :
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas called the Twin , Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples were together .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , » I am going fishing . « They said to him , » We will go with you . « They went out and got into the boat ; but that night they caught nothing .
43021004	But early in the morning , Jesus stood on the shore ; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
43021005	Jesus said to them , » Children , have you any fish ? « They answered him , » No . «
43021006	He said to them , » Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some . « So they cast , and now they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish .
43021007	Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , » It is the Lord ! « Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he put on his outer garment ( for he had removed it ) , and threw himself into the sea .
43021008	But the other disciples came in the boat , dragging the net full of fish , for they were not far from land , but about a hundred yards off .
43021009	When they had come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , with fish lying on it , and bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , » Bring some of the fish you have just caught . «
43021011	Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore , full of large fish , one hundred and fifty-three ; and although there were so many , the net was not torn .
43021012	Jesus said to them , » Come and have breakfast . « Now none of the disciples dared ask him , » Who are you ? « They knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , and did the same with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead .
43021015	When they had finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , » Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? « He said to him , » Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you . « He said to him , » Feed my lambs . «
43021016	He said to him again a second time , » Simon , son of John , do you love me ? « He said to him , » Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you . « He said to him , » Tend my sheep . «
43021017	He said to him the third time , » Simon , son of John , do you love me ? « Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time , » Do you love me ? « And he said to him , » Lord , you know all things ; you know that I love you . « Jesus said to him , » Feed my sheep .
43021018	Truly , truly , I say to you , when you were younger , you girded yourself and walked where you wished ; but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go . «
43021019	This he said to show by what death he would glorify God . And after this he said to him , » Follow me . «
43021020	Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved , who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said , » Lord , who is the one who is going to betray you ? «
43021021	When Peter saw him , he said to Jesus , » Lord , what about this man ? «
43021022	Jesus said to him , » If I want him to remain until I come , what is that to you ? You follow me . «
43021023	Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would not die . Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die , but , » If I want him to remain until I come , what is that to you ? «
43021024	This is the disciple who testifies to these things , and who wrote these things ; and we know that his testimony is true .
43021025	But there are also many other things which Jesus did . If every one of them were to be written , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written .
44001001	In the first book , O Theophilus , I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach ,
44001002	until the day when he was taken up to heaven , after he had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen .
44001003	To these he also presented himself alive after his suffering , by many convincing proofs , appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God .
44001004	And while staying with them , he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem , but to wait for what the Father had promised , » Which , « he said , » you heard of from me ;
44001005	for John baptized with water , but before many days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . «
44001006	So when they had come together , they asked him , » Lord , are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel ? «
44001007	He said to them , » It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority .
44001008	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you ; and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and even to the ends of the earth . «
44001009	And after he had said this , as they were looking on , he was lifted up , and a cloud took him out of their sight .
44001010	And as they were gazing intently into the sky while he was going , behold , two men in white clothing stood beside them .
44001011	They also said , » Men of Galilee , why do you stand looking into the sky ? This Jesus , who has been taken up from you into heaven , will come in just the same way as you have watched him go into heaven . «
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day's journey away .
44001013	And when they had entered , they went up to the upper room , where they were staying ; Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James .
44001014	All these with one mind devoted themselves to prayer , along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
44001015	In those days Peter stood up among the brethren ( the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty ) , and said ,
44001016	» Brethren , the scripture had to be fulfilled , which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David , concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus .
44001017	For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry . «
44001018	( Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness ; and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out .
44001019	And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the field was called in their language Akeldama , that is , Field of Blood . )
44001020	For it is written in the book of Psalms , ‘ Let his homestead be made desolate , and let there be no one to dwell in it ’ ; and , ‘ let another man take his office . ’
44001021	Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
44001022	beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us — one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection . «
44001023	So they put forward two men , Joseph called Barsabbas ( who was also called Justus ) , and Matthias .
44001024	And they prayed and said , » You , Lord , who know the hearts of all men , show which one of these two you have chosen
44001025	to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside , to go to his own place . «
44001026	And they cast lots for them , and the lot fell to Matthias ; and he was added to the eleven apostles .
44002001	When the day of Pentecost had come , they were all together in one place .
44002002	And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind , and it filled the whole house where they were sitting .
44002003	And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves , and they rested on each one of them .
44002004	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .
44002005	Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem , devout men from every nation under heaven .
44002006	And at this sound the crowd came together , and they were bewildered , because each one heard them speaking in his own language .
44002007	They were amazed and wondered , saying , » Are not all these who are speaking Galileans ?
44002008	And how is it that we hear them , each of us in his own native language ?
44002009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites , and residents of Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene , and visitors from Rome , both Jews and proselytes ,
44002011	Cretans and Arabs — we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God . «
44002012	And they were all amazed and perplexed , saying to one another , » What does this mean ? «
44002013	But others were mocking and said , » They are full of sweet wine . «
44002014	But Peter , taking his stand with the eleven , raised his voice and addressed them : » Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem , let this be known to you and give heed to my words .
44002015	For these men are not drunk , as you suppose , since it is only the third hour of the day ;
44002016	but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel :
44002017	
44002018	
44002019	
44002020	
44002021	
44002022	» Men of Israel , listen to these words : Jesus of Nazareth , a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst , as you yourselves know —
44002023	this man , delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God , you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death .
44002024	But God raised him up , having loosed the agony of death , because it was impossible for him to be held in its power .
44002025	For David says concerning him , ‘ I saw the Lord always before me ; for he is at my right hand , so that I will not be shaken .
44002026	
44002027	
44002028	
44002029	» Brethren , I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
44002030	And so , because he was a prophet , and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne ,
44002031	he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ , that he was not abandoned to hades , nor did his flesh see decay .
44002032	This Jesus God raised up again , and of that we are all witnesses .
44002033	Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this which you see and hear .
44002034	For David did not ascend into heaven , but he says himself : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , » Sit at my right hand ,
44002035	
44002036	Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you crucified . «
44002037	Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles , » Brethren , what shall we do ? «
44002038	And Peter said to them , » Repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins ; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off , for all whom the Lord our God will call to himself . «
44002040	And he testified with many other words and exhorted them , saying , » Save yourselves from this perverse generation . «
44002041	So those who received his word were baptized , and there were added that day about three thousand souls .
44002042	They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship , to the breaking of bread and to prayer .
44002043	Everyone was filled with awe ; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles .
44002044	And all who believed were together and had all things in common ;
44002045	and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all , as anyone had need .
44002046	And day by day , attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes , they ate together with glad and sincere hearts ,
44002047	praising God and having favor with all the people . And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved .
44003001	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer , the ninth hour .
44003002	And a man lame from birth was being carried , whom they set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to beg alms of those who entered the temple .
44003003	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple , he asked for alms .
44003004	And Peter , along with John , directed his gaze at him , and said , » Look at us . «
44003005	And he gave them his attention , expecting to receive something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , » I do not have silver and gold , but I give you what I have ; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , walk . «
44003007	And taking him by the right hand , he raised him up ; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong .
44003008	With a leap he stood upright and began to walk ; and he entered the temple with them , walking and leaping and praising God .
44003009	And all the people saw him walking and praising God ,
44003010	and they recognized him as the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms , and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
44003011	While he clung to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon's , astounded .
44003012	And when Peter saw this he addressed the people , » Men of Israel , why do you wonder at this , or why do you stare at us , as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified his servant Jesus , the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate , when he had decided to release him .
44003014	But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you ,
44003015	but killed the Author of life , whom God raised from the dead . To this we are witnesses .
44003016	And his name , by faith in his name , has made this man strong whom you see and know ; and the faith which comes through Jesus has given him perfect health in the presence of you all .
44003017	And now , brethren , I know that you acted in ignorance , as did also your rulers .
44003018	But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets , that his Christ would suffer , he thus fulfilled .
44003019	Repent therefore , and turn again , so that your sins may be wiped out , that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord ,
44003020	and that he may send the Christ appointed for you , Jesus ,
44003021	whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago .
44003022	Moses said , ‘ The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren ; you shall listen to everything he tells you .
44003023	And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from among the people . ’
44003024	And likewise , all the prophets who have spoken , from Samuel and those who came afterwards , also announced these days .
44003025	You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers , saying to Abraham , ‘ And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed . ’
44003026	For you first , God raised up his servant and sent him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways . «
44004001	And as they were speaking to the people , the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them ,
44004002	being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44004003	And they seized them and put them in jail until the next day , for it was already evening .
44004004	But many of those who heard the message believed ; and the number of the men came to about five thousand .
44004005	On the next day , their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem ;
44004006	and Annas the high priest was there , and Caiaphas and John and Alexander , and all who were of the high-priestly family .
44004007	And when they had set them in the midst , they began to inquire , » By what power or by what name did you do this ? «
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , » Rulers of the people and elders ,
44004009	if we are being examined today for a good deed done to a cripple , as to how this man has been healed ,
44004010	be it known to you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead , by him this man stands before you healed .
44004011	He is the stone which was rejected by you , the builders , but which has become the chief cornerstone .
44004012	And there is salvation in no one else , for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved . «
44004013	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were uneducated , common men , they were astonished ; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus .
44004014	And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them , they had nothing to say in reply .
44004015	But when they had ordered them to leave the Council , they conferred with one another ,
44004016	saying , » What shall we do with these men ? For that a noteworthy miracle has been performed through them is apparent to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But in order that it may spread no further among the people , let us warn them to speak no longer to any one in this name . «
44004018	Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John answered them , » Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , you must judge ;
44004020	for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard . «
44004021	And when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people ; for all the people were praising God for what had happened .
44004022	For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old .
44004023	When they had been released , they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them .
44004024	And when they heard this , they lifted their voices to God together and said , » Sovereign Lord , it is you who made the heaven and the earth and the sea , and everything in them ,
44004025	who by the Holy Spirit , through the mouth of our father David your servant , said , ‘ Why did the gentiles rage , and the peoples plot futile things ?
44004026	
44004027	For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus , whom you anointed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel ,
44004028	to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place .
44004029	And now , Lord , look upon their threats , and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness ,
44004030	while you stretch out your hand to heal , and signs and wonders take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus . «
44004031	And when they had prayed , the place where they were gathered together was shaken ; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness .
44004032	Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul , and no one claimed that any of the things which he possessed was his own , but they had everything in common .
44004033	And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and great grace was upon them all .
44004034	For there was not a needy person among them , For all who were owners of land or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the sales
44004035	and laid it at the apostles' feet , and it was distributed to each as any had need .
44004036	Thus Joseph who was called by the apostles Barnabas ( which means , Son of Encouragement ) , a Levite , a native of Cyprus ,
44004037	sold a field which he owned , and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet .
44005001	But a man named Ananias , with his wife Sapphira , sold a piece of property ,
44005002	and with his wife's full knowledge he kept back some of the money for himself , and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles' feet .
44005003	But Peter said , » Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land ?
44005004	While it remained unsold , did it not remain your own ? And after it was sold , was it not at your disposal ? How is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart ? You have not lied to men but to God . «
44005005	When Ananias heard these words , he fell down and died . And great fear came upon all who heard of it .
44005006	The young men arose and wrapped him up , carried him out , and buried him .
44005007	After an interval of about three hours his wife came in , not knowing what had happened .
44005008	Peter said to her , » Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price . « And she said , » Yes , that was the price . «
44005009	Then Peter said to her , » How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Look , the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out . «
44005010	Immediately she fell down at his feet and died . When the young men came in they found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	And great fear came upon the whole church , and upon all who heard of these things .
44005012	Now many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles . And they were all together in Solomon's Porch .
44005013	None of the rest dared join them , but the people held them in high honor .
44005014	And all the more believers in the Lord , multitudes of men and women , were constantly added to their number ,
44005015	so that they even carried out the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and pallets , so that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them .
44005016	The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem , bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits , and they were all healed .
44005017	But the high priest rose up and all who were with him , that is , the party of the Sadducees , and they were filled with jealousy .
44005018	They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail .
44005019	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison , and brought them out , and said ,
44005020	» Go , stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life . «
44005021	And when they heard this , they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach . Now when the high priest and his associates came , they called the Council together , even all the Senate of the sons of Israel , and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought .
44005022	But when the officers came , they did not find them in the prison , and they returned and reported back ,
44005023	» We found the prison securely locked , and the guards standing at the doors ; but when we opened them , we found no one inside . «
44005024	Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words , they were much perplexed about them , wondering what would come of this .
44005025	And someone came and told them , » Look ! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people . «
44005026	Then the captain went along with the officers and brought them back without violence , for they were afraid of the people , that they might be stoned .
44005027	When they had brought them , they set them before the council . The high priest questioned them ,
44005028	saying , » We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name , and yet , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us . «
44005029	But Peter and the apostles answered , » We must obey God rather than men .
44005030	The God of our fathers raised Jesus — whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree .
44005031	God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior , to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel .
44005032	We are witnesses of these things , and so is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey him . «
44005033	When they heard this , they were furious and wanted to kill them .
44005034	But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel , a teacher of the law , held in honor by all the people , stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a while .
44005035	And he said to them , » Men of Israel , take care what you propose to do with these men .
44005036	For some time ago Theudas rose up , claiming to be somebody , and a group of about four hundred men joined him . But he was killed , and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing .
44005037	After this man , Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him ; he too perished , and all those who followed him were scattered .
44005038	So in the present case I tell you , keep away from these men and let them alone , for if this plan or action is of men , it will fail ;
44005039	but if it is of God , you will not be able to overthrow them ; or else you may even be found fighting against God . «
44005040	So they took his advice , and they called the apostles in and had them flogged . Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
44005041	Then they left the presence of the council , rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name .
44005042	And every day , in the temple and from house to house , they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ .
44006001	Now in those days when the number of disciples was increasing , the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the native Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food .
44006002	So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said , » It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables .
44006003	Therefore , brethren , pick out from among you seven men of good reputation , full of the Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint to this duty .
44006004	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word . «
44006005	And the statement pleased the whole congregation ; and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , and Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas and Nicolas , a proselyte from Antioch .
44006006	These they set before the apostles , and they prayed and laid their hands on them .
44006007	The word of God increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem , and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith .
44006008	And Stephen , full of grace and power , did great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen ( as it was called ) , and of the Cyrenians , and of the Alexandrians , and of those from Cilicia and Asia , arose and disputed with Stephen .
44006010	But they could not stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke .
44006011	Then they secretly induced men to say , » We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God . «
44006012	They stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes , and they came on him and seized him , and brought him before the council .
44006013	They put forward false witnesses who said , » This man never stops speaking against this holy place , and the law ;
44006014	for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which Moses handed down to us . «
44006015	And fixing their gaze on him , all who were sitting in the Council saw that his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	The high priest said , » Are these things so ? «
44007002	And he said : » Hear me , brethren and fathers ! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran ,
44007003	and said to him , ‘ Leave your country and your relatives , and go into the land that I will show you . ’
44007004	Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran . From there , after his father died , God had him move to this country in which you are now living .
44007005	But He gave him no inheritance in it , not even a foot of ground , and yet , even though he had no child , he promised that he would give it to him as a possession , and to his descendants after him .
44007006	But God spoke to this effect , that his descendants would be aliens in a foreign land , and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years .
44007007	‘ But I will judge the nation which they serve , ’ said God , ‘ and after that they will come out and worship me in this place . ’
44007008	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision . And so Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circumcised him on the eighth day ; and Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	» And the patriarchs , jealous of Joseph , sold him into Egypt . But God was with him ,
44007010	and rescued him from all his afflictions , and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household .
44007011	Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan , and great affliction , and our fathers could find no food .
44007012	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent our fathers there the first time .
44007013	At the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers , and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh .
44007014	Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to him , seventy-five persons in all .
44007015	And Jacob went down to Egypt , and there he and our fathers died .
44007016	They were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	» But as the time of the promise drew near , which God had granted to Abraham , the people increased and multiplied in Egypt
44007018	until there arose another king over Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph .
44007019	He dealt craftily with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants , so that they would not survive .
44007020	At this time Moses was born , and was beautiful before God . And he was brought up for three months in his father's house ;
44007021	and when he was placed outside , Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son .
44007022	Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and he was mighty in his words and deeds .
44007023	» When he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren , the sons of Israel .
44007024	And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly , he defended him and avenged the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian .
44007025	And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him , but they did not understand .
44007026	On the following day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting , and tried to reconcile them , saying , ‘ Men , you are brethren ; why do you wrong each other ? ’
44007027	But the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed him aside , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
44007028	Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? ’
44007029	At this remark Moses fled , and became an exile in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
44007030	» After forty years had passed , an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai , in the flame of a burning bush .
44007031	When Moses saw it , he was amazed at the sight ; and as he approached to look more closely , there came the voice of the Lord :
44007032	‘ I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob . ’ Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look .
44007033	And the Lord said to him , ‘ Take off the sandals from your feet , for the place where you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groaning , and I have come down to rescue them . Come now , and I will send you to Egypt . ’
44007035	This Moses whom they rejected , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ’ is the one God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them out , performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years .
44007037	This is the Moses who said to the Israelites , ‘ God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren . ’
44007038	This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai , and with our fathers ; and he received living oracles to pass on to us .
44007039	But our fathers refused to obey him . Instead , they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt ,
44007040	saying to Aaron , ‘ Make for us gods who will go before us ; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt — we do not know what has happened to him . ’
44007041	At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol , and were rejoicing in the works of their hands .
44007042	But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven , as it is written in the book of the prophets : ‘ Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices , forty years in the wilderness , O house of Israel ?
44007043	
44007044	» Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness , just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen .
44007045	And having received it in their turn , our fathers brought it in with Joshua when they took the land from the nations whom God drove out before our fathers . So it was until the time of David ,
44007046	who found favor in God's sight , and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But it was Solomon who built a house for him .
44007048	However , the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands ; as the prophet says :
44007049	
44007050	
44007051	» You stiff-necked people , uncircumcised in heart and ears , you always resist the Holy Spirit . You are doing just as your fathers did .
44007052	Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute ? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One , whom you have now betrayed and murdered ,
44007053	you who received the law as delivered by angels , and yet did not keep it . «
44007054	Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed their teeth at him .
44007055	But being full of the Holy Spirit , he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing at the right hand of God ;
44007056	and he said , » Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God . «
44007057	But they cried out with a loud voice , and covered their ears and rushed together upon him with .
44007058	Then they cast him out of the city and began to stone him ; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	And as they were stoning Stephen , he prayed , » Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . «
44007060	Then he fell on his knees and cried out with a loud voice , » Lord , do not hold this sin against them . « And when he had said this , he fell asleep .
44008001	Saul was consenting to his death . And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem , and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria , except the apostles .
44008002	Devout men buried Stephen , and made great lamentation over him .
44008003	But Saul began ravaging the church , and , entering house after house , he dragged off men and women and put them in prison .
44008004	Now those who had been scattered went about preaching the word .
44008005	Philip went down to a city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them .
44008006	The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
44008007	For unclean spirits , crying with a loud voice , came out of many who were possessed ; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed .
44008008	So there was much joy in that city .
44008009	Now there was a man named Simon , who had formerly practiced magic in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria . He boasted that he was someone great ,
44008010	and they all , from the least to the greatest , gave attention to him , saying , » This man is what is called the Great Power of God . «
44008011	And they gave heed to him , because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic .
44008012	But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
44008013	Even Simon himself believed , and after being baptized he continued with Philip . And seeing signs and great miracles performed , he was amazed .
44008014	Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent them Peter and John ,
44008015	who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	For he had not yet fallen upon any of them ; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then they laid their hands on them , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands , he offered them money ,
44008019	saying , » Give me also this power , so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit . «
44008020	But Peter said to him , » May your silver perish with you , because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money !
44008021	You have no part or share in this matter , for your heart is not right before God .
44008022	Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours , and pray to the Lord that , if possible , the intent of your heart may be forgiven you .
44008023	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity . «
44008024	And Simon answered , » Pray for me to the Lord , so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me . «
44008025	Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , they returned to Jerusalem , preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans .
44008026	But an angel of the Lord said to Philip , » Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . « This is a desert road .
44008027	So he got up and went . And there was an Ethiopian eunuch , a court official of Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was in charge of all her treasure ; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship ,
44008028	and he was returning and sitting in his chariot , and was reading the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	And the Spirit said to Philip , » Go up and join this chariot . «
44008030	So Philip ran up to him , and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet , and asked , » Do you understand what you are reading ? «
44008031	And he said , » How can I , unless someone guides me ? « And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him .
44008032	Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this : » He was led as a sheep to slaughter ; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent , so he does not open his mouth .
44008033	
44008034	And the eunuch said to Philip , » Please tell me , of whom does the prophet say this , about himself or about someone else ? «
44008035	Then Philip opened his mouth , and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus .
44008036	And as they went along the road they came to some water ; and the eunuch said , » Look , here is water ! What prevents me from being baptized ? «
44008038	And he commanded the chariot to stop , and they both went down into the water , Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
44008039	And when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away ; and the eunuch saw him no more , but went on his way rejoicing .
44008040	But Philip found himself at Azotus , and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea .
44009001	Now Saul , still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
44009002	and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus , so that if he found any belonging to the Way , both men and women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
44009003	Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus , and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him .
44009004	And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , » Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? «
44009005	And he said , » Who are you , Lord ? « And he said , » I am Jesus whom you are persecuting ,
44009006	but get up and enter the city , and it will be told you what you must do . «
44009007	The men who were traveling with him stood speechless , hearing the voice but seeing no one .
44009008	Saul got up from the ground ; and when his eyes were opened , he could see nothing ; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus .
44009009	And for three days he was without sight , and neither ate nor drank .
44009010	Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias ; and the Lord said to him in a vision , » Ananias . « And he said , » Here I am , Lord . «
44009011	And the Lord said to him , » Get up and go to the street called Straight , and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul , for he is praying ,
44009012	and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight . «
44009013	But Ananias answered , » Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much harm he has done to your saints at Jerusalem ;
44009014	and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name . «
44009015	But the Lord said to him , » Go , for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel ;
44009016	for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name . «
44009017	So Ananias departed and entered the house . And after laying his hands on him said , » Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus , who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming , has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit . «
44009018	And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales , and he regained his sight . And he got up and was baptized ,
44009019	and he took food and was strengthened . Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus .
44009020	And immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues , saying , » He is the Son of God . «
44009021	All those who heard him were amazed , and said , » Is this not he who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name , and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests ? «
44009022	But Saul increased all the more in strength , and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ .
44009023	When many days had passed , the Jews plotted to kill him ,
44009024	but their plot became known to Saul . They were watching the gates day and night , to kill him ;
44009025	but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	When he came to Jerusalem , he tried to join the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles . And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
44009028	And he was with them moving about freely in Jerusalem , speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord .
44009029	And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews ; but they were seeking to kill him .
44009030	But when the brethren learned of it , they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus .
44009031	So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace and was built up ; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit , it continued to increase .
44009032	Now as Peter went through all those regions , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
44009033	There he found a man named Aeneas , who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed .
44009034	Peter said to him , » Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you ; get up and make your bed . « Immediately he got up .
44009035	And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha ( which is translated Dorcas ) . She was full of good works and acts of charity .
44009037	And at that time she fell sick and died ; and when they had washed her , they laid her body in an upper room .
44009038	Since Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples , having heard that Peter was there , sent two men to him , imploring him , » Please come to us without delay . «
44009039	So Peter rose and went with them . And when he arrived , they took him to the upper room . All the widows stood beside him , weeping and showing the tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them .
44009040	But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed ; then turning to the body , he said , » Tabitha , arise . « And she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	And he gave her his hand and raised her up . Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive .
44009042	It became known all over Joppa , and many believed in the Lord .
44009043	And Peter stayed for many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon .
44010001	At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort ,
44010002	a devout man and one who feared God with all his household , and gave alms generously to the people and prayed to God continually .
44010003	About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him , » Cornelius ! «
44010004	And he stared at him in terror , and said , » What is it , Lord ? « And he said to him , » Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God .
44010005	Now send men to Joppa , and bring a man named Simon who is called Peter ;
44010006	he is staying with a tanner named Simon , whose house is by the sea . «
44010007	When the angel who spoke to him had left , he called two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants ,
44010008	and after he had explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	The next day , as they were on their journey and approaching the city , Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray .
44010010	And he became hungry and was desiring something to eat ; but while they were preparing it , he fell into a trance
44010011	and he saw heaven opened , and something descending , like a great sheet , let down by four corners to the earth .
44010012	In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the air .
44010013	A voice came to him , » Get up , Peter . Kill and eat ! «
44010014	But Peter said , » No , Lord ; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean . «
44010015	And the voice came to him again a second time , » What God has cleansed , you must not call common . «
44010016	This happened three times , and immediately the thing was taken up to heaven .
44010017	Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men that were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon's house , appeared at the gate .
44010018	They called out , asking whether Simon who was known as Peter was staying there .
44010019	While Peter was reflecting on the vision , the Spirit said to him , » Behold , three men are looking for you .
44010020	But get up , go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation , for I have sent them myself . «
44010021	Peter went down to the men and said , » Behold , I am the one you are looking for ; what is the reason you have come ? «
44010022	They said , » Cornelius , a centurion , a righteous and God-fearing man , who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation , was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house , and to hear what you have to say . «
44010023	So he invited them in to be his guests . The next day he rose and went off with them , and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	On the following day he entered Caesarea . Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends .
44010025	When Peter entered , Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him .
44010026	But Peter raised him up , saying , » Stand up ; I too am just a man . «
44010027	As he talked with him , he went in and found many people assembled .
44010028	And he said to them , » You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him ; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean .
44010029	So when I was sent for , I came without raising any objection . I ask then why you sent for me . «
44010030	Cornelius said , » Four days ago to this hour , I was praying in my house during the ninth hour ; and behold , a man stood before me in shining garments ,
44010031	and he said , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God .
44010032	Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter ; he is lodging in the house of Simon , a tanner , by the sea . ’
44010033	So I sent for you immediately , and you have been kind enough to come . Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God , to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord . «
44010034	And opening his mouth , Peter said : » I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality ,
44010035	but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him .
44010036	You know the word which he sent to Israel , preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ ( he is Lord of all ) .
44010037	You know what has happened throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached :
44010038	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power , and how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him .
44010039	We are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem . They put him to death by hanging him on a tree ;
44010040	but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen ,
44010041	not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
44010042	And he commanded us to preach to the people , and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	Of him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . «
44010044	While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the message .
44010045	All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed , because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles .
44010046	For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God . Then Peter said ,
44010047	» Can anyone refuse the water for these people to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have ? «
44010048	And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to stay on for a few days .
44011001	Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God .
44011002	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem , the circumcised believers criticized him ,
44011003	saying , » You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them . «
44011004	But Peter began and explained to them in order :
44011005	» I was in the city of Joppa praying ; and in a trance I saw a vision , something descending like a great sheet , let down from heaven by four corners ; and it came down to me .
44011006	And when I looked into it I saw four-footed animals of the earth , wild beasts , reptiles , and birds of the air .
44011007	Then I heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Get up , Peter . Kill and eat ! ’
44011008	But I said , ‘ No , Lord ; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth . ’
44011009	But the voice answered a second time from heaven , ‘ What God has cleansed you must not call common . ’
44011010	This happened three times , and all was drawn up again into heaven .
44011011	And behold , at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying , having been sent to me from Caesarea .
44011012	The Spirit told me to go with them with no hesitation . These six brethren also went with me , and we entered the man's house .
44011013	And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying , ‘ Send to Joppa and bring Simon , who is also called Peter ;
44011014	he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved , you and all your household . ’
44011015	As I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning .
44011016	And I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ‘ John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
44011017	So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us , who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I that I could oppose God ? «
44011018	When they heard this , they quieted down and glorified God , saying , » So then , God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance unto life . «
44011019	Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except Jews .
44011020	But there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also , preaching the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number believed and turned to the Lord .
44011022	News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem , and they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived and saw the grace of God , he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts ;
44011024	for he was a good man , full of the Holy Spirit and of faith . And a great number of people were brought to the Lord .
44011025	So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul ;
44011026	and when he had found him , he brought him to Antioch . So for a whole year they met with the church and taught great numbers of people ; and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch .
44011027	Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine all over the world . And this took place in the reign of Claudius .
44011029	And the disciples determined , each according to his ability , to send relief for the brethren living in Judea .
44011030	And this they did , sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to persecute them .
44012002	He had James the brother of John put to death with the sword .
44012003	When he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to arrest Peter also . This was during the days of Unleavened Bread .
44012004	When he had seized him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him , intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison , but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church .
44012006	The very night when Herod was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains , and sentries before the door were guarding the prison .
44012007	And behold , an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared , and a light shone in the cell ; and he struck Peter's side and woke him up , saying , » Get up quickly . « And the chains fell off his hands .
44012008	And the angel said to him , » Dress yourself and put on your sandals . « And he did so . And he said to him , » Wrap your cloak around you and follow me . «
44012009	So he went out and followed him ; and he did not know that what was done by the angel was real , but thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	When they had passed the first and the second guard , they came to the iron gate leading into the city . It opened for them by itself , and they went out and passed on through one street ; and immediately the angel left him .
44012011	When Peter came to himself , he said , » Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting . «
44012012	When he realized this , he went to the house of Mary , the mother of John who was also called Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
44012013	And when he knocked at the door of the gate , a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer .
44012014	When she recognized Peter's voice , in her joy she did not open the gate , but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate .
44012015	They said to her , » You are out of your mind ! « But she kept insisting that it was so . They said , » It is his angel . «
44012016	But Peter continued knocking ; and when they opened the door , they saw him and were amazed .
44012017	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent , he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . And he said , » Tell this to James and to the brethren . « Then he left and went to another place .
44012018	Now when day came , there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter .
44012019	When Herod had searched for him and could not find him , he examined the guards and ordered that they be put to death . Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while .
44012020	Now he was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon ; and they came to him in a body , and having persuaded Blastus , the king's chamberlain , they asked for peace , because their country depended on the king’s country for food .
44012021	On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes , took his seat upon the throne , and made an address to them .
44012022	And the people shouted , » The voice of a god and not of a man ! «
44012023	Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory , and he was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	But the word of God continued to grow and to be multiplied .
44012025	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission , taking along with them John , who was also called Mark .
44013001	Now in the church that was at Antioch there were prophets and teachers : Barnabas , Simeon who was called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
44013002	While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , » Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them . «
44013003	Then after they had fasted and prayed , they laid their hands on them and sent them off .
44013004	So , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	When they arrived at Salamis , they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews . And they had John as their helper .
44013006	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos , they came upon a certain magician , a Jewish false prophet , named Bar-Jesus ,
44013007	who was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , a man of intelligence . This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God .
44013008	But Elymas the magician ( for that is the meaning of his name ) was opposing them , seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith .
44013009	But Saul , who was also called Paul , filled with the Holy Spirit , looked intently at him
44013010	and said , » You who are full of all deceit and fraud , you son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness , will you not stop making crooked the straight ways of the Lord ?
44013011	Now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon you , and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time . « And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him , and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then the proconsul believed , when he saw what had happened , for he was amazed at the teaching of the Lord .
44013013	Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia ; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	But they passed on from Perga and came to Pisidian Antioch . And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	After the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , » Brethren , if you have any word of exhortation for the people , say it . «
44013016	Paul stood up , and motioning with his hand said , » Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen :
44013017	the God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt , and with uplifted arm he led them out of it .
44013018	For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness .
44013019	When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave them their land as an inheritance , for about four hundred and fifty years .
44013020	After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet .
44013021	Then they asked for a king , and God gave them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44013022	And after he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king ; concerning whom he testified and said , ‘ I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart , who will do all my will . ’
44013023	From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior , Jesus , as he promised .
44013024	Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	And as John was completing his course , he said , ‘ What do you suppose that I am ? I am not he . No , but after me one is coming , the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie . ’
44013026	» Brethren , sons of the family of Abraham , and those among you that fear God , to us has been sent the message of this salvation .
44013027	For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers , because they did not recognize him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled these by condemning him .
44013028	Though they found no ground for a death sentence , they asked Pilate to have him executed .
44013029	When they had carried out all that was written about him , they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from the dead ;
44013031	and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are now his witnesses to the people .
44013032	And we preach to you the good news that what God promised to the fathers ,
44013033	he has fulfilled for us , their children , by raising up Jesus . As it is also written in the second Psalm : ‘ You are my Son ; today I have begotten you . ’
44013034	As for the fact that he raised him from the dead , no more to return to decay , he spoke in this way : ‘ I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . ’
44013035	Therefore he also says in another Psalm , ‘ You will not let your Holy One see decay . ’
44013036	For David , after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation , fell asleep , and was laid with his fathers and saw decay ;
44013037	but he whom God raised did not see decay .
44013038	Therefore let it be known to you , brethren , that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you ,
44013039	and through him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses .
44013040	Therefore take care , so that what is said in the prophets may not come upon you :
44013041	
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas were going out , the people begged that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath .
44013043	When the meeting of the synagogue broke up , many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas , who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God .
44013044	The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord .
44013045	But when the Jews saw the crowds , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted what was spoken by Paul , and blasphemed .
44013046	Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said , » It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first . Since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life , behold , we turn to the Gentiles .
44013047	For so the Lord has commanded us : ‘ I have made you a light for the Gentiles , that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth . ’ «
44013048	When the Gentiles heard this , they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord ; and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
44013049	And the word of the Lord spread through the whole region .
44013050	But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city , and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and drove them out of their district .
44013051	So they shook off the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium .
44013052	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue , and so spoke that a great number believed , both of Jews and of Greeks .
44014002	But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren .
44014003	So they spent a long time there , speaking boldly for the Lord , who bore witness to the word of his grace , granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
44014004	But the people of the city were divided ; some sided with the Jews , and some with the apostles .
44014005	When an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers , to mistreat them and to stone them ,
44014006	they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia , Lystra and Derbe , and to the surrounding country ;
44014007	and there they continued to preach the gospel .
44014008	At Lystra there was a man sitting who had no strength in his feet , lame from birth , who had never walked .
44014009	He listened to Paul speaking ; and Paul , looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well ,
44014010	said with a loud voice , » Stand upright on your feet . « And he leaped up and began to walk .
44014011	And when the crowds saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the Lycaonian language , » The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! «
44014012	Barnabas they called Zeus , and Paul , because he was the chief speaker , they called Hermes .
44014013	The priest of Zeus , whose temple was just outside the city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates , and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds .
44014014	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it , they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd , crying out
44014015	» Men , why are you doing this ? We also are men , of like nature with you , and bring you good news , that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them .
44014016	In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways ;
44014017	yet he did not leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons , satisfying your hearts with food and gladness . «
44014018	Even with these words , they had difficulty keeping the crowds from offering sacrifice to them .
44014019	But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium ; and having won over the crowds , they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city , supposing that he was dead .
44014020	But after the disciples had gathered around him , he got up and entered the city . And the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe .
44014021	After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples , they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch ,
44014022	strengthening the souls of the disciples , encouraging them to continue in the faith , and saying , » Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God . «
44014023	And when they had appointed elders for them in every church , with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed .
44014024	They passed through Pisidia , and came into Pamphylia .
44014025	And when they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
44014026	From there they sailed to Antioch , where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed .
44014027	When they arrived , they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them , and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	And they spent a long time with the disciples .
44015001	But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brethren , » Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved . «
44015002	And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them , Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question .
44015003	So , being sent on their way by the church , they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , reporting the conversion of the Gentiles , and they gave great joy to all the brethren .
44015004	When they came to Jerusalem , they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders , and they reported all that God had done with them .
44015005	But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up , and said , » It is necessary to circumcise them , and to charge them to keep the Law of Moses . «
44015006	The apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter .
44015007	After there had been much debate , Peter stood up and said to them , » Brethren , you know that in the early days God made a choice among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe .
44015008	And God , who knows the heart , bore witness to them giving them the Holy Spirit , just as he also did to us ;
44015009	and he made no distinction between us and them , but cleansed their hearts by faith .
44015010	Now therefore why do you test God by putting upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear ?
44015011	But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , just as they are . «
44015012	All the assembly kept silent ; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles .
44015013	After they finished speaking , James replied , » Brethren , listen to me .
44015014	Simeon has related how God first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for his name .
44015015	With this the words of the Prophets agree , just as it is written ,
44015016	
44015017	
44015018	
44015019	Therefore it is my judgment that we should not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles ,
44015020	but that we should write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood .
44015021	For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him , since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath . «
44015022	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders , with the whole church , to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . They sent Judas called Barsabbas , and Silas , leading men among the brethren ,
44015023	and they sent the following letter with them : » The apostles and the brethren who are elders , to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles , greetings .
44015024	Since we have heard that some persons from us have disturbed you with words , unsettling your minds , although we gave them no instructions ,
44015025	it has seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44015026	men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	We have therefore sent Judas and Silas , who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth .
44015028	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials :
44015029	that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication . If you keep yourselves free from these , you will do well . Farewell . «
44015030	So when they were sent off , they went down to Antioch ; and having gathered the congregation together , they delivered the letter .
44015031	And when they read it , they rejoiced at its encouragement .
44015032	And Judas and Silas , who were themselves prophets , encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them .
44015033	And after they had spent some time there , they were sent off in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them .
44015035	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
44015036	After some days Paul said to Barnabas , » Let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord , and see how they are . «
44015037	Barnabas wanted to take John , also called Mark , with them .
44015038	But Paul kept insisting that they should not take along one who had deserted them in Pamphylia , and had not gone with them to the work .
44015039	There arose such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another , and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus .
44015040	But Paul chose Silas and left , being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord .
44015041	And he went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches .
44016001	And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra . A disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer ; but his father was a Greek ,
44016002	and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium .
44016003	Paul wanted this man to accompany him ; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places , for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
44016004	As they went on their way through the cities , they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem .
44016005	So the churches were strengthened in the faith , and increased in numbers daily .
44016006	And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
44016007	And when they came to Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them ;
44016008	so passing by Mysia , they went down to Troas .
44016009	A vision appeared to Paul in the night : a man of Macedonia was standing and begging him , and saying , » Come over to Macedonia and help us . «
44016010	When he had seen the vision , immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia , concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them .
44016011	So putting out to sea from Troas , we ran a straight course to Samothrace , and on the day following to Neapolis ;
44016012	and from there to Philippi , which is the leading city of the district of Macedonia , and a Roman colony . We stayed in this city some days ;
44016013	and on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer ; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had come together .
44016014	A woman named Lydia , from the city of Thyatira , a seller of purple fabrics , who was a worshiper of God , was listening . The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul .
44016015	When she and her household had been baptized , she urged us , saying , » If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house and stay . « And she prevailed upon us .
44016016	It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer , we were met by a slave-girl who had a spirit of divination . She brought her owners much profit by fortune-telling .
44016017	She followed Paul and the rest of us , crying , » These men are servants of the Most High God , who are telling you the way of salvation . «
44016018	She continued doing this for many days . But Paul was greatly annoyed , and turned and said to the spirit , » I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! « And it came out at that very moment .
44016019	But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone , they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities ,
44016020	and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said , » These men are Jews and they are throwing our city into an uproar .
44016021	They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice . «
44016022	The crowd joined against them , and the magistrates tore the garments off them and ordered them to be beaten with rods .
44016023	And when they had inflicted many blows upon them , they threw them into prison , charging the jailer to guard them securely .
44016024	Having received such a charge , he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks .
44016025	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them ,
44016026	and suddenly there came a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened .
44016027	When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open , he drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul cried with a loud voice , » Do not harm yourself , for we are all here ! «
44016029	And he called for lights and rushed in , and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas .
44016030	He brought them out and said , » Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? «
44016031	They said , » Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved , you and your household . «
44016032	They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house .
44016033	He took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds , and immediately he was baptized , he and all his family .
44016034	Then he brought them up into his house , and set food before them ; and he rejoiced with his whole household that he had believed in God .
44016035	But when it was day , the magistrates sent their police , saying , » Release those men . «
44016036	And the jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , » The chief magistrates have sent to release you . Therefore come out now and go in peace . «
44016037	But Paul said to them , » They have beaten us publicly , without trial , men who are Roman citizens , and have thrown us into prison ; and do they now cast us out secretly ? No ! Let them come themselves and take us out . «
44016038	The police reported these words to the magistrates , and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens .
44016039	So they came and apologized to them , and they took them out and asked them to leave the city .
44016040	They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia , and when they saw the brethren , they encouraged them and departed .
44017001	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a synagogue of the Jews .
44017002	And Paul went in , as was his custom , and for three weeks he reasoned with them from the scriptures ,
44017003	explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , » This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ . «
44017004	And some of them were persuaded , and joined Paul and Silas ; as did a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the leading women .
44017005	But the Jews were jealous , and taking some wicked men from the market place , they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar ; they attacked the house of Jason , seeking to bring them out to the people .
44017006	When they did not find them , they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities , shouting , » These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also ,
44017007	and Jason has welcomed them , and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus . «
44017008	The crowd and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this .
44017009	And when they had taken a pledge from Jason and the others , they let them go .
44017010	The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea , and when they arrived , they went into the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica , for they received the word with great eagerness , examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so .
44017012	Therefore many of them believed , along with a number of prominent Greek women and men .
44017013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea also , they came there too , agitating and stirring up the crowds .
44017014	Then the brethren immediately sent Paul out to go as far as the sea , but Silas and Timothy remained there .
44017015	Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens ; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible , they left .
44017016	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols .
44017017	So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks , and in the market place every day with those who happened to be there .
44017018	And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him . Some said , » What would this idle babbler wish to say ? « Others , » He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities , « — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , » May we know what this new teaching is which you present ?
44017020	For you are bringing some strange things to our ears ; so we want to know what these things mean . «
44017021	( Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new . )
44017022	So Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said : » Men of Athens , I see that in every way you are very religious .
44017023	For as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription , ‘ TO AN UNKNOWN GOD . ’ What therefore you worship as unknown , this I proclaim to you .
44017024	The God who made the world and everything in it , since he is Lord of heaven and earth , does not live in temples made by hands ;
44017025	nor is he served by human hands , as though he needed anything , since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything .
44017026	And he made from one man every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth , having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation ,
44017027	that they would seek God , if perhaps they might grope for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
44017028	
44017029	Being then God's offspring , we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone , an image formed by the art and imagination of man .
44017030	The times of ignorance God overlooked , but now he commands all people everywhere to repent ,
44017031	because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed , and of this he has given proof to all men by raising him from the dead . «
44017032	Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead , some of them sneered , but others said , » We want to hear you again on this subject . «
44017033	So Paul went out from among them .
44017034	But some men joined him and believed , among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them .
44018001	After this he left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	And he found a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus , having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome . He went to see them ,
44018003	and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them , and they worked , for by trade they were tentmakers .
44018004	And every Sabbath he was reasoning in the synagogue , and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks .
44018005	When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia , Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching , testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
44018006	But when they opposed him and blasphemed , he shook out his garments and said to them , » Your blood be on your own heads ! I am clean . From now on I will go to the Gentiles . «
44018007	Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus , a worshiper of God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord , together with all his household ; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized .
44018009	And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision , » Do not be afraid , but go on speaking and do not be silent ;
44018010	for I am with you , and no man will attack you to harm you , for I have many people in this city . «
44018011	And he stayed a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
44018012	But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the judgment seat ,
44018013	saying , » This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law . «
44018014	But when Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews , » If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime , O Jews , it would be reasonable for me to put up with you ;
44018015	but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law , see to it yourselves ; I refuse to be a judge of these things . «
44018016	And he drove them from the judgment seat .
44018017	And they all seized Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him in front of the judgment seat . But Gallio paid no attention to this .
44018018	After this Paul stayed many days longer , and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria , and with him were Priscilla and Aquila . In Cenchrea he had his hair cut , for he had taken a vow .
44018019	They came to Ephesus , and he left them there . Now he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews .
44018020	When they asked him to stay for a longer time , he declined ;
44018021	but on taking leave of them he said , » I will return to you if God wills , « and he set sail from Ephesus .
44018022	When he had landed at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the church , and then went down to Antioch .
44018023	After spending some time there , he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples .
44018024	Now a Jew named Apollos , a native of Alexandria , came to Ephesus . He was an eloquent man , well versed in the scriptures .
44018025	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in spirit , he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , though he knew only the baptism of John .
44018026	And he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue . But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
44018027	And when he wanted to go across to Achaia , the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him . When he had arrived , he greatly helped those who had believed through grace ,
44018028	for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public , proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ .
44019001	While Apollos was at Corinth , Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus . There he found some disciples .
44019002	And he said to them , » Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? « And they said , » No , we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . «
44019003	And he said , » Into what then were you baptized ? « They said , » Into John's baptism . «
44019004	Paul said , » John baptized with the baptism of repentance , telling the people to believe in the one who was coming after him , that is , in Jesus . «
44019005	On hearing this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them , the Holy Spirit came on them , and they spoke with tongues and prophesied .
44019007	There were about twelve men in all .
44019008	And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly , arguing and persuading about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when some were stubborn and disbelieved , speaking evil of the Way before the congregation , he withdrew from them , and took the disciples with him , reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This took place for two years , so that all who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord , both Jews and Greeks .
44019011	God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul ,
44019012	so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick , and diseases left them and the evil spirits went out .
44019013	But also some of the Jewish exorcists , who went from place to place , attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , » I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches . «
44019014	Seven sons of Sceva , a Jewish chief priest , were doing this .
44019015	But the evil spirit answered them , » Jesus I know , and I know about Paul , but who are you ? «
44019016	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , overpowered all of them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
44019017	This became known to all , both Jews and Greeks , who lived in Ephesus ; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified .
44019018	Many also of those who believed now came , confessing and disclosing their practices .
44019019	And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all ; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver .
44019020	So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed .
44019021	Now after these things were finished , Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , saying , » After I have been there , I must also see Rome . «
44019022	And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers , Timothy and Erastus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
44019023	About that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way .
44019024	For a man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought no little business to the craftsmen .
44019025	These he gathered together , with the workmen of similar trades , and said , » Men , you know that from this business we have our wealth .
44019026	And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus , but in almost all of Asia , this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people , saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all .
44019027	Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence . «
44019028	When they heard this , they were enraged and began crying out , » Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! «
44019029	The city was filled with the confusion , and they rushed with one accord into the theater , dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus , Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia .
44019030	Paul wanted to go in among the crowd , but the disciples would not let him .
44019031	Some of the Asiarchs also , who were friends of his , sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater .
44019032	Now some were shouting one thing , some another ; for the assembly was in confusion , and most of the people did not know why they had come together .
44019033	Some of the crowd prompted Alexander , since the Jews had put him forward . And Alexander motioned with his hand , wishing to make a defense to the people .
44019034	But when they recognized that he was a Jew , for about two hours they all with one voice shouted , » Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! «
44019035	And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd , he said , » Men of Ephesus , what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven ?
44019036	Therefore , since these facts are undeniable , you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash .
44019037	For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess .
44019038	If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone , the courts are open , and there are proconsuls ; let them bring charges against one another .
44019039	But if you want anything further , it shall be settled in the lawful assembly .
44019040	As it is , we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events . In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion , since there is no reason for it . «
44019041	After he had said this , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	After the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them , he set out for Macedonia .
44020002	When he had gone through those parts and had given them much encouragement , he came to Greece .
44020003	There he spent three months , and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he decided to return through Macedonia .
44020004	He was accompanied by Sopater of Berea , the son of Pyrrhus , and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians , and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy , and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia .
44020005	These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas .
44020006	But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread , and in five days came to them at Troas , where we stayed seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week , when we were gathered together to break bread , Paul began talking to them , intending to leave the next day , and he prolonged his message until midnight .
44020008	There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered .
44020009	And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window sill , sinking into a deep sleep . And as Paul talked on and on , he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third story and was picked up dead .
44020010	But Paul went down and fell on him , and after embracing him , he said , » Do not be alarmed , for his life is in him . «
44020011	When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten , he talked with them a long while until daybreak , and then left .
44020012	They took away the boy alive , and were greatly comforted .
44020013	But going ahead to the ship , we set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there ; for so he had arranged , intending himself to go by land .
44020014	And when he met us at Assos , we took him on board and came to Mitylene .
44020015	Sailing from there , we arrived the following day opposite Chios ; and the next day we crossed over to Samos ; and the day after that we came to Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus , so that he would not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem , if possible , on the day of Pentecost .
44020017	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church .
44020018	And when they came to him , he said to them : » You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you , from the first day that I set foot in Asia ,
44020019	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews ;
44020020	how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable , and teaching you publicly and from house to house ,
44020021	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ .
44020022	And now , behold , bound in the Spirit , I am going to Jerusalem , not knowing what will happen to me there ,
44020023	except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions await me .
44020024	But I do not consider my life of any account nor as precious to myself , if only I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to testify to the gospel of the grace of God .
44020025	And now , behold , I know that all of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face no more .
44020026	Therefore , I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men .
44020027	For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God .
44020028	Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock , among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with the blood of his Own .
44020029	I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you , not sparing the flock ;
44020030	and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
44020031	Therefore be alert , remembering that for three years I did not cease night and day to admonish each one with tears .
44020032	And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace , which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified .
44020033	I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes .
44020034	You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me .
44020035	In everything I did , I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak , remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said : ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ «
44020036	When he had said this , he knelt down and prayed with them all .
44020037	And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him ,
44020038	grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken , that they would not see his face again . And they accompanied him to the ship .
44021001	When we had parted from them and set sail , we came by a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia , we went aboard and set sail .
44021003	When we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria , and landed at Tyre ; for there the ship was to unload its cargo .
44021004	And having sought out the disciples , we stayed there for seven days . Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem .
44021005	And when our days there were ended , we left and started on our journey , while they all , with wives and children , brought us on our way until we were out of the city . After kneeling down on the beach and praying , we said farewell to one another .
44021006	Then we went on board the ship , and they returned home .
44021007	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre , we arrived at Ptolemais ; and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for a day .
44021008	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea , and entering the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , we stayed with him .
44021009	He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied .
44021010	As we were staying there for some days , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	And coming to us , he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands , and said , » This is what the Holy Spirit says , ‘ In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ’ «
44021012	When we heard this , we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul answered , » What are you doing , weeping and breaking my heart ? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . «
44021014	And when he would not be persuaded , we ceased and said , » The will of the Lord be done . «
44021015	After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us , bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus , an early disciple , with whom we were to lodge .
44021017	When we arrived at Jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
44021018	And the following day Paul went in with us to James , and all the elders were present .
44021019	After he had greeted them , he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44021020	And when they heard it , they glorified God . And they said to him , » You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed ; they are all zealous for the law ,
44021021	and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs .
44021022	What then is to be done ? They will certainly hear that you have come .
44021023	Therefore do what we tell you . We have four men who are under a vow ;
44021024	take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses , so that they may shave their heads . Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you , but that you yourself live in observance of the law .
44021025	But as for the Gentiles who have believed , we wrote to them our decision that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication . «
44021026	The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them . Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each one of them .
44021027	When the seven days were almost over , the Jews from Asia , upon seeing him in the temple , stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him ,
44021028	crying out , » Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place ; and besides he also brought Greeks into the temple , and he has defiled this holy place . «
44021029	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
44021030	Then all the city was aroused , and the people rushed together , and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple , and immediately the gates were shut .
44021031	While they were trying to kill him , a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion .
44021032	At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them ; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the commander came up and arrested him , and ordered him to be bound with two chains . He inquired who he was and what he had done .
44021034	Some in the crowd shouted one thing , and some another ; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar , he ordered him to be brought into the barracks .
44021035	When he came to the steps , he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob ;
44021036	for the mob of the people followed , shouting , » Away with him ! «
44021037	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he said to the commander , » May I say something to you ? « And he said , » Do you know Greek ?
44021038	Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness ? «
44021039	Paul replied , » I am a Jew , from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no insignificant city ; I beg you , let me speak to the people . «
44021040	When he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the steps , motioned to the people with his hand ; and when there was a great hush , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying ,
44022001	» Brethren and fathers , hear my defense which I now offer to you . «
44022002	And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew language , they became more quiet . And he said :
44022003	» I am a Jew , born in Tarsus of Cilicia , but brought up in this city , educated under Gamaliel , strictly according to the law of our fathers , being zealous for God just as you all are today .
44022004	I persecuted this Way to the death , binding and delivering into prison both men and women ,
44022005	as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify . From them I also received letters to the brethren , and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished .
44022006	» As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus , about noon a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me .
44022007	And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? ’
44022008	And I answered , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And he said to me , ‘ I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you are persecuting . ’
44022009	And those who were with me saw the light , but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me .
44022010	And I said , ‘ What shall I do , Lord ? ’ And the Lord said to me , ‘ Get up and go on into Damascus , and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do . ’
44022011	But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light , I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus .
44022012	» A certain Ananias , a devout man according to the Law , and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there ,
44022013	came to me , and standing near said to me , ‘ Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ’ And at that very time I looked up at him .
44022014	Then he said , ‘ The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth .
44022015	For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	Now why do you delay ? Get up and be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on his name . ’
44022017	» When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple , I fell into a trance
44022018	and saw him saying to me , ‘ Make haste , and get out of Jerusalem quickly , because they will not accept your testimony about me . ’
44022019	And I said , ‘ Lord , they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you .
44022020	When the blood of Stephen your witness was shed , I also was standing by and approving , and keeping the garments of those who were killing him . ’
44022021	And he said to me , ‘ Go ; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles . ’ «
44022022	Up to this word they listened to him , and then they raised their voices and said , » Away with such a fellow from the earth ! For he ought not to live . «
44022023	And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air ,
44022024	the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks , and commanded him to be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way .
44022025	But when they stretched him out with thongs , Paul said to the centurion who was standing by , » Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned ? «
44022026	When the centurion heard this , he went to the commander and told him , saying , » What are you about to do ? For this man is a Roman citizen . «
44022027	So the commander came and said to him , » Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? « And he said , » Yes . «
44022028	The commander answered , » I bought this citizenship for a large sum . « Paul said , » But I was born a citizen . «
44022029	So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately ; and the commander also was afraid when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains .
44022030	But on the next day , wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews , he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble , and brought Paul down and set him before them .
44023001	And Paul , looking intently at the council , said , » Brethren , I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day . «
44023002	The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , » God shall strike you , you whitewashed wall ! Do you sit to judge me according to the law , and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck ? «
44023004	Those who stood by said , » Would you revile God's high priest ? «
44023005	And Paul said , » I did not know , brethren , that he was the high priest ; for it is written , ‘ You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people . ’ «
44023006	But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , » Brethren , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees ; with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial . «
44023007	When he said this , a dissension broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , nor an angel , nor a spirit , but the Pharisees acknowledge them all .
44023009	There occurred a great uproar ; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and began to argue heatedly , saying , » We find nothing wrong with this man . What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him ? «
44023010	The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force , and bring him into the barracks .
44023011	The following night the Lord stood by him and said , » Take courage , for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem , so you must bear witness also at Rome . «
44023012	When it was day , the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty who formed this plot .
44023014	They went to the chief priests and the elders and said , » We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	You therefore , along with the council , give notice now to the commander to bring him down to you , as though you were going to determine his case more exactly . And we are ready to kill him before he comes near . «
44023016	But the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush , and he went and entered the barracks and told Paul .
44023017	Paul called one of the centurions and said , » Take this young man to the commander ; for he has something to tell him . «
44023018	So he took him and brought him to the commander and said , » Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you , since he has something to tell you . «
44023019	The commander took him by the hand , and going aside asked him privately , » What is it that you have to tell me ? «
44023020	And he said , » The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council , as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him .
44023021	But do not yield to them ; for more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him , having bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him ; and now they are ready , waiting for the promise from you . «
44023022	So the commander dismissed the young man , instructing him , » Tell no one that you have informed me of this . «
44023023	Then he called two of the centurions and said , » At the third hour of the night get ready two hundred soldiers with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea .
44023024	Also provide mounts for Paul to ride , and bring him safely to Felix the governor . «
44023025	And he wrote a letter having this form :
44023026	» Claudius Lysias , to His Excellency , Governor Felix : greetings .
44023027	This man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman citizen .
44023028	And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him , I brought him down to their council .
44023029	I found that he was accused over questions about their Law , but there was no accusation against him deserving death or imprisonment .
44023030	And when I was informed that there would be a plot against the man , I sent him to you at once , also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you . «
44023031	So the soldiers , in accordance with their orders , took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	But the next day , leaving the horsemen to go on with him , they returned to the barracks .
44023033	When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , they also presented Paul to him .
44023034	When he had read the letter , he asked from what province he was , and when he learned that he was from Cilicia ,
44023035	he said , » I will hear you when your accusers arrive also . « And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium .
44024001	After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders , with an attorney named Tertullus , and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor .
44024002	And when Paul was called , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying to Felix : » Since through you we have enjoyed much peace , and since by your provision , reforms are introduced on behalf of this nation ,
44024003	we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere , most excellent Felix , with all gratitude .
44024004	But , that I may not weary you further , I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly .
44024005	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
44024006	He even tried to desecrate the temple ; so we seized him .
44024008	By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges of which we accuse him . «
44024009	The Jews also joined in the attack , asserting that these things were so .
44024010	When the governor had motioned for him to speak , Paul replied : » Realizing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation , I cheerfully make my defense .
44024011	Since you can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship .
44024012	They did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd , either in the temple or in the synagogues , or in the city .
44024013	Neither can they prove to you the charges they are now making against me .
44024014	But this I admit to you , that according to the Way which they call a sect I do worship the God of our fathers , believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets ,
44024015	having a hope in God , which these men cherish themselves , that there will certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked .
44024016	And so I do my best always to have a clear conscience before God and men .
44024017	Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings .
44024018	As I was doing this , they found me purified in the temple , without any crowd or uproar . But there were some Jews from Asia —
44024019	who ought to be here before you and to make accusation , if they should have anything against me .
44024020	Or else let these men themselves tell what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Council ,
44024021	except this one thing which I shouted out while standing among them , ‘ With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today . ’ «
44024022	But Felix , having a more exact knowledge about the Way , put them off , saying , » When Lysias the commander comes down , I will decide your case . «
44024023	Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody but have some freedom , and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to his needs .
44024024	But some days later Felix came with Drusilla , his wife who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	But as he was discussing righteousness , self-control and the judgment to come , Felix became frightened and said , » Go away for the present , and when I find time I will summon you . «
44024026	At the same time , he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul . So he sent for him often and conversed with him .
44024027	But when two years had passed , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus , and desiring to do the Jews a favor , Felix left Paul in prison .
44025001	Festus then , three days after arriving in the province , went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews brought charges against Paul ; and they urged him ,
44025003	as a favor to them , to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem , for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way .
44025004	Festus answered that Paul was being kept at Caesarea , and that he himself intended to go there shortly .
44025005	» Therefore , « he said , » let the men of authority among you go there with me , and if there is anything wrong about the man , let them prosecute him . «
44025006	After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them , he went down to Caesarea , and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought .
44025007	And when Paul arrived , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing many serious charges against him , which they could not prove .
44025008	Paul said in his defense , » Neither against the law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar have I offended at all . «
44025009	But Festus , wishing to do the Jews a favor , said to Paul , » Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges ? «
44025010	But Paul said , » I am standing before Caesar's tribunal , where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you also very well know .
44025011	If , then , I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death , I do not refuse to die ; but if none of the charges brought against me is true , no one can hand me over to them . I appeal to Caesar . «
44025012	Then when Festus had conferred with his council , he answered , » You have appealed to Caesar , to Caesar you shall go . «
44025013	Now when a few days had passed , King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus .
44025014	While they were spending many days there , Festus laid Paul's case before the king , saying , » There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix ;
44025015	and when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him , asking for sentence against him .
44025016	I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges .
44025017	When therefore they came together here , I did not delay , but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in .
44025018	When the accusers stood up , they did not charge him of such crimes as I had expected ,
44025019	but they simply had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man , Jesus , whom Paul asserted to be alive .
44025020	Being at a loss how to investigate such matters , I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters .
44025021	But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision , I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar .
44025022	Then Agrippa said to Festus , » I also would like to hear the man myself . « » Tomorrow , « he said , » you shall hear him . «
44025023	So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the prominent men of the city . At the command of Festus , Paul was brought in .
44025024	Festus said , » King Agrippa and all who are present with us , you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me , both at Jerusalem and here , shouting that he ought not to live any longer .
44025025	But I found that he had done nothing deserving of death ; and as he himself appealed to the emperor , I decided to send him .
44025026	But I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord . Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you , King Agrippa , so that after the investigation has taken place , I may have something to write .
44025027	For it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to indicate the charges against him . «
44026001	Agrippa said to Paul , » You have permission to speak for yourself . « Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense :
44026002	» I consider myself fortunate that it is before you , King Agrippa , I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews ,
44026003	because you are especially familiar with all customs and controversies of the Jews ; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently .
44026004	So then , all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth up , which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem .
44026005	They have known about me for a long time , if they are willing to testify , that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion .
44026006	And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers ;
44026007	the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain , as they earnestly serve God night and day . And for this hope , O King , I am being accused by Jews .
44026008	Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead ?
44026009	I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	And that is just what I did in Jerusalem ; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison , by authority from the chief priests , but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them .
44026011	And as I punished them often in all the synagogues , I tried to force them to blaspheme ; and being furiously enraged against them , I persecuted them even to foreign cities .
44026012	» On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests .
44026013	At midday , O King , I saw on the way a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who journeyed with me .
44026014	And when we had all fallen to the ground , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ‘ Saul , Saul , why do you persecute me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goads . ’
44026015	And I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And the Lord said , ‘ I am Jesus whom you are persecuting .
44026016	But get up and stand on your feet ; for this purpose I have appeared to you , to appoint you a minister and a witness to the things which you have seen of me , and also to the things in which I will appear to you ;
44026017	rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles , to whom I am sending you ,
44026018	to open their eyes , so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me . ’
44026019	» So , King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
44026020	but declared first to those at Damascus , then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance .
44026021	For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me .
44026022	To this day I have had the help that comes from God , and so I stand here testifying both to small and great , saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen :
44026023	that the Christ must suffer , and that , by being the first to rise from the dead , he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles . «
44026024	And as he was saying this in his defense , Festus said in a loud voice , » Paul , you are out of your mind ! Your great learning is driving you mad . «
44026025	But Paul said , » I am not mad , most excellent Festus , but I am speaking the sober truth .
44026026	For the king knows about these things , and to him I speak freely ; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice , for this was not done in a corner .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you do . «
44026028	And Agrippa said to Paul , » In a short time you think to persuade me to become a Christian ! «
44026029	And Paul said , » Whether in a short or a long time , I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am — except for these chains . «
44026030	The king rose and the governor and Bernice , and those who were sitting with them ,
44026031	and when they had gone aside , they began talking to one another , saying , » This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment . «
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , » This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . «
44027001	When it was decided that we would sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius .
44027002	And embarking in a ship from Adramyttium , which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia , we put out to sea , accompanied by Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica .
44027003	The next day we put in at Sidon ; and Julius treated Paul kindly , and allowed him to go to his friends and be cared for .
44027004	We put out to sea from there and sailed under the lee of Cyprus , because the winds were against us .
44027005	When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we landed at Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy , and he put us aboard it .
44027007	When we had sailed slowly for a good many days , and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus , since the wind did not allow us to go farther , we sailed under the lee of Crete , off Salmone .
44027008	We sailed along it with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens , near which was the city of Lasea .
44027009	As much time had been lost , and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast had already gone by , Paul advised them ,
44027010	and said to them , » Men , I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and great loss , not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . «
44027011	But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship than by what was being said by Paul .
44027012	Because the harbor was not suitable to winter in , the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there , on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix , a harbor of Crete , facing southwest and northwest , and spend the winter there .
44027013	When a gentle south wind came up , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete , close inshore .
44027014	But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind , called the northeaster ;
44027015	and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind , we gave way to it and were driven along .
44027016	And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda , we were scarcely able to secure the boat .
44027017	After they had hoisted it up , they used supporting cables to undergird the ship ; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis , they lowered the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along .
44027018	The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed , they began to throw the cargo overboard ;
44027019	and on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands .
44027020	When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days , and no small storm was raging on us , all hope of our being saved was finally abandoned .
44027021	When they had gone a long time without food , then Paul stood up among them and said , » Men , you should have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss .
44027022	Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage ; for there will be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
44027023	For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me ,
44027024	and he said , ‘ Do not be afraid , Paul ; you must stand before Caesar ; and behold , God has granted you all those who sail with you . ’
44027025	So keep up your courage , men , for I have faith in God that it will happen exactly as I have been told .
44027026	But we must run aground on some island . «
44027027	But when the fourteenth night came , as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors began to sense that they were approaching land .
44027028	They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms ; and a little farther on they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms .
44027029	Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks , they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak .
44027030	But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the lifeboat into the sea , on the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow ,
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers , » Unless these men stay in the ship , you cannot be saved . «
44027032	Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it fall away .
44027033	As day was about to dawn , Paul urged them all to take some food , saying , » Today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and without food , having taken nothing .
44027034	Therefore I urge you to take some food ; it will give you strength , since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you . «
44027035	Having said this , he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all , and he broke it and began to eat .
44027036	Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves .
44027037	All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons .
44027038	When they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea .
44027039	When day came , they could not recognize the land , but they did observe a bay with a beach , and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could .
44027040	So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea , at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders ; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach .
44027041	But striking a sandbar they ran the vessel aground ; the bow stuck fast and remained immovable , and the stern was broken up by the pounding of the surf .
44027042	The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners , so that none of them would swim away and escape .
44027043	But the centurion , wanting to bring Paul safely through , kept them from carrying out their plan . He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land ,
44027044	and the rest on planks or on various pieces of the ship . And so it happened that they were all brought safely to land .
44028001	When we had been brought safely through , then we found out that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The natives showed us unusual kindness , for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all , because it had begun to rain and was cold .
44028003	But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand .
44028004	When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said to one another , » No doubt this man is a murderer . Though he has escaped from the sea , justice has not allowed him to live . «
44028005	However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm .
44028006	They waited , expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead ; but after they had waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him , they changed their minds and said that he was a god .
44028007	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island , named Publius , who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days .
44028008	It happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed sick with recurrent fever and dysentery ; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed , he laid his hands on him and healed him .
44028009	When this had happened , the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured .
44028010	They honored us in many ways ; and when we were ready to sail , they furnished us with the supplies we needed .
44028011	After three months we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island , an Alexandrian ship , with the Twin Brothers as figurehead .
44028012	After we put in at Syracuse , we stayed there for three days .
44028013	From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium , and a day later a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli .
44028014	There we found some brethren , and were invited to stay with them for seven days . And so we came to Rome .
44028015	And the brethren , when they heard of us , came from there as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us . When Paul saw them , he thanked God and took courage .
44028016	And when we came into Rome , Paul was allowed to stay by himself , with the soldier that guarded him .
44028017	After three days Paul called together the local leaders of the Jews ; and when they had gathered , he said to them , » Brethren , though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers , yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
44028018	And when they had examined me , they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death .
44028019	But when the Jews objected , I was compelled to appeal to Caesar — not that I had any charge to bring against my own nation .
44028020	For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you , since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain . «
44028021	They said to him , » We have not received letters from Judea concerning you , and none of the brethren who have come here has reported or spoken anything bad about you .
44028022	But we desire to hear from you what your views are ; for concerning this sect , we know that everywhere it is spoken against . «
44028023	When they had appointed a day for Paul , they came to him at his lodging in great numbers . And he explained the matter to them from morning till evening , testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets .
44028024	Some were convinced by what he said , but others would not believe .
44028025	When they disagreed among themselves , they began to leave , after Paul had made one final statement : » The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet :
44028026	saying , ‘ Go to this people and say , » you will be ever hearing , but will never understand ; and you will be ever seeing , but will never perceive .
44028027	
44028028	Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles ; they will listen . «
44028030	And he stayed there two whole years in his own rented quarters and welcomed all who came to him ,
44028031	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly and unhindered .
45001001	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , set apart for the gospel of God
45001002	which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures ,
45001003	concerning his Son , who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh ,
45001004	and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord .
45001005	Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations ,
45001006	among whom you also are called to belong to Jesus Christ ;
45001007	To all in Rome who are beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is proclaimed in all the world .
45001009	For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers ,
45001010	asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last find the way to come to you .
45001011	For I long to see you , so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you —
45001012	that is , that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith .
45001013	I do not want you to be unaware , brethren , that I often planned to come to you ( but have been prevented from doing so until now ) in order that I might have some harvest among you , just as I have had among the other Gentiles .
45001014	I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians , both to the wise and to the foolish :
45001015	so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel : for it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45001017	For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith ; as it is written , » The just shall live by faith . «
45001018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth ,
45001019	for what may be known about God is plain to them , because God has shown it to them .
45001020	For since the creation of the world his invisible nature , even his eternal power and deity , has been clearly seen , being understood by the things that have been made . So they are without excuse ;
45001021	for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him , but they became futile in their thinking , and their foolish hearts were darkened .
45001022	Claiming to be wise , they became fools ,
45001023	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles .
45001024	Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity , to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves ,
45001025	because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
45001026	For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions . Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural .
45001027	And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another , men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error .
45001028	And since they did not see fit to retain the knowledge of God , God gave them over to a base mind , to do what ought not to be done .
45001029	They were filled with all manner of wickedness , evil , covetousness , depravity . Full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malice ; they are gossips ,
45001030	slanderers , haters of God , insolent , arrogant , boastful , inventors of evil , disobedient to parents ,
45001031	foolish , faithless , heartless , ruthless .
45001032	Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death , they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them .
45002001	Therefore you have no excuse , O man , whoever you are who judge another ; for in whatever point you pass judgment on him you condemn yourself , because you , the judge , are doing the very same things .
45002002	We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things .
45002003	Do you think , O man , that when you judge those who do such things and yet do the same yourself , you will escape the judgment of God ?
45002004	Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience ? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance ?
45002005	But by your hardness and your impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed .
45002006	For he » will render to each one according to his works « :
45002007	to those who by patience in doing good seek for glory , honor , and immortality , he will give eternal life ;
45002008	but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth , but obey wickedness , there will be wrath and fury .
45002009	There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil , the Jew first and also the Greek ,
45002010	but glory , honor , and peace for everyone who does good , the Jew first and also the Greek .
45002011	For God shows no partiality .
45002012	All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law , and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
45002013	For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God , but the doers of the law who will be justified .
45002014	When Gentiles , who have not the law , do by nature things required by the law , they are a law to themselves , even though they do not have the law .
45002015	They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts accusing or else excusing them
45002016	on that day when , according to my gospel , God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus .
45002017	But if you call yourself a Jew , and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God
45002018	and know his will and approve of what is excellent , because you are instructed in the law ,
45002019	and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45002020	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of infants , having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth —
45002021	you , then , who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , do you steal ?
45002022	You who say that one must not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who boast in the law , do you dishonor God by breaking the law ?
45002024	For , as it is written , » The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you . «
45002025	Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law ; but if you break the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
45002026	So , if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision ?
45002027	The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who , even though you have the written code and circumcision , are a breaker of the law .
45002028	For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly , nor is true circumcision something outward and in the flesh .
45002029	He is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and real circumcision is a matter of the heart , by the Spirit , and not by the written code . His praise is not from men but from God .
45003001	Then what advantage has the Jew , or what is the value of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way ! To begin with , they are entrusted with the oracles of God .
45003003	What if some did not have faith ? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God ?
45003004	Certainly not ! Let God be true , though every man a liar . As it is written : » That you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged . «
45003005	But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us ? ( I speak in a human way . )
45003006	Certainly not ! For then how could God judge the world ?
45003007	But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory , why am I still being condemned as a sinner ?
45003008	Why not say – as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say — » Let us do evil that good may come « ? Their condemnation is just .
45003009	What then ? Are we Jews any better off ? Certainly not ; for we have already charged that all men , both Jews and Greeks , are under the power of sin .
45003010	As it is written : » There is none righteous , no , not one ;
45003011	
45003012	
45003013	
45003014	
45003015	
45003016	
45003017	
45003018	
45003019	Now we know that whatever the law says , it says to those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God .
45003020	Therefore no flesh will be justified in his sight by works of the law , for through the law comes knowledge of sin .
45003021	But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart from law , although the law and the prophets bear witness to it ,
45003022	the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe . For there is no difference ,
45003023	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
45003024	and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ,
45003025	whom God put forward as an atoning sacrifice by his blood , to be received through faith . This was to demonstrate his righteousness , because in his divine forbearance he had passed over sins committed beforehand ;
45003026	and it was to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time , that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus .
45003027	Where then is our boasting ? It is excluded . On what law ? On the law of works ? No , but on the law of faith .
45003028	For we hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law .
45003029	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Is he not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
45003030	since there is one God , who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through their faith .
45003031	Do we then nullify the law by this faith ? Certainly not ! On the contrary , we uphold the law .
45004001	What then shall we say that Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh , has found ?
45004002	For if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not before God .
45004003	For what does the scripture say ? » Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness . «
45004004	Now to him who works , his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due .
45004005	And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is reckoned as righteousness .
45004006	So also David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works :
45004007	
45004008	
45004009	Is this blessedness only upon the circumcised , or also upon the uncircumcised ? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness .
45004010	How then was it reckoned to him ? Was it after he had been circumcised , or before ? It was not after , but before he was circumcised .
45004011	And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised , that he might be the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised , in order that righteousness might be reckoned to them .
45004012	And he is also the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
45004013	The promise to Abraham and his descendants , that he would be heir of the world , was not through the law but through the righteousness of faith .
45004014	For if those who are of the law are to be the heirs , faith has no value and the promise is void ,
45004015	because the law brings wrath , for where there is no law there is no transgression .
45004016	Therefore , the promise comes by faith , so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all his descendants — not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham , for he is the father of us all
45004017	( as it is written , » I have made you the father of many nations « ) in the presence of the God in whom he believed , who gives life to the dead and calls things that do not exist as though they did .
45004018	In hope , he believed against hope , so that he became the father of many nations ; as he had been told , » So shall your descendants be . «
45004019	And he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body , which was as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old , or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb .
45004020	He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief , but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God ,
45004021	being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised .
45004022	That is why it was » reckoned to him as righteousness . «
45004023	But the words , » it was reckoned to him , « were written not for his sake alone ,
45004024	but for us also . It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord ,
45004025	who was delivered to death for our sins and was raised for our justification .
45005001	Therefore , since we have been justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
45005002	through whom we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand , and we rejoice in our hope of the glory of God .
45005003	And not only that , but we rejoice in our sufferings , knowing that suffering produces perseverance ;
45005004	and perseverance , character ; and character , hope .
45005005	And hope does not disappoint us , because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us .
45005006	When we were still weak , at the right time Christ died for the ungodly .
45005007	Why , one will hardly die for a righteous man — though perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die .
45005008	But God demonstrates his own love for us , in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us .
45005009	Since , therefore , we have now been justified by his blood , much more shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God .
45005010	For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , having been reconciled , shall we be saved by his life .
45005011	Not only so , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received our reconciliation .
45005012	Therefore , just as sin entered the world through one man , and death through sin , so death spread to all men , because all men sinned .
45005013	For sin was in the world before the law was given , but sin is not counted when there is no law .
45005014	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam , who was a type of the one who was to come .
45005015	But the free gift is not like the trespass . For if by the one man's trespass many died , much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abounded to many .
45005016	And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin . For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation , but the gift following many trespasses brings justification .
45005017	For if , by the one man's trespass , death reigned through that one man , much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ . )
45005018	So then , as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men , so one man’s act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men .
45005019	For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous .
45005020	Law came in , that the trespass might increase . But where sin increased , grace abounded all the more ,
45005021	so that , as sin reigned in death , grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	What shall we say then ? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound ?
45006002	Certainly not ! How can we who died to sin live any longer in it ?
45006003	Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
45006004	We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death , so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father , we too might walk in newness of life .
45006005	For if we have been united with him in a death like his , we shall certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his .
45006006	We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with , that we should no longer be slaves to sin .
45006007	For he who has died has been freed from sin .
45006008	Now if we died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him .
45006009	For we know that Christ , being raised from the dead , will never die again ; death no longer has dominion over him .
45006010	The death he died , he died to sin once for all ; but the life he lives , he lives to God .
45006011	So you also , consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body , that you obey its passions .
45006013	Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness , but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to life , and your members to God as instruments of righteousness .
45006014	For sin shall not have dominion over you , since you are not under law but under grace .
45006015	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? Certainly not !
45006016	Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one to obey as slaves , you are slaves of the one whom you obey , whether of sin , which leads to death , or of obedience , which leads to righteousness ?
45006017	But thanks be to God , that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed ,
45006018	and , having been set free from sin , you have become slaves of righteousness .
45006019	I am speaking in human terms , because of the weakness of your flesh . For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity , so now yield your members to righteousness for holiness .
45006020	When you were slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
45006021	But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed ? The end of those things is death .
45006022	But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God , the return you get is holiness and its end , eternal life .
45006023	For the wages of sin is death , but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Do you not know , brethren — for I am speaking to those who know the law — that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives ?
45007002	For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives , but if her husband dies she is released from the law of her husband .
45007003	So then , she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free from that law , and though she marries another man , she is not an adulteress .
45007004	Likewise , my brethren , you have died to the law through the body of Christ , so that you may belong to another , to him who was raised from the dead , in order that we may bear fruit to God .
45007005	While we were living in the flesh , our sinful passions , aroused by the law , were at work in our members to bear fruit for death .
45007006	But now , by dying to what once held us , we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit , and not in the old way of the written code .
45007007	What shall we say , then ? Is the law sin ? Certainly not ! Indeed , I would not have known what sin was except through the law . For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said , » You shall not covet . «
45007008	But sin , finding opportunity by the commandment , produced in me all kinds of covetous desire . For apart from the law sin lies dead .
45007009	I was once alive apart from the law , but when the commandment came , sin sprang to life and I died .
45007010	The very commandment which was to bring life I found to be death to me .
45007011	For sin , finding opportunity in the commandment , deceived me , and by it killed me .
45007012	So the law is holy , and the commandment is holy and just and good .
45007013	Did that which is good , then , become death to me ? Certainly not ! But it was sin , working death in me through what is good , in order that sin might be recognized as sin , so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure .
45007014	We know that the law is spiritual ; but I am carnal , sold under sin .
45007015	I do not understand what I do . For I do not do what I want to do , but I do what I hate .
45007016	Now if I do what I do not want to do , I agree that the law is good .
45007017	So then , it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells within me .
45007018	For I know that nothing good dwells within me , that is , in my flesh . I can will to do what is good , but I cannot do it .
45007019	For I do not do the good I want to do ; but the evil I do not want to do is what I do .
45007020	Now if I do what I do not want to do , it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells within me .
45007021	So I find it to be a law that when I want to do good , evil is present with me .
45007022	For I delight in the law of God , in my inner being ,
45007023	but I see in my members another law , at war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members .
45007024	Wretched man that I am ! Who will deliver me from this body of death ?
45007025	Thanks be to God — through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I of myself serve the law of God with my mind , but with my flesh I serve the law of sin .
45008001	There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death .
45008003	For what the law could not do , in that it was weakened through the flesh , God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin : he condemned sin in the flesh ,
45008004	in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us , who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
45008005	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit .
45008006	To set the mind on the flesh is death , but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace .
45008007	For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God ; it does not submit to God's law , nor can it do so ;
45008008	and those who are in the flesh cannot please God .
45008009	But you are not in the flesh , you are in the Spirit , if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you . And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him .
45008010	But if Christ is in you , although your body is dead because of sin , your spirit is alive because of righteousness .
45008011	If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you .
45008012	Therefore , brethren , we are debtors — not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
45008013	For if you live according to the flesh you will die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
45008014	For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God .
45008015	For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear , but you received the Spirit of sonship by whom we cry out , » Abba , Father . «
45008016	The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God ,
45008017	and if children , then heirs — heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ , if indeed we suffer with him , in order that we may also be glorified with him .
45008018	I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us .
45008019	For the creation waits with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God .
45008020	For the creation was subjected to futility , not of its own will , but by the will of him who subjected it in hope ;
45008021	because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God .
45008022	We know that the whole creation has been groaning in birth pangs together until now .
45008023	And not only the creation , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons , the redemption of our bodies .
45008024	For in this hope we were saved . But hope that is seen is not hope . For who hopes for what he sees ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we do not see , we wait for it with patience .
45008026	Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness ; for we do not know what to pray for as we ought , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express .
45008027	And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God .
45008028	And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him , who are called according to his purpose .
45008029	For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
45008030	And those whom he predestined , he also called ; those whom he called , he also justified ; and those whom he justified , he also glorified .
45008031	What then shall we say to this ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	He who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all , how will he not also give us all things with him ?
45008033	Who shall bring any charge against God's elect ? It is God who justifies .
45008034	Who is he who condemns ? It is Christ Jesus , who died , yes , who was raised from the dead , who is at the right hand of God , who is also interceding for us .
45008035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
45008036	As it is written : » For your sake we are being killed all the day long ; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered . «
45008037	No , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
45008038	For I am persuaded that neither death nor life , nor angels nor principalities , nor things present nor things to come , nor powers ,
45008039	nor height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I am speaking the truth in Christ , I am not lying ; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit ,
45009002	that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart .
45009003	For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh .
45009004	They are Israelites , and to them belong the adoption , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the worship , and the promises .
45009005	Of them are the patriarchs , and from them , according to the flesh , is the Christ , who is God over all , forever blessed . Amen .
45009006	But it is not as though the word of God had failed . For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel ,
45009007	nor are they all children of Abraham because they are his descendants ; but , » Through Isaac shall your descendants be named . «
45009008	In other words , it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God , but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants .
45009009	For this is what the promise said : » About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son . «
45009010	And not only so , but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man , our father Isaac ,
45009011	though the twins were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad , in order that God's purpose of election might stand , not because of works but because of his call ,
45009012	she was told , » The older will serve the younger . «
45009013	As it is written , » Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . «
45009014	What shall we say then ? Is there injustice with God ? Certainly not !
45009015	For he says to Moses , » I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . «
45009016	So it depends not upon man's will or exertion , but upon God's mercy .
45009017	For the scripture says to Pharaoh , » I have raised you up for this very purpose , that I may show my power in you , and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth . «
45009018	Therefore he has mercy on whom he wills , and he hardens the heart of whom he wills .
45009019	You will say to me then , » Why does he still find fault ? For who can resist his will ? «
45009020	But who are you , O man , to answer back to God ? Will what is formed say to him who formed it , » Why have you made me like this ? «
45009021	Does not the potter have right over the clay , to make out of the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor ?
45009022	What if God , choosing to show his wrath and to make his power known , endured with much patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction ,
45009023	in order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy , which he has prepared beforehand for glory ,
45009024	even us whom he has called , not from the Jews only , but also from the Gentiles ?
45009025	As indeed he says in Hosea : » I will call them who were not my people ‘ my people , ’ and her who was not beloved I will call ‘ my beloved . ’ «
45009026	
45009027	And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel : » Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea , only the remnant will be saved .
45009028	For the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth with speed and finality . «
45009029	And as Isaiah said : » Unless the Lord of hosts had left us children , we would have become like Sodom , and we would have been made like Gomorrah . «
45009030	What shall we say , then ? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it , that is , righteousness through faith ;
45009031	but Israel , who pursued the law of righteousness , has not attained that law .
45009032	Why ? Because they did not pursue it by faith , but as if it were by works . They have stumbled over the stumbling stone ,
45009033	as it is written : » Behold , I lay in Zion a stone that will make men stumble , and a rock that will make them fall ; and he who believes in him will not be put to shame . «
45010001	Brethren , my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved .
45010002	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God , but it is not according to knowledge .
45010003	For , being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God , and seeking to establish their own , they did not submit to God's righteousness .
45010004	For Christ is the end of the law , that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes .
45010005	For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law , » The man who does those things shall live by them . «
45010006	But the righteousness based on faith says , » Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ « ( that is , to bring Christ down )
45010007	or » Who will descend into the abyss ? « ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
45010008	But what does it say ? » The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart « ( that is , the word of faith which we preach ) ;
45010009	because , if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	For man believes with his heart and so is justified , and he confesses with his mouth and so is saved .
45010011	The scripture says , » No one who believes in him will be put to shame . «
45010012	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches on all who call upon him .
45010013	For , » everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . «
45010014	How then can they call on him in whom they have not believed ? And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? And how can they hear without a preacher ?
45010015	And how can they preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , » How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news ! «
45010016	But they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Isaiah says , » Lord , who has believed our message ? «
45010017	So faith comes from hearing , and hearing by the word of Christ .
45010018	But I ask , have they not heard ? Indeed they have ; for » Their voice has gone out to all the earth , and their words to the ends of the world . «
45010019	Again I ask , did Israel not understand ? First Moses says , » I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation ; by a foolish nation I will make you angry . «
45010020	But Isaiah is very bold and says , » I was found by those who did not seek me ; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me . «
45010021	But of Israel he says , » All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people . «
45011001	I ask , then , has God rejected his people ? Certainly not ! I myself am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , a member of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew . Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ? —
45011003	» Lord , they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars , and I alone am left , and they seek my life . «
45011004	But what is God's reply to him ? » I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal . «
45011005	So too at the present time there is a remnant , chosen by grace .
45011006	And if it is by grace , then it is no longer on the basis of works ; otherwise , grace would no longer be grace .
45011007	What then ? Israel did not obtain what it sought . The elect obtained it , but the rest were hardened ,
45011008	as it is written : » God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear , down to this very day . «
45011009	And David says : » Let their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them .
45011010	
45011011	So I ask , have they stumbled so as to fall ? Certainly not ! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles , to make Israel jealous .
45011012	Now if their trespass means riches for the world , and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their fullness mean !
45011013	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I magnify my ministry
45011014	in the hope that I may somehow arouse to jealousy the kinsmen of my flesh and save some of them .
45011015	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
45011016	If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy , then the whole lump is holy ; and if the root is holy , so are the branches .
45011017	And if some of the branches were broken off , and you , a wild olive shoot , were grafted in among the rest to share the root of the olive tree ,
45011018	do not boast over the branches . If you do boast , remember that you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
45011019	You will say then , » Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in . «
45011020	That is true . They were broken off because of their unbelief , but you stand fast only by faith . So do not be proud , but stand in awe .
45011021	For if God did not spare the natural branches , he will not spare you either .
45011022	Therefore consider the kindness and the severity of God : severity toward those who fell , but kindness to you , provided you continue in his kindness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
45011023	And they also , if they do not persist in unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature , and were grafted , contrary to nature , into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree !
45011025	I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery , brothers , so that you may not be conceited : Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in .
45011026	And so all Israel will be saved , as it is written : » The Deliverer will come from Zion , he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob ;
45011027	
45011028	As regards the gospel they are enemies of God , for your sake ; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers .
45011029	For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable .
45011030	Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience ,
45011031	so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy .
45011032	For God has bound all men over to disobedience , that he may have mercy upon all .
45011033	Oh , the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out !
45011034	
45011035	
45011036	For from him and through him and to him are all things . To him be glory forever . Amen .
45012001	I appeal to you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God , which is your spiritual worship .
45012002	Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , that you may prove what is the will of God , what is good and acceptable and perfect .
45012003	For by the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think , but to think with sober judgment , each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned him .
45012004	For as in one body we have many members , and all the members do not have the same function ,
45012005	so we , though many , are one body in Christ , and individually members one of another .
45012006	Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us , let us use them : if prophecy , in proportion to our faith ;
45012007	if service , let us use it in our serving ; he who teaches , in his teaching ;
45012008	he who exhorts , in exhortation ; he who gives , with liberality ; he who leads , with diligence ; he who does acts of mercy , with cheerfulness .
45012009	Let love be genuine . Hate what is evil ; cling to what is good .
45012010	Be devoted to one another in brotherly love ; outdo one another in showing honor .
45012011	Never be lacking in zeal , be fervent in spirit , serving the Lord .
45012012	Rejoice in your hope , be patient in tribulation , be faithful in prayer .
45012013	Contribute to the needs of the saints , practice hospitality .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you ; bless and do not curse .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep .
45012016	Live in harmony with one another . Do not be proud , but associate with the lowly . Do not be conceited .
45012017	Repay no one evil for evil , but have regard for what is noble in the sight of all .
45012018	If it is possible , as far as it depends on you , live peaceably with all .
45012019	Beloved , do not avenge yourselves , but leave it to the wrath of God ; for it is written , » Vengeance is mine , I will repay , « says the Lord .
45012020	No , » if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him drink ; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head . «
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
45013001	Let every person be subject to the governing authorities . For there is no authority except from God , and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God .
45013002	Therefore he who resists the authority resists what God has appointed , and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves .
45013003	For rulers are not a terror to good works , but to evil . Do you want to have no fear of him who is in authority ? Then do what is good , and you will have praise from him .
45013004	For he is God's servant to you for good . But if you do wrong , be afraid , for he does not bear the sword in vain ; he is God’s servant , an avenger to execute wrath on the wrongdoer .
45013005	Therefore one must be subject , not only because of wrath but also for the sake of conscience .
45013006	For the same reason you also pay taxes , for the authorities are God's ministers , attending to this very thing .
45013007	Pay all of them their dues : taxes to whom taxes are due , revenue to whom revenue is due , respect to whom respect is due , honor to whom honor is due .
45013008	Owe no one anything , except to love one another ; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law .
45013009	The commandments , » You shall not commit adultery , « » You shall not murder , « » You shall not steal , « » You shall not covet , « and any other commandment there may be , are summed up in this sentence , » You shall love your neighbor as yourself . «
45013010	Love does no harm to a neighbor ; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law .
45013011	And do this , knowing the hour , that now it is full time for you to wake from sleep . For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed .
45013012	The night is far gone , the day is at hand . Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light .
45013013	Let us walk properly , as in the day , not in reveling and drunkenness , not in lewdness and lust , not in quarreling and jealousy .
45013014	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh , to gratify its desires .
45014001	As for the man who is weak in faith , accept him , but not for disputes over opinions .
45014002	One believes he may eat anything , but the man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables .
45014003	Let not him who eats despise him who does not , and let not him who does not eat pass judgment on him who eats ; for God has accepted him .
45014004	Who are you to judge the servant of another ? To his own master he stands or falls . And he will be made to stand , for the Master is able to make him stand .
45014005	One man esteems one day as better than another ; another man esteems every day alike . Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind .
45014006	He who observes the day , observes it to the Lord . He who eats , eats to the Lord , for he gives thanks to God ; and he who abstains , does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God .
45014007	For none of us lives to himself , and none of us dies to himself .
45014008	If we live , we live to the Lord ; and if we die , we die to the Lord . So then , whether we live or whether we die , we are the Lord's .
45014009	For to this end Christ died and lived again , that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living .
45014010	Why do you judge your brother ? Or you , why do you despise your brother ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God .
45014011	For it is written : » As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God . «
45014012	So then each of us shall give account of himself to God .
45014013	Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another anymore , but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in our brother’s way .
45014014	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself ; but if anyone regards something as unclean , then for him it is unclean .
45014015	If your brother is distressed because of what you eat , you are no longer walking in love . Do not by your eating destroy the one for whom Christ died .
45014016	So do not let your good be spoken of as evil .
45014017	For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit ;
45014018	he who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men .
45014019	Let us therefore pursue what makes for peace and for mutual edification .
45014020	Do not , for the sake of food , destroy the work of God . Everything is indeed clean , but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble .
45014021	It is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble .
45014022	The faith that you have , keep between yourself and God . Happy is he who does not condemn himself for what he approves .
45014023	But he who has doubts is condemned if he eats , because he does not act from faith ; for whatever is not from faith is sin .
45015001	We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
45015002	Let each of us please his neighbor for his good , to build him up .
45015003	For even Christ did not please himself ; but , as it is written , » The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me . «
45015004	For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction , that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope .
45015005	May the God of patience and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another , according to Christ Jesus ,
45015006	that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Therefore , welcome one another , just as Christ also welcomed you , to the glory of God .
45015008	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised to show God's truth , to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs ,
45015009	and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . As it is written : » Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles , and sing to your name « ;
45015010	and again it says : » Rejoice , O Gentiles , with his people ! «
45015011	and again , » Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and praise him , all you peoples « ;
45015012	And again , Isaiah says : » There shall be a root of Jesse ; and he who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles , in him the Gentiles shall hope . «
45015013	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope .
45015014	I myself am satisfied about you , my brethren , that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , and able to instruct one another .
45015015	But I have written very boldly to you on some points , so as to remind you again , because of the grace that was given me from God ,
45015016	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God , so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God .
45015018	For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles , by word and deed —
45015019	by the power of signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit , so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
45015020	And so I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel , not where Christ has already been named , lest I build on another man's foundation ,
45015021	but as it is written : » They shall see who have not been told of him , and those who have not heard shall understand . «
45015022	This is the reason why I have often been hindered from coming to you .
45015023	But now , since I no longer have any place for work in these regions , and since I have longed for many years to come to you ,
45015024	I plan to do so when I go to Spain . I hope to see you while passing through , and to be helped by you on my journey there , after I have enjoyed your company for a while .
45015025	Now , however , I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints .
45015026	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem .
45015027	They were pleased to do it , and indeed they are in debt to them . For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings , they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings .
45015028	When therefore I have completed this , and have delivered to them this fruit , I shall go on by way of you to Spain .
45015029	And I know that when I come to you , I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ .
45015030	Now I urge you , brethren , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
45015031	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea , and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ,
45015032	so that by God's will I may come to you with joy , and together with you be refreshed .
45015033	The God of peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	I commend to you Phoebe our sister , who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea ,
45016002	that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints , and help her in whatever she has need from you , for she has been a helper of many and of myself also .
45016003	Greet Priscilla and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	who risked their necks for my life , to whom not only I but also all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks ;
45016005	greet also the church that meets in their house . Greet my beloved Epaenetus , who was the first convert of Asia for Christ .
45016006	Greet Mary , who has worked hard for you .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junias , my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners ; they are men of note among the apostles , and they were in Christ before me .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus , my beloved in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and Stachys my beloved .
45016010	Greet Apelles , who is approved in Christ . Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet Herodion , my kinsman . Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord .
45016012	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa , those workers in the Lord . Greet the beloved Persis , who has worked hard in the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brethren who are with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ greet you .
45016017	I urge you , brethren , to take note of those who cause divisions and difficulties , contrary to the doctrine which you have learned ; avoid them .
45016018	For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ , but their own appetites , and by smooth and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the simple .
45016019	For your obedience has become known to all , so I am full of joy over you ; but I want you to be wise about what is good , and innocent about what is evil .
45016020	And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , greets you , as do Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my kinsmen .
45016022	I , Tertius , who wrote this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , who is my host and the host of the whole church , greets you . Erastus , the treasurer of the city , greets you , and Quartus , our brother .
45016025	Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret for long ages
45016026	but is now revealed and made known to all nations through the prophetic writings , according to the command of the eternal God , to bring about the obedience of faith —
45016027	to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ ! Amen .
46001001	Paul , called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and our brother Sosthenes ,
46001002	to the church of God which is at Corinth , to those sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , both their Lord and ours :
46001003	grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ,
46001005	that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge —
46001006	even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you ,
46001007	so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift , as you eagerly wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
46001008	who will also confirm you to the end , blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful , by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	I appeal to you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment .
46001011	For I have been informed by Chloe's people , that there are quarrels among you , my brethren .
46001012	What I mean is this , that each one of you says , » I am of Paul , « and » I of Apollos , « and » I of Cephas , « and » I of Christ . «
46001013	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that no one would say you were baptized in my name .
46001016	( Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas ; beyond that , I do not know whether I baptized any one else . )
46001017	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the gospel — not with words of human wisdom , lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power .
46001018	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
46001019	For it is written , » I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and the cleverness of the clever I will frustrate . «
46001020	Where is the wise man ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the debater of this age ? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
46001021	For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God , God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe .
46001022	Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom ,
46001023	but we preach Christ crucified , to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness ,
46001024	but to those who are the called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
46001026	For consider your call , brethren ; not many of you were wise according to fleshly standards , not many were powerful , not many were of noble birth .
46001027	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise , God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong ,
46001028	God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things , and the things that are not , to nullify the things that are ,
46001029	so that no flesh may boast before God .
46001030	It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus , who became to us wisdom from God , and righteousness and sanctification , and redemption ,
46001031	therefore , as it is written , » Let him who boasts , boast in the Lord . «
46002001	When I came to you , brethren , I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
46002002	For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
46002003	I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling ,
46002004	and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
46002005	so that your faith might not rest on the wisdom of men , but on the power of God .
46002006	Yet we do speak a wisdom among the mature , a wisdom , however , not of this age nor of the rulers of this age , who are passing away .
46002007	But we speak of God's secret wisdom , a wisdom that has been hidden and which God destined for our glory before the ages .
46002008	None of the rulers of this age understood it ; for if they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But , as it is written , » No eye has seen , nor ear heard , nor the heart of man conceived what God has prepared for those who love him , «
46002010	God has revealed them to us through the Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , even the depths of God .
46002011	For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit which is in him ? Even so no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
46002012	Now we have received not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , that we may understand the things freely given to us by God .
46002013	This is what we speak , not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit , expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words .
46002014	But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him ; and he cannot understand them , because they are spiritually discerned .
46002015	But the spiritual man judges all things , yet he himself is rightly judged by no one .
46002016	
46003001	But I , brethren , could not address you as spiritual men , but as carnal men , as infants in Christ .
46003002	I gave you milk , not solid food ; for you were not yet ready for it . Indeed , even now you are not ready ,
46003003	for you are still carnal . For since there is jealousy and strife among you , are you not carnal , and are you not walking like mere men ?
46003004	For when one says , » I am of Paul , « and another , » I am of Apollos , « are you not mere men ?
46003005	What then is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? Servants through whom you believed , even as the Lord assigned to each one .
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God was causing the growth .
46003007	So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything , but only God who gives the growth .
46003008	Now he who plants and he who waters are one , and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
46003009	For we are God's fellow workers ; you are God’s field , God’s building .
46003010	According to the grace of God which was given to me , like a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another is building on it . But each man must be careful how he builds on it .
46003011	For no other foundation can any one lay than the one which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
46003013	each man's work will become evident ; for the day will show it , because it is to be revealed with fire , and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work .
46003014	If any man's work which he has built on it survives , he will receive a reward .
46003015	If any man's work is burned up , he will suffer loss ; but he himself will be saved , but only as through fire .
46003016	Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you ?
46003017	If any one destroys God's temple , God will destroy him . For God’s temple is holy , and that temple you are .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age , he must become a fool so that he may become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written , » He catches the wise in their own craftiness « ;
46003020	and again , » The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are futile . «
46003021	So then let no one boast of men . For all things are yours ,
46003022	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future ; all belong to you ,
46003023	and you belong to Christ ; and Christ belongs to God .
46004001	This is how one should regard us , as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God .
46004002	Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy .
46004003	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by any human court ; I do not even judge myself .
46004004	I am not aware of anything against myself , but I am not acquitted by this . It is the Lord who judges me .
46004005	Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time , but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's hearts . Then every man will receive his praise from God .
46004006	Now these things , brethren , I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your benefit , so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written , so that no one of you will become arrogant in favor of one against the other .
46004007	For who regards you as different ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
46004008	You are already filled ! You have already become rich ! You have become kings without us ! And indeed , I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you .
46004009	For , I think that God has exhibited us apostles last of all , like men condemned to death ; because we have become a spectacle to the world , both to angels and to men .
46004010	We are fools for Christ's sake , but you are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but you are strong ; you are distinguished , but we are without honor .
46004011	To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty , and we are poorly clothed , and roughly treated , and homeless ;
46004012	and we toil , working with our own hands . When we are reviled , we bless ; when we are persecuted , we endure ;
46004013	when we are slandered , we try to conciliate ; we have become , and are now , as the scum of the world , the refuse of all things .
46004014	I do not write this to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved children .
46004015	For though you have countless guides in Christ , you do not have many fathers , for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel .
46004016	Therefore I urge you , be imitators of me .
46004017	For this reason I have sent to you Timothy , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , just as I teach everywhere in every church .
46004018	Now some have become arrogant , as though I were not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you soon , if the Lord wills , and I will find out , not the words of these arrogant people , but their power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power .
46004021	What do you desire ? Shall I come to you with a rod , or with love and a spirit of gentleness ?
46005001	It is actually reported that there is immorality among you , and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans : a man has his father's wife .
46005002	And you are arrogant ! Ought you not rather to have mourned ? Let the one who has done this be removed from your midst .
46005003	For though I am absent in body , I am present in spirit , and have already passed judgment on the one who has committed this , as if I were present .
46005004	In the name of our Lord Jesus , when you are assembled , and I with you in spirit , and the power of our Lord Jesus is present ,
46005005	you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
46005006	Your boasting is not good . Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough ?
46005007	Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump , as you really are unleavened . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
46005008	Let us , therefore , celebrate the festival , not with the old leaven , the leaven of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people ;
46005010	not at all meaning the immoral people of this world , or with the greedy and swindlers , or with idolaters , for then you would have to go out of the world .
46005011	But actually , I wrote to you not to associate with any one who bears the name of brother if he is an immoral person , or greedy , or an idolater , or a reviler , or a drunkard , or a swindler — not even to eat with such a one .
46005012	For what have I to do with judging outsiders ? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge ?
46005013	God judges those outside . » Expel the wicked man from among you . «
46006001	When any one of you has a grievance against a brother , does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of before the saints ?
46006002	Do you not know that the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is to be judged by you , are you not competent to try trivial cases ?
46006003	Do you not know that we will judge angels ? How much more matters of this life !
46006004	So if you have disputes about such matters , do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church ?
46006005	I say this to your shame . Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between his brethren ,
46006006	but brother goes to law against brother , and that before unbelievers ?
46006007	Actually , then , it is already a defeat for you , that you have lawsuits with one another . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
46006008	Instead , you yourselves defraud and do wrong , and you even do this to your brethren .
46006009	Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived ; neither the immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor sexual perverts ,
46006010	nor thieves , nor the greedy , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	And such were some of you . But you were washed , you were sanctified , you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	» All things are lawful for me , « but not all things are helpful . » All things are lawful for me , « but I will not be mastered by anything .
46006013	» Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food « — but God will destroy them both . The body is not meant for immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
46006014	By his power God raised the Lord , and he will also raise us up .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? Never !
46006016	Or do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her ? For , as it is written , » The two shall become one flesh . «
46006017	But he who unites himself with the Lord is one spirit with him .
46006018	Flee immorality . Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body , but the immoral man sins against his own body .
46006019	Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit , who is in you , whom you have received from God ? You are not your own ;
46006020	you were bought with a price . Therefore glorify God in your body .
46007001	Now concerning the matters about which you wrote , it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
46007002	But because of immorality , each man should have his own wife , and each woman her own husband .
46007003	The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife , and likewise the wife to her husband .
46007004	The wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does ; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
46007005	Do not deprive one another , except by agreement for a time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer , and then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	I say this by way of concession , not of command .
46007007	I wish that all men were as I myself am . But each man has his own gift from God , one in this manner and another in that .
46007008	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I .
46007009	But if they cannot exercise self-control , they should marry ; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
46007010	To the married I give charge , not I but the Lord , that the wife should not separate from her husband
46007011	( but if she does leave , she must remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband should not divorce his wife .
46007012	But to the rest I say , not the Lord , that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever , and she consents to live with him , he must not divorce her .
46007013	If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever , and he consents to live with her , she must not divorce him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her husband . Otherwise , your children would be unclean , but as it is they are holy .
46007015	But if the unbelieving partner leaves , let him do so ; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound . For God has called us to peace .
46007016	For how do you know , O wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , O husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46007017	Only , let each one lead the life which the Lord has assigned to him , and in which God has called him . This is the rule I lay down in all the churches .
46007018	Was any man called when he was already circumcised ? He is not to become uncircumcised . Has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? He is not to be circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing , but keeping the commandments of God is what counts .
46007020	Each one should remain in the state in which he was called .
46007021	Were you a slave when you were called ? Do not let it trouble you — but if you can gain your freedom , do so .
46007022	For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freedman ; likewise he who was free when called is Christ's slave .
46007023	You were bought with a price ; do not become slaves of men .
46007024	Brethren , let each one remain with God in that condition in which he was called .
46007025	Now concerning virgins , I have no command of the Lord , but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy .
46007026	I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be free . Are you free from a wife ? Do not seek marriage .
46007028	But if you marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Yet those who marry will have troubles in this flesh , and I am trying to spare you .
46007029	I mean , brethren , the appointed time has grown very short ; so that from now on , those who have wives should live as though they had none ,
46007030	and those who mourn , as though they were not mourning ; and those who rejoice , as though they were not rejoicing ; and those who buy , as though they did not possess ;
46007031	and those who use the world , as though they did not make full use of it . For the form of this world is passing away .
46007032	But I want you to be free from concern . One who is unmarried is concerned about the affairs of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
46007033	but a married man is concerned about the affairs of the world , how he may please his wife ,
46007034	and his interests are divided . The unmarried woman , and the virgin , is concerned about the affairs of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and spirit ; but the married woman is concerned about the affairs of the world , how she may please her husband .
46007035	This I say for your own benefit , not to put a restraint upon you , but to promote what is good and to secure undivided devotion to the Lord .
46007036	But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward his betrothed , if she is past her youth , and if it must be so , let him do what he wishes , he does not sin ; let them marry .
46007037	But he who stands firm in his heart , being under no constraint , but has control over his own will , and has decided this in his own heart , to keep her as his betrothed , he will do well .
46007038	So then he who marries his betrothed does well , and he who does not marry her will do better .
46007039	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to be married to whom she wishes , only in the Lord .
46007040	But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is ; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God .
46008001	Now concerning food sacrificed to idols : we know that we all possess knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
46008002	If anyone imagines that he knows something , he does not yet know as he ought to know .
46008003	But if anyone loves God , he is known by him .
46008004	Therefore concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no God but one .
46008005	For even if there are so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ( as indeed there are many » gods « and many » lords « ) ,
46008006	yet for us there is but one God , the Father , from whom are all things and for whom we exist ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and through whom we exist .
46008007	However , not all possess this knowledge . But some , being accustomed to idols , eat food as really sacrificed to an idol ; and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
46008008	But food will not commend us to God ; we are no worse if we do not eat , and no better if we do .
46008009	But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak .
46008010	For if a man sees you , who have knowledge , at table in an idol's temple , will not his conscience , if he is weak , be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols ?
46008011	And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed , the brother for whom Christ died .
46008012	Thus , sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak , you sin against Christ .
46008013	Therefore , if food causes my brother to fall , I will never eat meat again , so that I will not cause my brother to fall .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
46009002	If to others I am not an apostle , at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	This is my defense to those who would examine me .
46009004	Do we not have the right to food and drink ?
46009005	Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife , even as the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas ?
46009006	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living ?
46009007	Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit ? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk ?
46009008	Do I say this merely from a human point of view ? Does not the Law say the same thing ?
46009009	For it is written in the Law of Moses , » You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain . « Is it for oxen that God is concerned ?
46009010	Or is he speaking altogether for our sake ? Yes , for our sake it was written , because the plowman ought to plow in hope , and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops .
46009011	If we have sown spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you ?
46009012	If others share this right of support from you , do not we all the more ? Nevertheless , we did not make use of this right , but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ .
46009013	Do you not know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple , and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar ?
46009014	In the same way , the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel .
46009015	But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me . I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting .
46009016	For if I preach the gospel , I have nothing to boast of , for I am under compulsion . For woe is me if I do not preach the gospel !
46009017	For if I do this voluntarily , I have a reward ; but if it is not of my will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
46009018	What then is my reward ? Just this : that in my preaching I may offer the gospel free of charge , and so not make full use of my right in the gospel .
46009019	For though I am free from all men , I have made myself a slave to all , that I might win the more .
46009020	To the Jews I became as a Jew , in order to win Jews ; to those under the law I became as one under the law — though not being myself under the law — so that I might win those under the law .
46009021	To those who are without law , I became as one without law , though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ , so that I might win those who are without the law .
46009022	To the weak I became weak , that I might win the weak . I have become all things to all men , so that I might by all means save some .
46009023	I do it all for the sake of the gospel , that I may share in its blessings .
46009024	Do you not know that in a race all the runners run , but only one receives the prize ? Run in such a way that you may win .
46009025	Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things . They do it to receive a perishable wreath , but we an imperishable .
46009026	Therefore I do not run aimlessly . I do not box as a man beating the air .
46009027	But I discipline my body and make it my slave , so that , after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified .
46010001	For I do not want you to be unaware , brethren , that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea ;
46010002	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
46010003	and all ate the same spiritual food ;
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink , for they drank from a spiritual rock which followed them ; and the rock was Christ .
46010005	Nevertheless , with most of them God was not pleased ; for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
46010006	Now these things are examples for us , not to desire evil things as they did .
46010007	Do not be idolaters , as some of them were ; as it is written , » The people sat down to eat and drink , and stood up to play . «
46010008	We must not indulge in immorality as some of them did , and twenty-three thousand fell in one day .
46010009	We must not put the Lord to the test , as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents .
46010010	Nor grumble , as some of them did , and were destroyed by the destroyer .
46010011	Now these things happened to them as an example , and they were written down for our instruction , upon whom the ends of the ages have come .
46010012	Therefore let any one who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall .
46010013	No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man . And God is faithful , who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able , but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also , so that you will be able to endure it .
46010014	Therefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry .
46010015	I speak as to sensible men ; judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not a participation in the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not a participation in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Because there is one bread , we who are many are one body , for we all partake of the one bread .
46010018	Consider Israel after the flesh ; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar ?
46010019	What do I mean then ? That a thing offered to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
46010020	No , but I say that the things pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God . I do not want you to be partners with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
46010022	Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ?
46010023	» All things are lawful , « but not all things are helpful . » All things are lawful , « but not all things build up .
46010024	Let no one seek his own good , but the good of his neighbor .
46010025	Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience ;
46010026	for , » The earth is the Lord's , and everything in it . «
46010027	If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you want to go , eat whatever is set before you without raising questions of conscience .
46010028	But if anyone says to you , » This has been offered in sacrifice , « then do not eat it , both for the sake of the man who informed you and for conscience' sake —
46010029	the other man's conscience , I mean , not yours . For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience ?
46010030	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks ?
46010031	So , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
46010032	Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God ,
46010033	just as I try to please all men in everything I do , not seeking my own advantage , but that of many , that they may be saved .
46011001	Be imitators of me , as I am of Christ .
46011002	I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions , just as I delivered them to you .
46011003	But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man , and the man is the head of a woman , and God is the head of Christ .
46011004	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head .
46011005	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head — it is the same as if her head were shaved .
46011006	For if a woman does not cover her head , she should have her hair cut off ; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off , let her cover her head .
46011007	For a man ought not to cover his head , since he is the image and glory of God ; but the woman is the glory of man .
46011008	For man does not originate from woman , but woman from man ;
46011009	neither was man created for woman , but woman for man .
46011010	Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
46011011	In the Lord , however , woman is not independent of man , nor is man independent of woman .
46011012	For as woman was made from man , so also man is born of woman . And all things are from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves : is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ,
46011015	but if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? For her hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	If anyone wants to be contentious , we have no other practice , nor do the churches of God .
46011017	But in the following instructions , I do not praise you , because you come together not for the better but for the worse .
46011018	For , in the first place , when you come together as a church , I hear that there are divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
46011019	For there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized .
46011020	Therefore when you meet together , it is not the Lord's supper that you eat ,
46011021	for in eating , each one goes ahead with his own meal , and one is hungry and another is drunk .
46011022	What ! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you in this ? No , I will not .
46011023	For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you , that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread ,
46011024	and when he had given thanks , he broke it and said , » This is my body , which is for you ; do this in remembrance of me . «
46011025	In the same way he took the cup also after supper , saying , » This cup is the new covenant in my blood ; do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of me . «
46011026	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes .
46011027	Whoever , therefore , eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	Let a man examine himself , and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
46011029	For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself .
46011030	That is why many among you are weak and sick , and a number of you have fallen asleep .
46011031	But if we judged ourselves rightly , we would not be judged .
46011032	But when we are judged , we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world .
46011033	So then , my brethren , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
46011034	If anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , so that you will not come together for judgment . About the other things I will give directions when I come .
46012001	Now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , I do not want you to be uninformed .
46012002	You know that when you were pagans , you were led astray to mute idols , however you may have been moved .
46012003	Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says , » Jesus be cursed , « and no one can say , » Jesus is Lord , « except by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Now there are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit .
46012005	And there are varieties of service , but the same Lord .
46012006	There are varieties of working , but the same God who works all of them in all men .
46012007	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good .
46012008	To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom , and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit ,
46012009	to another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit ,
46012010	and to another the working of miracles , and to another prophecy , and to another distinguishing between spirits , to another various kinds of tongues , and to another the interpretation of tongues .
46012011	But one and the same Spirit works all these things , distributing to each one individually just as he wills .
46012012	For just as the body is one and has many members , and all the members of the body , though they are many , are one body , so it is with Christ .
46012013	For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body — whether Jews or Greeks , slaves or free — and we were all made to drink of one Spirit .
46012014	For the body is not made up of one member but of many .
46012015	If the foot should say , » Because I am not a hand , I do not belong to the body , « it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body .
46012016	And if the ear should say , » Because I am not an eye , I do not belong to the body , « it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where would be the hearing ? If the whole body were an ear , where would be the sense of smell ?
46012018	But now God has arranged the members in the body , each one of them , just as he desired .
46012019	If they were all one member , where would the body be ?
46012020	As it is , there are many parts , but one body .
46012021	And the eye cannot say to the hand , » I have no need of you , « nor again the head to the feet , » I have no need of you . «
46012022	On the contrary , the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable ,
46012023	and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we treat with the greater honor , and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty ,
46012024	while our more presentable members have no need of it . But God has so composed the body , giving the greater honor to the parts that lacked it ,
46012025	so that there may be no division in the body , but that the members may have the same care for one another .
46012026	And if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it ; if one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
46012027	Now you are the body of Christ , and individually members of it .
46012028	And God has appointed in the church first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then workers of miracles , then those having gifts of healings , helps , administrations , and those speaking in various kinds of tongues .
46012029	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Do all work miracles ?
46012030	Do all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	But earnestly desire the greater gifts . And I will show you a still more excellent way .
46013001	If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	If I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
46013003	If I give all I have to the poor , and if I surrender my body to be burned , but have not love , I gain nothing .
46013004	Love is patient , love is kind . It is not jealous or boastful , it is not arrogant
46013005	or rude , it does not seek its own , it is not provoked , it keeps no record of wrongs ,
46013006	it does not rejoice in evil , but rejoices with the truth .
46013007	Love bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
46013008	Love never fails ; but where there are prophecies , they will cease ; where there are tongues , they will be stilled ; where there is knowledge , it will pass away .
46013009	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ;
46013010	but when the perfect comes , the partial will pass away .
46013011	When I was a child , I spoke like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child ; when I became a man , I put childish ways behind me .
46013012	For now we see in a mirror dimly , but then face to face . Now I know in part , but then I shall know fully — even as I have been fully known .
46013013	So now faith , hope , love abide , these three ; but the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Pursue love , and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts , especially that you may prophesy .
46014002	For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God ; for no one understands him , but in his spirit he speaks mysteries .
46014003	But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their edification and encouragement and comfort .
46014004	He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself , but he who prophesies edifies the church .
46014005	Now I want you all to speak in tongues , but even more that you would prophesy . He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues , unless some one interprets , so that the church may be edified .
46014006	But now , brethren , if I come to you speaking in tongues , what will I profit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching ?
46014007	If even lifeless things , such as the flute or the harp , do not give a distinction in the notes , how will any one know what is played ?
46014008	And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound , who will get ready for battle ?
46014009	So it is with you , unless you utter by the tongue speech that is intelligible , how will anyone know what is spoken ? For you will be speaking into the air .
46014010	Undoubtedly there are many languages in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
46014011	If then I do not know the meaning of the language , I will be a foreigner to the one who is speaking , and the speaker will be a foreigner to me .
46014012	So it is with you ; since you are eager for spiritual gifts , strive to excel in building up the church .
46014013	Therefore , he who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret .
46014014	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is unfruitful .
46014015	What am I to do ? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also ; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also .
46014016	Otherwise , if you bless with the spirit , how can any one in the position of an outsider say the » Amen « to your thanksgiving , since he does not know what you are saying ?
46014017	For you may be giving thanks well enough , but the other man is not edified .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all ;
46014019	but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind , to instruct others , than ten thousand words in a tongue .
46014020	Brethren , do not be children in your thinking ; be infants in evil , but in thinking be mature .
46014021	In the law it is written , » By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people , and even then they will not listen to me , says the Lord . «
46014022	Tongues , then , are a sign , not for believers but for unbelievers ; but prophecy is for believers , not for unbelievers .
46014023	Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues , and outsiders or unbelievers enter , will they not say that you are mad ?
46014024	But if all prophesy , and an unbeliever or an outsider enters , he is convicted by all , he is called to account by all ;
46014025	the secrets of his heart are disclosed ; and so , he will fall on his face , and worship God , declaring that God is really among you .
46014026	What is the outcome then , brethren ? When you come together , each one has a hymn , or a teaching , or a revelation , or a tongue , or an interpretation . Let all things be done for edification .
46014027	If anyone speaks in a tongue , it should be by two or at the most three , and each in turn ; and one must interpret .
46014028	But if there is no interpreter , he must keep silent in the church ; and let him speak to himself and to God .
46014029	Let two or three prophets speak , and let the others weigh what is said .
46014030	But if a revelation is made to another who is sitting , the first one must keep silent .
46014031	For you can all prophesy one by one , so that all may learn and all be encouraged ;
46014032	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets .
46014033	For God is not a God of confusion but of peace . As in all the churches of the saints ,
46014034	the women should keep silent in the churches . For they are not permitted to speak , but should be submissive , as even the law says .
46014035	If they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home ; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church .
46014036	Did the word of God originate with you ? Or are you the only people it has reached ?
46014037	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual , let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command .
46014038	But if anyone does not recognize this , he is not recognized .
46014039	Therefore , my brethren , desire earnestly to prophesy , and do not forbid speaking in tongues .
46014040	But all things should be done decently and in an orderly way .
46015001	Now I would remind you , brethren , of the gospel I preached to you , which you received , in which you stand ,
46015002	by which also you are saved , if you hold fast the word which I preached to you , unless you believed in vain .
46015003	For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received , that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
46015004	that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures ,
46015005	and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
46015006	After that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time , most of whom are still alive , though some have fallen asleep .
46015007	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
46015008	And last of all , as to one untimely born , he appeared to me also .
46015009	For I am the least of the apostles , and not fit to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace toward me was not in vain . No , I worked harder than all of them — yet not I , but the grace of God that was with me .
46015011	Whether then it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed .
46015012	Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead , how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , then not even Christ has been raised ;
46015014	if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain and so is your faith .
46015015	More than that , we are even found to be false witnesses of God , because we testified against God that he raised Christ , whom he did not raise , if in fact the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is futile ; you are still in your sins .
46015018	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
46015019	If for this life only we have hoped in Christ , we are of all men most to be pitied .
46015020	But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead , the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep .
46015021	For since by a man came death , by a man came also the resurrection of the dead .
46015022	For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
46015023	But each in his own order : Christ the first fruits , then , at his coming , those who belong to him .
46015024	Then comes the end , when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all rule and all authority and power .
46015025	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be destroyed is death .
46015027	» For God has put all things in subjection under his feet . « But when it says , » All things are put in subjection under him , « it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him .
46015028	When all things are subjected to him , then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
46015029	Otherwise , what will those do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why then are people baptized for them ?
46015030	Why are we also in danger every hour ?
46015031	I protest , brethren , by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die every day .
46015032	If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons , what have I gained ? If the dead are not raised , » Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . «
46015033	Do not be deceived : » Bad company corrupts good morals . «
46015034	Come back to your senses as you ought , and stop sinning ; for some have no knowledge of God . I say this to your shame .
46015035	But someone will ask , » How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body do they come ? «
46015036	You foolish man ! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
46015037	And that which you sow , you do not sow the body which is to be , but a bare grain , perhaps of wheat or of something else .
46015038	But God gives it a body as he has determined , and to each kind of seed he gives its own body .
46015039	For not all flesh is the same flesh , but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of animals , another of birds , and another of fish .
46015040	There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies ; but the glory of the heavenly is one , and the glory of the earthly is another .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for star differs from star in glory .
46015042	So is it with the resurrection of the dead . It is sown a perishable body , it is raised imperishable ;
46015043	it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
46015044	it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	So it is written , » The first man Adam became a living being « ; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
46015046	However , the spiritual is not first , but the natural ; and then the spiritual .
46015047	The first man was from the earth , of dust ; the second man is from heaven .
46015048	As was the man of dust , so are those who are of the dust ; and as is the man of heaven , so also are those who are of heaven .
46015049	Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust , we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven .
46015050	Now I tell you this , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable .
46015051	Behold , I tell you a mystery ; we will not all sleep , but we will all be changed ,
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we will be changed .
46015053	For this perishable must put on the imperishable , and this mortal must put on immortality .
46015054	When the perishable puts on the imperishable , and the mortal puts on immortality , then will come to pass the saying that is written : » Death is swallowed up in victory . «
46015055	
46015056	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
46016001	Now concerning the collection for the saints : as I directed the churches of Galatia , so you must also do .
46016002	On the first day of every week , each one of you is to put something aside and store it up , as he may prosper , so that no collections be made when I come .
46016003	And when I arrive , I will send those whom you approve with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	If it seems advisable for me to go also , they will accompany me .
46016005	But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia , for I am going through Macedonia ;
46016006	and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter , so that you may help me on my journey , wherever I go .
46016007	For I do not want to see you now just in passing ; I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord permits .
46016008	But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	for a wide door for effective work has opened to me , and there are many adversaries .
46016010	Now if Timothy comes , see that he is with you with nothing to fear , for he is doing the work of the Lord , just as I am .
46016011	So let no one despise him . Send him on his way in peace , that he may return to me ; for I am expecting him with the brethren .
46016012	As for our brother Apollos , I strongly urged him to come to you with the other brethren , but it was not at all his will to come now . He will come when he has opportunity .
46016013	Be on the your guard , stand firm in the faith , act like men , be strong .
46016014	Let all that you do be done in love .
46016015	You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia , and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints . Now I urge you , brethren ,
46016016	to be subject to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors .
46016017	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus , because they have supplied what was lacking on your part .
46016018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours also . Give recognition to such men .
46016019	The churches of Asia send you greetings . Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the lord , with the church that is in their house .
46016020	All the brethren send you greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	I , Paul , write this greeting in my own hand .
46016022	If anyone does not love the Lord — let him be accursed . Come , O Lord !
46016023	The grace of The Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
47001001	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints who are throughout Achaia :
47001002	grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort ,
47001004	who comforts us in all our affliction , so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
47001005	For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives , so also through Christ our comfort overflows .
47001006	If we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation ; and if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings that we suffer .
47001007	And our hope for you is firm , because we know that just as you share in our sufferings , so also you share in our comfort .
47001008	For we do not want you to be ignorant , brethren , of our affliction which came to us in Asia : that we were burdened beyond measure , above strength , so that we despaired even of life .
47001009	Indeed , we felt that we had received the sentence of death . But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God , who raises the dead .
47001010	He delivered us from so deadly a peril , and he will deliver us ; on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again .
47001011	You also must help us by your prayers , so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to the prayers of many .
47001012	For our boast is this : the testimony of our conscience , that with holiness and godly sincerity , not in worldly wisdom but in the grace of God , we have conducted ourselves in the world , and still more toward you .
47001013	For we write you nothing but what you can read and understand ; and I hope you will understand fully ,
47001014	as you have understood us in part , that you can be proud of us just as we can be of you , in the day of the Lord Jesus .
47001015	Because I was sure of this , I wanted to come to you first , so that you might have a double benefit .
47001016	I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia , and then to have you send me on my way to Judea .
47001017	When I was planning this , did I do it lightly ? Or do I make my plans in a fleshly manner so that in the same breath I say , » Yes , Yes « and » No , No « ?
47001018	But as surely as God is faithful , our word to you has not been Yes and No .
47001019	For the Son of God , Christ Jesus , who was preached among you by us — by me and Silvanus and Timothy — was not Yes and No , but in him it has always been Yes .
47001020	For as many as are the promises of God , in him they are Yes . And so through him we speak our Amen to the glory of God .
47001021	Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ , and has anointed us ;
47001022	he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee .
47001023	But I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth .
47001024	Not that we lord it over your faith ; but we work with you for your joy , for you stand firm in your faith .
47002001	So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you .
47002002	For if I cause you pain , who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained ?
47002003	And I wrote as I did , so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice , for I had confidence in all of you , that my joy would be the joy of you all .
47002004	For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears , not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you .
47002005	But if any one has caused pain , he has caused it not to me , but in some measure — not to put it too severely — to all of you .
47002006	Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority ,
47002007	so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him , so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
47002008	I urge you , therefore , to reaffirm your love for him .
47002009	For this is why I wrote , that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything .
47002010	Any one whom you forgive , I also forgive . What I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , has been for your sake in the presence of Christ ,
47002011	in order that Satan might gain no advantage over us ; for we are not ignorant of his schemes .
47002012	Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord ,
47002013	I still had no rest in my mind , because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who in Christ always leads us in triumph , and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere .
47002015	For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing ,
47002016	to the one a fragrance from death to death , to the other a fragrance from life to life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
47002017	For we are not , like so many , peddling the word of God ; but as men of sincerity , as from God , in the sight of God we speak in Christ .
47003001	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? Or do we need , as some do , letters of recommendation to you , or from you ?
47003002	You yourselves are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men .
47003003	You show that you are a letter from Christ , delivered by us , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of carnal hearts .
47003004	Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God .
47003005	Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from ourselves ; but our competence is from God ,
47003006	who has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant , not of the letter but of the Spirit ; for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	Now if the ministry that brought death , which was engraved in letters on stone , came with glory , so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory , fading though it was ,
47003008	will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious ?
47003009	For if the ministry of condemnation has glory , much more does the ministry of righteousness exceed it in glory .
47003010	For indeed what had glory , in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it .
47003011	For if what was fading away came with glory , much more is the glory of that which lasts .
47003012	Therefore , since we have such a hope , we are very bold .
47003013	We are not like Moses , who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of the radiance that was fading away .
47003014	But their minds were hardened ; for to this day , when they read the old covenant , the same veil remains unlifted , because only in Christ is it removed .
47003015	Even to this day when Moses is read , a veil lies over their hearts .
47003016	But whenever a person turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
47003018	And we all , with unveiled face , beholding the glory of the Lord , are being transformed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another , for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit .
47004001	Therefore , since we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we do not lose heart .
47004002	But we have renounced secret and shameful ways ; we do not use deception , nor do we distort the word of God . On the contrary , by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God .
47004003	And even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are perishing .
47004004	In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers , so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
47004005	For we do not preach ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake .
47004006	For it is the God who said , » Let light shine out of darkness , « who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us .
47004008	We are hard pressed on every side , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not in despair ;
47004009	persecuted , but not forsaken ; struck down , but not destroyed ;
47004010	always carrying about in the body the death of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body .
47004011	For we who live are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake , so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh .
47004012	So then death is at work in us , but life in you .
47004013	Since we have the same spirit of faith , according to what is written , » I believed and therefore I spoke , « we also believe and therefore speak ,
47004014	knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence .
47004015	For all this is for your benefit , so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God .
47004016	Therefore we do not lose heart . Though our outer nature is wasting away , yet our inner nature is being renewed day by day .
47004017	For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison ,
47004018	while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are unseen ; for the things which are seen are temporary , but the things which are unseen are eternal .
47005001	For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
47005002	Here indeed we groan , longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling ,
47005003	so that when we are clothed , we will not be found naked .
47005004	For while we are in this tent , we groan and are burdened , because we do not wish to be unclothed , but to be further clothed , so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
47005005	Now he who has prepared us for this very thing is God , who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee .
47005006	Therefore we are always of good courage ; and we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord ,
47005007	for we walk by faith , not by sight .
47005008	We are confident , I say , and would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord .
47005009	So whether we are at home or away , we make it our aim to please him .
47005010	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , that each one may receive the things done in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
47005011	Therefore , knowing the fear of the Lord , we persuade men ; but what we are is known to God , and I hope it is known also to your conscience .
47005012	We are not again commending ourselves to you , but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us , so that you may have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart .
47005013	For if we are beside ourselves , it is for God ; if we are in our right mind , it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Christ controls us , because we are convinced that one has died for all ; therefore all have died .
47005015	And he died for all , that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again .
47005016	From now on , therefore , we regard no one from a fleshly point of view ; even though we once regarded Christ from a fleshly point of view , we regard him thus no longer .
47005017	Therefore , if any one is in Christ , he is a new creation ; the old has passed away , behold , the new has come .
47005018	All this is from God , who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation ;
47005019	that is , God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not counting their trespasses against them , and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation .
47005020	We are therefore ambassadors for Christ , as though God were making his appeal through us . We beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
47005021	For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin , so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
47006001	Working together with him , then , we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain .
47006002	For he says , » At the acceptable time I have listened to you , and helped you on the day of salvation . « Behold , now is the acceptable time ; behold , now is the day of salvation .
47006003	We put no stumbling block in anyone's path , so that our ministry will not be discredited .
47006004	But as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way : through great endurance , in afflictions , hardships , distresses ,
47006005	in beatings , imprisonments , tumults , labors , sleeplessness , hunger ,
47006006	in purity , knowledge , patience , kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in genuine love ,
47006007	in truthful speech , and in the power of God ; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left ;
47006008	through glory and dishonor , evil report and good report ; true , yet regarded as impostors ;
47006009	as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and behold we live ; as punished , and yet not killed ;
47006010	as sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing everything .
47006011	Our mouth has spoken freely to you , O Corinthians . Our heart is opened wide .
47006012	You are not restricted by us , but you are restricted in your own affections .
47006013	Now in a fair exchange — I speak as to my children — open wide your hearts also .
47006014	Do not be yoked together with unbelievers . For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness ? Or what fellowship has light with darkness ?
47006015	What harmony has Christ with Belial ? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	What agreement has the temple of God with idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ; as God said , » I will live in them and walk among them , and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
47006017

47007001	Since we have these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
47007002	Make room for us in your hearts ; we have wronged no one , we have corrupted no one , we have taken advantage of no one .
47007003	I do not say this to condemn you , for I have said before that you are in our hearts , to die together and to live together .
47007004	I have great confidence in you ; I have great pride in you ; I am filled with comfort . With all our affliction , I am overflowing with joy .
47007005	For even when we came into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were afflicted at every turn — conflicts on the outside and fears within .
47007006	But God , who comforts the downcast , comforted us by the coming of Titus ,
47007007	and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you , as he told us of your longing , your mourning , your zeal for me , so that I rejoiced still more .
47007008	For even if I made you sorry with my letter , I do not regret it . Though I did regret it — for I see that my letter hurt you , though only for a little while —
47007009	now I rejoice , not because you were made sorry , but because your sorrow led you to repentance ; for you became sorrowful as God intended , so that you suffered no loss through us .
47007010	For godly sorrow produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret , but worldly sorrow produces death .
47007011	For behold what this very thing , godly sorrow , has produced in you : what earnestness , what eagerness to clear yourselves , what indignation , what alarm , what longing , what zeal , what readiness to see justice done ! At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter .
47007012	So although I wrote to you , it was not on account of the one who did the wrong , nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong , but in order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God .
47007013	Therefore we are comforted . And besides our own comfort , we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
47007014	For if I have boasted to him about you , I was not put to shame ; but just as everything we said to you was true , so our boasting before Titus has proved true .
47007015	And his affection goes out all the more to you , as he remembers the obedience of you all , how you received him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I rejoice , because I have perfect confidence in you .
47008001	Now , brethren , we want you to know about the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia ,
47008002	for in a severe test of affliction , their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth of their liberality .
47008003	For I testify that according to their ability , and even beyond their ability , they gave of their own free will ,
47008004	urgently pleading with us for the privilege of sharing in the relief of the saints .
47008005	And they did not do as we expected , but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God .
47008006	So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning , he would also complete in you this work of grace .
47008007	But as you excel in everything — in faith , in utterance , in knowledge , in all earnestness , and in your love for us — see that you excel in this work of grace also .
47008008	I am not speaking this as a command , but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , so that through his poverty you might become rich .
47008010	And in this matter I give my advice : it is best for you now to complete what a year ago you began not only to do but to desire .
47008011	Now finish the work , so that your readiness to do it may be matched by your completion of it , according to your means .
47008012	For if the readiness is there , it is acceptable according to what a man has , not according to what he does not have .
47008013	For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened ;
47008014	but at the present time your abundance should supply their need , so that their abundance may supply your need , that there may be equality .
47008015	As it is written , » He who gathered much had nothing left over , and he who gathered little had no lack . «
47008016	But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus .
47008017	For he not only accepted our appeal , but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord .
47008018	And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his preaching of the gospel ;
47008019	and not only that , but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work which we are carrying on , for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will .
47008020	We intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we are administering ,
47008021	for we have regard for what is honorable , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
47008022	And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many matters , but who is now more diligent than ever because of his great confidence in you .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker among you ; and as for our brethren , they are messengers of the churches , a glory to Christ .
47008024	Therefore openly before the churches , show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our boasting about you .
47009001	Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the offering for the saints ,
47009002	for I know your readiness , of which I boast about you to the Macedonians , saying that Achaia has been ready since last year ; and your zeal has stirred up most of them .
47009003	But I am sending the brethren so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this case , so that you may be ready , as I said you would be ;
47009004	lest if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we — not to say anything about you — would be ashamed of having been so confident .
47009005	So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me , and arrange in advance for this gift you have promised , so that it may be ready not as an exaction but as a willing gift .
47009006	The point is this : he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
47009007	Each one must give just as he has purposed in his heart , not reluctantly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you , so that you , always having all sufficiency in everything , may have an abundance for every good work .
47009009	As it is written , » He has scattered abroad , he gives to the poor ; his righteousness endures forever . «
47009010	Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will multiply the harvest of your righteousness .
47009011	You will be enriched in every way for great generosity , which through us will produce thanksgiving to God .
47009012	For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints , but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God .
47009013	Because of the test of this service , you will glorify God by your obedience in your confession of the gospel of Christ , and by the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others ;
47009014	while they long for you and pray for you , because of the surpassing grace of God in you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift !
47010001	I , Paul , myself urge you , by the meekness and gentleness of Christ — I who am humble when face to face with you , but bold to you when I am away ! —
47010002	I beg you that when I am present I may not have to be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some , who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
47010003	For though we live in the flesh , we do not wage war as the flesh does .
47010004	For the weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world , but they have divine power to destroy strongholds .
47010005	We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God , and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ ,
47010006	and we are ready to punish every disobedience , whenever your obedience is complete .
47010007	You look at things as they are outwardly . If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's , let him consider this again within himself , that just as he is Christ’s , so also are we .
47010008	For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority , which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you , I shall not be put to shame .
47010009	I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters .
47010010	For they say , » His letters are weighty and strong , but his personal presence is weak , and his speech of no account . «
47010011	Let such people realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent , we will be in our actions when we are present .
47010012	For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . But when they measure themselves by themselves , and compare themselves with themselves , they are without understanding .
47010013	But we will not boast beyond proper limits , but will confine our boasting to the field God has apportioned to us , a field that reaches even to you .
47010014	For we are not overextending ourselves , as if we did not reach to you ; we were the first to come even as far as you with the gospel of Christ .
47010015	We do not go beyond limits by boasting in other men’s labors , but our hope is that as your faith grows , our sphere among you may be greatly enlarged ,
47010016	so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you . For we do not want to boast of work already done in another man's territory .
47010017	But , » Let him who boasts boast in the Lord . «
47010018	For it is not he who commends himself that is approved , but he whom the Lord commends .
47011001	I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness ; but indeed you are bearing with me .
47011002	I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy ; for I betrothed you to one husband , so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin .
47011003	But I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning , your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ .
47011004	For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received , or a different gospel from the one you accepted , you put up with it easily enough .
47011005	I think that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles .
47011006	But even if I am unskilled in speech , I am not in knowledge ; in every way we have made this plain to you in all things .
47011007	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge ?
47011008	I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you .
47011009	And when I was with you and needed something , I was not a burden to anyone , for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed . I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way , and will continue to do so .
47011010	As the truth of Christ is in me , this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia .
47011011	Why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
47011012	And what I am doing , I will also continue to do , in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things of which they boast .
47011013	For such men are false apostles , deceitful workmen , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no wonder , for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light .
47011015	Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness . Their end will be according to their deeds .
47011016	I repeat , let no one think me foolish ; but even if you do , receive me as a fool , so that I too may boast a little .
47011017	What I am saying I am not saying as the Lord would , but as a fool , in this confidence of boasting .
47011018	Since many boast according to the flesh , I too will boast .
47011019	For you put up with fools gladly , being so wise yourselves !
47011020	For you put up with anyone if he makes slaves of you , or preys upon you , or takes advantage of you , or exalts himself , or strikes you in the face .
47011021	To my shame , I must say that we were too weak for that ! But whatever anyone else dares to boast about — I am speaking as a fool — I also dare to boast about .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? I am a better one — I am talking like a madman — in far more labors , in far more imprisonments , with more beatings , and often in danger of death .
47011024	Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with rods , once I was stoned , three times I was shipwrecked , a night and a day I have spent in the open sea .
47011026	I have been on frequent journeys , in danger from rivers , in danger from robbers , in danger from my own countrymen , in danger from Gentiles , in danger in the city , in danger in the wilderness , in danger at sea , and in danger from false brethren ;
47011027	I have been in labor and hardship , through many sleepless nights , in hunger and thirst , often without food , in cold and exposure .
47011028	Besides such external things , there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is made to fall , and I do not inwardly burn ?
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast of the things that show my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , he who is blessed forever , knows that I am not lying .
47011032	In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me ,
47011033	but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall , and escaped his hands .
47012001	I must go on boasting , though there is nothing to be gained by it ; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven . Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know — God knows .
47012003	And I know that this man — whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know , but God knows —
47012004	was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things , which a man is not permitted to tell .
47012005	On behalf of such a man I will boast , but on my own behalf I will not boast , except of my weaknesses .
47012006	Though if I should boast , I will not be a fool , for I will be speaking the truth . But I refrain from it , so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me .
47012007	And to keep me from being too elated because of the abundance of revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , a messenger of Satan , to harass me , to keep me from being too elated .
47012008	Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this , that it should depart from me .
47012009	But he said to me , » My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . « Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ may rest on me .
47012010	That is why , for Christ's sake , I am content in weaknesses , in insults , in hardships , in persecutions , in difficulties ; for when I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I have been a fool ! You forced me to it , for I ought to have been commended by you . For I was not in the least inferior to these super-apostles , even though I am nothing .
47012012	The signs of a true apostle were performed among you in all perseverance , with signs and wonders and mighty works .
47012013	For in what respect were you inferior to the rest of the churches , except that I myself did not become a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
47012014	Here for the third time I am ready to come to you . And I will not be a burden to you , for I seek not what is yours but you ; for children ought not to lay up for their parents , but parents for their children .
47012015	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . If I love you the more , am I to be loved the less ?
47012016	But be that as it may , I did not burden you myself . Yet , crafty fellow that I am , I caught you by trickery !
47012017	Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you ?
47012018	I urged Titus to go , and I sent the brother with him . Titus did not take advantage of you , did he ? Did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps ?
47012019	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you ? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ , and all for your upbuilding , beloved .
47012020	For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you what I wish you to be , and you may not find me what you wish me to be ; I fear that there may be quarreling , jealousy , outbursts of anger , factions , slander , gossip , arrogance and disorder .
47012021	I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you , and I will have to mourn over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity , immorality , and lewdness which they have practiced .
47013001	This is the third time I am coming to you . Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses .
47013002	I warned those who sinned in the past and all the others , and I warn them now while absent , as I did when present the second time , that if I come again I will not spare them —
47013003	since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me . He is not weak in dealing with you , but is powerful in you .
47013004	For he was crucified in weakness , yet he lives by the power of God . For we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God for you .
47013005	Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith ; test yourselves . Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you — unless , indeed , you fail the test ?
47013006	I trust that you will realize that we have not failed the test .
47013007	Now we pray to God that you may not do wrong — not that we may appear to have met the test , but that you may do what is right , even though we may seem to have failed .
47013008	For we cannot do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
47013009	For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong . What we pray for is your perfection .
47013010	I write these things while I am absent , in order that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority which the Lord gave me for building you up , and not for tearing you down .
47013011	Finally , brethren , farewell . Aim for perfection , listen to my appeal , be of one mind , live in peace . And the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All the saints greet you .
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	Paul , an apostle — sent not from men nor through man , but through Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised him from the dead —
48001002	and all the brethren who are with me , to the churches of Galatia :
48001003	grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father ,
48001005	to whom be the glory for ever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel —
48001007	which is really not another gospel ; but there are some who are disturbing you , and want to pervert the gospel of Christ .
48001008	But even if we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we preached to you , let him be accursed !
48001009	As we have said before , so I say again now , if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received , let him be accursed !
48001010	Am I now seeking the favor of men , or of God ? Or am I trying to please men ? If I were still trying to please men , I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	For I would have you know , brethren , that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man .
48001012	For I did not receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ .
48001013	For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism , how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it ;
48001014	and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people , so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers .
48001015	But when God , who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace , was pleased
48001016	to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles , I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood ,
48001017	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia ; and again I returned to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years , I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	But I saw none of the other apostles except James , the Lord's brother .
48001020	( Now in what I am writing to you , I assure you before God that I do not lie . )
48001021	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ ;
48001023	they only heard it said , » He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy . «
48001024	And they glorified God because of me .
48002001	Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus along also .
48002002	I went up because of a revelation ; and I set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles . But I did this privately to those who were of reputation , for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain .
48002003	But even Titus , who was with me , was not compelled to be circumcised , though he was a Greek .
48002004	But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in , who had slipped in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus , in order to bring us into bondage .
48002005	We did not yield to them even for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you .
48002006	And from those who were reputed to be something ( what they were makes no difference to me ; God shows no partiality ) — those , I say , who were of repute added nothing to me ;
48002007	but on the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised , just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised
48002008	( for he who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles ) ,
48002009	and when they perceived the grace that was given to me , James and Cephas and John , who were reputed to be pillars , gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised .
48002010	All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor , the very thing I was eager to do .
48002011	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he stood condemned .
48002012	For before certain men came from James , he used to eat with the Gentiles ; but when they came , he began to draw back and separate himself , fearing the party of the circumcision .
48002013	The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy , with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in the presence of them all , » If you , being a Jew , live like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ?
48002015	» We ourselves , who are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners ,
48002016	yet who know that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Christ Jesus , so that we may be justified by faith in Christ , and not by works of the law , because by works of the law will no flesh be justified .
48002017	But if , while seeking to be justified in Christ , we ourselves have also been found sinners , is Christ then an agent of sin ? Certainly not !
48002018	For if I rebuild what I destroyed , I prove myself a transgressor .
48002019	For through the law I died to the law , so that I might live to God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ ; it is no longer I who live , but Christ who lives in me ; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me .
48002021	I do not nullify the grace of God , for if righteousness comes through the Law , then Christ died for nothing . «
48003001	You foolish Galatians ! Who has bewitched you , before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified ?
48003002	This is the only thing I want to find out from you : did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law , or by hearing with faith ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? Having begun with the Spirit , are you now being perfected by the flesh ?
48003004	Did you suffer so many things in vain — if it really was in vain ?
48003005	Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law , or by hearing with faith ?
48003006	Even so Abraham » believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness . «
48003007	Therefore , be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham .
48003008	And the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham , saying , » In you will all the nations be blessed . «
48003009	So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham , the man of faith .
48003010	For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse ; for it is written , » Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law , to do them . «
48003011	Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident ; for , » The righteous man shall live by faith . «
48003012	But the Law is not of faith ; on the contrary , » He who does them shall live by them . «
48003013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law , having become a curse for us — for it is written , » Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree « —
48003014	in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles , so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
48003015	To give a human example , brethren : even though it is only a man's covenant , yet when it has been ratified , no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it .
48003016	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . He does not say , » And to seeds , « as referring to many , but rather to one , » And to your seed , « that is , Christ .
48003017	What I mean is this : the Law , which came four hundred and thirty years later , does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God , so as to nullify the promise .
48003018	For if the inheritance is based on the law , it is no longer based on a promise ; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise .
48003019	Why the Law then ? It was added because of transgressions , having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator , until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made .
48003020	Now a mediator does not represent just one party ; but God is one .
48003021	Is the law then opposed to the promises of God ? Certainly not ! For if a law had been given which could impart life , then righteousness would indeed have come by the law .
48003022	But the Scripture has bound everyone under sin , so that that what was promised by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
48003023	Now before faith came , we were bound under the law , kept under restraint until faith should be revealed .
48003024	So the law was our tutor to lead us to Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
48003025	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a tutor .
48003026	For you are all sons of God , through faith in Christ Jesus .
48003027	For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is neither male nor female ; for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	And if you belong to Christ , then you are Abraham's offspring , heirs according to promise .
48004001	I mean that the heir , as long as he is a child , is no different from a slave , although he is the owner of all the estate ;
48004002	but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father .
48004003	So also , when we were children , we were in slavery under the elemental things of the world .
48004004	But when the time had fully come , God sent forth his Son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
48004005	to redeem those who were under the law , so that we might receive adoption as sons .
48004006	Because you are sons , God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , » Abba ! Father ! «
48004007	So you are no longer a slave , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir through God .
48004008	Formerly , when you did not know God , you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods .
48004009	But now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things ? Do you desire to be enslaved all over again ?
48004010	You observe days and months and seasons and years !
48004011	I fear for you , that perhaps I have labored over you in vain .
48004012	Brethren , I beg you , become as I am , for I also have become as you are . You have done me no wrong ;
48004013	you know it was because of an illness in the flesh that I preached the gospel to you at first ;
48004014	and though my fleshly condition was a trial to you , you did not despise or scorn me , but you received me as an angel of God , as Christ Jesus himself .
48004015	What has become of the satisfaction you felt ? For I bear you witness that , if possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
48004016	Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	They seek you , but for no good purpose ; they want to shut you out , so that you may seek them .
48004018	But it is always good to seek a good purpose , and not only when I am present with you .
48004019	My children , with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you —
48004020	I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
48004021	Tell me , you who want to be under law , do you not listen to the law ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave and one by the free woman .
48004023	But the son by the slave was born according to the flesh , and the son by the free woman through the promise .
48004024	This is allegorically speaking , for these women are two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves ; she is Hagar .
48004025	Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem above is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written , » Rejoice , O barren woman who does not bear ; break forth and shout , you who are not in labor ; for the children of the desolate are more numerous than the children of her who has a husband . «
48004028	Now you , brethren , like Isaac , are children of promise .
48004029	But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so it is now .
48004030	But what does the scripture say ? » Cast out the slave and her son , for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman . «
48004031	So then , brethren , we are not children of the slave , but of the free woman .
48005001	It was for freedom that Christ has set us free ; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery .
48005002	Behold I , Paul , say to you that if you receive circumcision , Christ will be of no benefit to you .
48005003	I testify again to every man who receives circumcision , that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law .
48005004	You have been severed from Christ , you who are seeking to be justified by law ; you have fallen away from grace .
48005005	For through the Spirit , by faith , we wait for the hope of righteousness .
48005006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail , but faith working through love .
48005007	You were running well ; who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	This persuasion did not come from him who calls you .
48005009	A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough .
48005010	I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine ; and the one who is troubling you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
48005011	But if I , brethren , still preach circumcision , why am I still persecuted ? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished .
48005012	I wish that those who are troubling you would mutilate themselves !
48005013	For you were called to freedom , brethren ; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh , but through love serve one another .
48005014	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word , » You shall love your neighbor as yourself . «
48005015	But if you bite and devour one another , take care that you are not consumed by one another .
48005016	But I say , walk by the Spirit , and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit , and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh ; for these are opposed to each other , so that you may not do what you would .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the Law .
48005019	Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious : immorality , impurity , lewdness ,
48005020	idolatry , sorcery , hatred , strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , disputes , dissensions , factions ,
48005021	envy , drunkenness , carousing , and the like . I warn you , as I warned you before , that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , self-control ; against such things there is no law .
48005024	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
48005025	If we live by the Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become conceited , provoking one another , envying one another .
48006001	Brethren , even if anyone is caught in a trespass , you who are spiritual , restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; each one looking to yourself , so that you too will not be tempted .
48006002	Bear one another's burdens , and so fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
48006004	But let each one test his own work , and then he will have reason to boast in himself alone , and not in his neighbor .
48006005	For each one will bear his own load .
48006006	Let the one who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches .
48006007	Do not be deceived ; God is not mocked , for whatever a man sows , that he will also reap .
48006008	For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption ; but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
48006009	Let us not lose heart in doing good , for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary .
48006010	So then , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , and especially to those who are of the household of faith .
48006011	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand .
48006012	Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised , and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48006013	For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves , but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh .
48006014	But may it never be that I would boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
48006015	For neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but what counts is a new creation .
48006016	Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule , upon the Israel of God .
48006017	From now on let no one cause me trouble , for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brethren . Amen .
49001001	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints who are in Ephesus and faithful in Christ Jesus :
49001002	grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ,
49001004	just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and blameless before him . In love
49001005	he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
49001006	to the praise of his glorious grace , which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved .
49001007	In him we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace
49001008	which he lavished on us . In all wisdom and insight
49001009	he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure , which he purposed in Christ ,
49001010	as a plan for the fullness of the times , to unite all things in Christ , things in heaven and things on earth . In him
49001011	also we have obtained an inheritance , having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ,
49001012	in order that we , who were the first to hope in Christ , would be for the praise of his glory .
49001013	In him , you also have heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation . Having also believed , you were sealed in him with the promised Holy Spirit ,
49001014	who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance , until the redemption of those who are God's possession — to the praise of his glory .
49001015	For this reason , ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints ,
49001016	I do not cease giving thanks for you , remembering you in my prayers ,
49001017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him .
49001018	I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened , so that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you , what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints ,
49001019	and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe . These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might
49001020	which he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places ,
49001021	far above all rule and authority and power and dominion , and above every name that is named , not only in this age but also in the one to come .
49001022	And he put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things for the church ,
49001023	which is his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all .
49002001	And you were dead in your trespasses and sins ,
49002002	in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience .
49002003	Among them we all once lived in the lusts of our flesh , following the desires of flesh and mind , and so we were by nature children of wrath , like the rest of mankind .
49002004	But God , who is rich in mercy , because of his great love with which he loved us ,
49002005	even when we were dead in our transgressions , made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved ) ,
49002006	and raised us up with him , and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
49002007	so that in the coming ages he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For by grace you have been saved through faith ; and this is not of yourselves , it is the gift of God —
49002009	not as a result of works , so that no one may boast .
49002010	For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared beforehand , that we would walk in them .
49002011	Therefore remember that formerly you , the Gentiles in the flesh , who are called » Uncircumcision « by the so-called » Circumcision , « which is performed in the flesh by human hands —
49002012	remember that you were at that time separate from Christ , excluded from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he himself is our peace , who has made us both one and has broken down the barrier , the dividing wall of hostility ,
49002015	by abolishing in his flesh the hostility , which is the Law of commandments and ordinances , so that he might create in himself one new man out of the two , thus making peace ,
49002016	and might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross , by which he put to death the hostility .
49002017	And he came and preached peace to you who were far away , and peace to those who were near ;
49002018	for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father .
49002019	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens , but you are fellow citizens with the saints , and are members of God's household ,
49002020	having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone ,
49002021	in whom the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord ;
49002022	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit .
49003001	For this reason I , Paul , am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles —
49003002	assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you ,
49003003	that is , the mystery made known to me by revelation , as I have already written briefly .
49003004	When you read this , you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ ,
49003005	which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ;
49003006	that is , how the Gentiles are fellow heirs and members of the same body , and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel .
49003007	Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace which was given me by the working of his power .
49003008	To me , though I am the very least of all the saints , this grace was given , to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
49003009	and to make plain to everyone the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things ;
49003010	so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places .
49003011	This was according to the eternal purpose which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
49003012	in whom we have boldness and confidence of access through our faith in him .
49003013	Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations for you , which are your glory .
49003014	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father ,
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name ,
49003016	that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man ,
49003017	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith ; and that you , being rooted and grounded in love ,
49003018	may have power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth ,
49003019	and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge , that you may be filled with all the fullness of God .
49003020	Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think , according to the power that works within us ,
49003021	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations , for ever and ever . Amen .
49004001	I therefore , a prisoner for the Lord , beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called ,
49004002	with all humility and gentleness , with patience , showing tolerance for one another in love ,
49004003	being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call ,
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
49004007	But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift .
49004008	Therefore it says , » When he ascended on high , he led a host of captives , and he gave gifts to men . «
49004009	( In saying , » He ascended , « what does it mean except that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
49004010	He who descended is also he who ascended far above all the heavens , so that he might fill all things . )
49004011	And he gave some to be apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , some pastors and teachers ,
49004012	to equip the saints for the work of service , for the building up of the body of Christ ;
49004013	until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to become mature , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ .
49004014	As a result , we are no longer to be children , tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine , by the cunning of men , by their craftiness in deceitful scheming .
49004015	But speaking the truth in love , we are to grow up in all aspects into him , who is the head , into Christ ,
49004016	from whom the whole body , being joined and held together by what every joint supplies , according to the proper working of each part , causes the growth of the body and builds itself up in love .
49004017	Now this I affirm and testify in the Lord , that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do , in the futility of their minds ,
49004018	they are darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them , due to the hardness of their heart ;
49004019	and they , having become callous , have given themselves over to sensuality , greedy for the practice of every kind of impurity .
49004020	But you did not learn Christ in this way ,
49004021	assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him , as the truth is in Jesus .
49004022	You were taught , with regard to your former manner of life , to put off your old self , which is being corrupted by its deceitful lusts ;
49004023	and be renewed in the spirit of your minds ,
49004024	and put on the new nature , created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness .
49004025	Therefore , laying aside falsehood , each one of you must speak truth with his neighbor , for we are members of one another .
49004026	Be angry , and yet do not sin ; do not let the sun go down on your anger ,
49004027	and do not give the devil an opportunity .
49004028	He who has been stealing must steal no longer , but rather must labor , doing useful work with his own hands , so that he may have something to share with those in need .
49004029	Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths , but only such as is good for building others up according to the need of the moment , that it may impart grace to those who hear .
49004030	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you , along with all malice .
49004032	Be kind and tenderhearted to one another , forgiving each other , just as in Christ God forgave you .
49005001	Therefore be imitators of God , as beloved children ;
49005002	and walk in love , just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God .
49005003	But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you , as is proper among saints .
49005004	And there must be no filthiness and silly talk , or coarse jesting , which are not fitting , but rather let there be thanksgiving .
49005005	For of this you can be sure , that no immoral , impure , or covetous person — such a man is an idolater — has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
49005006	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
49005007	Therefore do not be partners with them ;
49005008	for once you were darkness , but now you are light in the Lord ; walk as children of light
49005009	( for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
49005010	and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord .
49005011	Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness , but instead expose them .
49005012	For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret .
49005013	But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light , for everything that becomes visible is light .
49005014	For this reason it is said , » Awake , O sleeper , and arise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . «
49005015	Be careful , then , how you walk , not as unwise men , but as wise ,
49005016	making the most of your time , because the days are evil .
49005017	Therefore do not be foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
49005018	And do not get drunk with wine , for that is debauchery ; but be filled with the Spirit ,
49005019	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord ,
49005020	always giving thanks to God the Father for everything , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49005021	Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ .
49005022	Wives , be subject to your husbands , as to the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church , his body , of which he is himself the Savior .
49005024	As the church is subject to Christ , so let wives also be subject to their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her ,
49005026	that he might sanctify her , having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word ,
49005027	that he might present the church to himself in all her glory , without spot or wrinkle or any such thing , that she might be holy and blameless .
49005028	So husbands ought also to love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	For no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as Christ also does the church ,
49005030	because we are members of his body .
49005031	» For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh . «
49005032	This is a profound mystery ; but I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church .
49005033	However , each one of you must also love his wife as himself , and the wife must see that she respects her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right .
49006002	» Honor your father and mother « ( which is the first commandment with a promise ) ,
49006003	» that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth . «
49006004	Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in sincerity of heart , as to Christ ;
49006006	not in the way of eye-service , as men-pleasers , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart .
49006007	Render service with good will , as to the Lord , and not to men ,
49006008	knowing that whatever good thing each one does , this he will receive back from the Lord , whether he is a slave or free .
49006009	Masters , do the same to them , and give up threatening , knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and that there is no partiality with him .
49006010	Finally , be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might .
49006011	Put on the full armor of God , so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil .
49006012	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the powers , against the world forces of this darkness , against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places .
49006013	Therefore , take up the full armor of God , so that you may be able to resist in the evil day , and having done everything , to stand firm .
49006014	Stand firm therefore , having girded your loins with truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
49006015	and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
49006016	in addition to all this , taking up the shield of faith , with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
49006017	And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the spirit , which is the word of God .
49006018	Pray at all times in the Spirit , with all prayer and petition . And with this in view , keep alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints ,
49006019	and also pray for me , that in the opening of my mouth , utterance may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel ,
49006020	for which I am an ambassador in chains ; that I may declare it boldly , as I ought to speak .
49006021	Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , will tell you everything , so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing .
49006022	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are , and that he may encourage your hearts .
49006023	Peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus , to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the overseers and deacons :
50001002	grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you ,
50001004	always making my prayer with joy in every prayer of mine for you all ,
50001005	because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now .
50001006	For I am confident of this , that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus .
50001007	For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all , because I have you in my heart , since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel , you all are partakers of grace with me .
50001008	For God is my witness , how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus .
50001009	And this is my prayer , that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment ,
50001010	so that you may approve what is excellent , and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ ;
50001011	having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	Now I want you to know , brethren , that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel ,
50001013	so that my imprisonment for Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else ,
50001014	and that most of the brethren , trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment , have been encouraged to speak the word of God without fear .
50001015	Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry , but others from good will .
50001016	The latter do it out of love , knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel ;
50001017	the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition , not sincerely , but thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment .
50001018	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed ; and in this I rejoice . Yes , and I will rejoice ,
50001019	for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance ,
50001020	as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in anything , but that with full courage now as always Christ will be exalted in my body , whether by life or by death .
50001021	For to me , to live is Christ and to die is gain .
50001022	But if I am to live on in the flesh , this will mean fruitful labor for me . Yet which I shall choose I do not know .
50001023	I am hard pressed between the two . My desire is to depart and be with Christ , for that is far better ;
50001024	but to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake .
50001025	Convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
50001026	so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again .
50001027	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or remain absent , I will hear of you that you stand firm in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ,
50001028	in no way frightened by your opponents . This is a sign of destruction to them , but of salvation for you – and that too , from God .
50001029	For to you it has been granted for the sake of Christ , not only to believe in him , but also to suffer for his sake ,
50001030	having the same conflict which you saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
50002001	Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ , if there is any consolation of love , if there is any fellowship of the Spirit , if any affection and compassion ,
50002002	make my joy complete by being of the same mind , having the same love , being one in spirit and purpose .
50002003	Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit , but in humility consider others better than yourselves .
50002004	Each of you should look not only to your own interests , but also to the interests of others .
50002005	Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus ,
50002006	who , though he was in the form of God , did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped ,
50002007	but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being made in the likeness of men .
50002008	And being found in appearance as a man , he humbled himself and became obedient to deatheven death on a cross .
50002009	Therefore God also highly exalted him , and bestowed on him the name which is above every name ,
50002010	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
50002011	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	Therefore , my beloved , as you have always obeyed , so now , not only as in my presence but much more in my absence , work out your salvation with fear and trembling ;
50002013	for it is God who is at work in you , both to will and to work for his good pleasure .
50002014	Do all things without grumbling or arguing ,
50002015	so that you may be blameless and innocent , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , among whom you shine as lights in the world ,
50002016	holding fast the word of life , so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain .
50002017	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I am glad and rejoice with you all .
50002018	So you too should be glad and rejoice with me .
50002019	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered when I receive news of you .
50002020	I have no one else like him , who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare .
50002021	For they all seek after their own interests , not those of Christ Jesus .
50002022	But you know that he has proved his worth , because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel .
50002023	Therefore I hope to send him immediately , as soon as I see how things go with me ;
50002024	and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also .
50002025	But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier , who is also your messenger and minister to my need ;
50002026	for he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was ill .
50002027	Indeed he was ill , near to death . But God had mercy on him , and not only on him but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
50002028	Therefore I am all the more eager to send him , so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may have less anxiety .
50002029	So receive him in the Lord with all joy ; and honor men like him ,
50002030	because he almost died for the work of Christ , risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me .
50003001	Finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you again is no trouble to me , and it is a safeguard for you .
50003002	Watch out for the dogs , watch out for the evil workers , watch out for those mutilators of the body .
50003003	For we are the true circumcision , who worship in the Spirit of God , and glory in Christ Jesus , and put no confidence in the flesh ,
50003004	though I myself have reasons for confidence in the flesh . If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh , I have more :
50003005	circumcised on the eighth day , of the people of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; as to the law , a Pharisee ;
50003006	as to zeal , a persecutor of the church ; as to righteousness under the law , blameless .
50003007	But whatever was gain to me , I counted as loss for the sake of Christ .
50003008	More than that , I count everything to be loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things , and count them as rubbish , in order that I may gain Christ
50003009	and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law , but that which is through faith in Christthe righteousness that comes from God and is by faith ,
50003010	that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming like him in his death ;
50003011	in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead .
50003012	Not that I have already obtained this , or have already been made perfect , but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me .
50003013	Brethren , I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it ; but one thing I do : forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead ,
50003014	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Let those of us who are mature have this attitude ; and if in anything you have a different attitude , God will reveal that also to you .
50003016	Only let us live up to what we have already attained .
50003017	Brethren , join in following my example , and observe those who live according to the pattern you have in us .
50003018	For many , of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears , live as enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	Their end is destruction , their god is the belly , and they glory in their shame , with minds set on earthly things .
50003020	But our citizenship is in heaven , from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ;
50003021	who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body , by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself .
50004001	Therefore , my brethren , whom I love and long for , my joy and crown , stand firm thus in the Lord , my beloved .
50004002	I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , and I ask you also , true yoke-fellow , to help these women who have struggled at my side in the cause of the gospel , together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I will say , Rejoice !
50004005	Let your gentle spirit be known to all men . The Lord is near .
50004006	Do not be anxious about anything , but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God .
50004007	And the peace of God , which passes all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Finally , brethren , whatever is true , whatever is honorable , whatever is right , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is gracious , if there is any excellence , if there is anything worthy of praise , think about these things .
50004009	Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me , and the God of peace will be with you .
50004010	I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at last you have revived your concern for me ; indeed , you were concerned before , but you had no opportunity .
50004011	Not that I speak from want , for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am .
50004012	I know how to be in need , and I also know how to have plenty ; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry , both of having abundance and want .
50004013	I can do all things through him who strengthens me .
50004014	Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles .
50004015	You yourselves also know , Philippians , that in the first preaching of the gospel , when I left Macedonia , no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only ;
50004016	for even in Thessalonica you sent me a gift once and again for my needs .
50004017	Not that I seek the gift itself , but I seek for the profit which increases to your account .
50004018	I have received full payment and even more ; I am amply supplied , having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent , a fragrant offering , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
50004019	And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren who are with me greet you .
50004022	All the saints greet you , especially those of Caesar's household .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
51001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae : grace to you and peace from God our Father .
51001003	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you ,
51001004	because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints ,
51001005	because of the hope laid up for you in heaven . Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth , the gospel
51001006	which has come to you , just as in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing , even as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth ;
51001007	as you learned it from Epaphras , our beloved fellow servant , who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf ,
51001008	and who also told us of your love in the Spirit .
51001009	For this reason also , since the day we heard it , we have not ceased to pray for you , asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
51001010	so that you will live a life worthy of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God .
51001011	May you be strengthened with all power , according to his glorious might , for all endurance and patience with joy ,
51001012	giving thanks to the Father , who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light .
51001013	For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins .
51001015	He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn over all creation .
51001016	For by him all things were created , in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities — all things were created through him and for him .
51001017	He is before all things , and in him all things hold together .
51001018	And he is the head of the body , the church ; he is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , so that he might have the first place in everything .
51001019	For all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell in him
51001020	and through him , to reconcile to himself all things , whether things on earth or things in heaven , by making peace through the blood of his cross .
51001021	And although you were once alienated and hostile in mind , doing evil deeds ,
51001022	yet he has now reconciled you in his fleshly body through death , in order to present you before him holy and blameless and beyond reproach —
51001023	if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast , and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard , which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven , and of which I , Paul , have become a minister .
51001024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh I do my share for the sake of his body , which is the church , in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions .
51001025	Of this church I became a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you , to make the word of God fully known ,
51001026	the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations , but is now disclosed to the saints .
51001027	To them God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory .
51001028	We proclaim him , admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom , so that we may present every man complete in Christ .
51001029	For this end I labor , striving with all his energy , which so mightily works within me .
51002001	For I want you to know how greatly I strive for you , and for those at Laodicea , and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh ,
51002002	that their hearts may be encouraged as they are knit together in love , to have all the riches of assured understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery , that is , Christ himself ,
51002003	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	I say this so that no one may delude you with fine-sounding arguments .
51002005	For even though I am absent in flesh , nevertheless I am with you in spirit , rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ .
51002006	Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord , so live in him ,
51002007	rooted and built up in him and established in the faith , just as you were taught , overflowing with thanksgiving .
51002008	See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception , according to human tradition , according to the elementary principles of the world , rather than according to Christ .
51002009	For in him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form ,
51002010	and you have been made complete in him , who is the head over all rule and authority .
51002011	In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands , by putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ ;
51002012	having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
51002013	When you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , God made you alive together with him , having forgiven us all our sins ,
51002014	having canceled the certificate of debt , which stood against us with its decrees . He took what was hostile away from us , nailing it to the cross .
51002015	And having disarmed the powers and authorities , he made a public spectacle of them , triumphing over them through him .
51002016	Therefore let no one judge you in questions of food or drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day .
51002017	These things are only a shadow of what is to come ; but the substance belongs to Christ .
51002018	Let no one disqualify you for the prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels , taking his stand on visions he has seen , puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind ,
51002019	and not holding fast to the head , from whom the whole body , nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments , grows with a growth that is from God .
51002020	If with Christ you died to the elementary principles of the world , why , as if you still belonged to it , do you submit to regulations such as ,
51002021	» Do not handle , do not taste , do not touch ! «
51002022	( referring to things which are all destined perish with use ) , according to human commandments and teachings ?
51002023	These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body , but they are of no value against fleshly indulgence .
51003001	If then you have been raised with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God .
51003002	Set your minds on the things above , not on things that are on earth .
51003003	For you have died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , who is our life , appears , then you also will appear with him in glory .
51003005	Put to death , therefore , whatever belongs to your earthly nature : sexual immorality , impurity , passion , evil desire and greed , which is idolatry .
51003006	Because of these , the wrath of God is coming .
51003007	In these you once walked , when you lived in them .
51003008	But now you must put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and filthy language from your mouth .
51003009	Do not lie to one another , since you have put off the old self with its practices
51003010	and have put on the new self , which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator .
51003011	Here there is no Greek and Jew , circumcised and uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave and free , but Christ is all , and in all .
51003012	So , as God's chosen ones , holy and beloved , put on a heart of compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness and patience ;
51003013	bearing with one another and , if one has a complaint against another , forgiving each other ; as the Lord forgave you , so you also must forgive .
51003014	And over all these virtues put on love , which binds them all together in perfect unity .
51003015	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts , to which indeed you were called in the one body . And be thankful .
51003016	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly , teach and admonish one another with all wisdom , and sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
51003017	And whatever you do , in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , be subject to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not be harsh with them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this pleases the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not provoke your children , or they will become discouraged .
51003022	Slaves , in everything obey those who are your masters according to the flesh , not with eye-service , as men-pleasers , but in sincerity of heart , fearing the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , do your work heartily , as for the Lord and not for men ,
51003024	knowing that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward . It is the Lord Christ you are serving .
51003025	For he who does wrong will be paid back for the wrong he has done , and there is no partiality .
51004001	Masters , provide your slaves with what is right and fair , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Devote yourselves to prayer , being watchful in it with thanksgiving .
51004003	And pray for us as well , that God may open a door to us for the word , so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ , for which I am in chains ,
51004004	so that I may make it clear , as I ought to speak .
51004005	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders , making the most of the opportunity .
51004006	Let your speech always be full of grace , seasoned with salt , so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone .
51004007	Tychicus will tell you all about my affairs . He is a beloved brother , a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord .
51004008	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts ;
51004009	and with him Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of yourselves . They will tell you everything that has taken place here .
51004010	My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings , and also Mark , the cousin of Barnabas ( about whom you have received instructions ; if he comes to you , welcome him . )
51004011	and also Jesus who is called Justus . These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God , and they have proved to be a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of your number , a servant of Jesus Christ , sends you his greetings , always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers , that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God .
51004013	I testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas send you greetings .
51004015	Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea , and to Nympha and the church in her house .
51004016	When this letter has been read among you , have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans ; and see that you read the letter from Laodicea .
51004017	Say to Archippus , » See to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you may fulfill it . «
51004018	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . Remember my chains . Grace be with you .
52001001	Paul , Silvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace and peace to you .
52001002	We give thanks to God always for all of you , mentioning you in our prayers ;
52001003	remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
52001004	For we know , brethren beloved by God , that he has chosen you ;
52001005	for our gospel came to you not only in word , but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction . You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake .
52001006	You became imitators of us and of the Lord , for you received the word in much affliction , with the joy of the Holy Spirit ;
52001007	so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia .
52001008	For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia , but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere , so that we have no need to say anything .
52001009	For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you , and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God ,
52001010	and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead — Jesus , who rescues us from the wrath to come .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brethren , that our visit to you was not in vain ;
52002002	but after we had already suffered and been shamefully treated in Philippi , as you know , we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the face of great opposition .
52002003	For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity , nor is it made with deceit ;
52002004	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel , so we speak , not to please men , but to please God who tests our hearts .
52002005	For , as you know , we never used flattery nor a pretext for greed — God is witness —
52002006	nor did we seek glory from men , either from you or from others , though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ .
52002007	But we were gentle among you , like a mother nursing her little children .
52002008	Having so fond an affection for you , we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives , because you had become very dear to us .
52002009	For you remember our labor and toil , brethren ; we worked night and day , that we might not be a burden to any of you , while we preached to you the gospel of God .
52002010	You are witnesses , and God also , how holy and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers ;
52002011	for you know how , as a father with his own children , we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you
52002012	to live a life worthy of God , who calls you into his own kingdom and glory .
52002013	And we also thank God constantly for this , that when you received the word of God which you heard from us , you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is , the word of God , which is at work in you who believe .
52002014	For you , brethren , became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea , for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews ,
52002015	who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and also drove us out . They displease God and are hostile to all men ,
52002016	hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved ; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins . But wrath has come upon them at last .
52002017	But since we were taken away from you , brethren , for a short time , in person not in heart , we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face .
52002018	For we wanted to come to you — I , Paul , again and again — but Satan hindered us .
52002019	For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation ? Is it not even you , in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming ?
52002020	For you are our glory and joy .
52003001	Therefore when we could endure it no longer , we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone ,
52003002	and we sent Timothy , our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you in your faith ,
52003003	so that no one would be unsettled by these afflictions . You yourselves know that we have been destined for this .
52003004	For indeed when we were with you , we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction ; and so it came to pass , as you know .
52003005	For this reason , when I could endure it no longer , I also sent to find out about your faith , for fear that the tempter might have tempted you , and our labor would be in vain .
52003006	But now that Timothy has come to us from you , and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us , just as we long to see you —
52003007	for this reason , brethren , in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith ;
52003008	for now we really live , if you stand firm in the Lord .
52003009	For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you in return for all the joy which we feel for your sake before our God ,
52003010	as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith ?
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus , direct our way to you ;
52003012	and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all , just as we do for you ,
52003013	so that he may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
52004001	Finally , brethren , we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus , that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God , just as you are doing , you do so more and more .
52004002	For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is the will of God , your sanctification : that is , that you should abstain from sexual immorality ;
52004004	that each one of you know how to take his own spouse for himself in holiness and honor ,
52004005	not in the passion of lust like the heathen , who do not know God ;
52004006	and that no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things , just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you .
52004007	For God has not called us to impurity , but to holiness .
52004008	Therefore , he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God , who gives you his Holy Spirit .
52004009	Now concerning love of the brethren you have no need to have any one write to you , for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another ;
52004010	and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia . But we urge you , brethren , to do so more and more .
52004011	Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , to mind your own business and to work with your hands , just as we told you ,
52004012	so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anyone .
52004013	But we do not want you to be ignorant , brethren , about those who are asleep , so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope .
52004014	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus .
52004015	For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will not precede those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven , with a loud command , with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God , and the dead in Christ will rise first .
52004017	Then we who are alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air , and so we shall always be with the Lord .
52004018	Therefore comfort one another with these words .
52005001	Now as to the times and the seasons , brethren , you have no need to have anything written to you .
52005002	For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .
52005003	While people are saying , » Peace and safety , « then destruction will come upon them suddenly as labor pains upon a woman with child , and they will not escape .
52005004	But you , brethren , are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief .
52005005	For you are all sons of light and sons of the day ; we are not of the night or of darkness .
52005006	So then let us not sleep , as others do , but let us be alert and sober .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep at night ; and those who get drunk , get drunk at night .
52005008	But , since we belong to the day , let us be sober , and put on the breastplate of faith and love , and as a helmet the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God has not destined us to wrath , but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52005010	who died for us , so that whether we are awake or asleep , we will live together with him .
52005011	Therefore encourage one another and build up one another , just as you also are doing .
52005012	But we ask you , brethren , to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you ,
52005013	and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work . Live in peace with one another .
52005014	And we urge you , brethren , admonish the idlers , encourage the fainthearted , help the weak , be patient with everyone .
52005015	See that none of you repays evil for evil , but always seek to do good to one another and to all .
52005016	Rejoice always ,
52005017	pray without ceasing ,
52005018	give thanks in all circumstances ; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus .
52005019	Do not quench the Spirit ;
52005020	do not despise prophecies .
52005021	But test everything ; hold fast to what is good .
52005022	Abstain from every form of evil .
52005023	Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely ; and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	He who calls you is faithful , and he will do it .
52005025	Brethren , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss .
52005027	I charge you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	Paul , Silvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	We ought to give thanks to God always for you , brethren , as is fitting , because your faith is growing abundantly , and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing .
53001004	Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you are enduring .
53001005	This is evidence of God's righteous judgment , so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God , for which indeed you are suffering .
53001006	For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
53001007	and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire ,
53001008	inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power ,
53001010	when he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day , and to be marveled at among all who have believed — because our testimony to you was believed .
53001011	To this end we always pray for you , that our God may count you worthy of his calling , and may fulfill every good resolve and work of faith by his power ,
53001012	so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him , we beg you , brethren ,
53002002	not to be quickly shaken in mind or excited , either by spirit or by word , or by letter as if from us , to the effect that the day of the Lord has come .
53002003	Let no one deceive you in any way ; for that day will not come , unless the rebellion comes first , and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the son of destruction ,
53002004	who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship , so that he takes his seat in the temple of God , proclaiming himself to be God .
53002005	Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things ?
53002006	And you know what restrains him now , so that in his time he may be revealed .
53002007	For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work ; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way .
53002008	And then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming .
53002009	The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders ,
53002010	and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are to perish , because they refused to love the truth and so be saved .
53002011	For this reason God sends upon them a strong delusion so that they will believe what is false ,
53002012	so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in wickedness .
53002013	But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you , brethren beloved by the Lord , because God chose you from the beginning to be saved , through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth .
53002014	He called you to this through our gospel , that you may share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So then , brethren , stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught , whether by word of mouth or by letter from us .
53002016	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father , who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope by grace ,
53002017	comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word .
53003001	Finally , brethren , pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored , just as it did also with you ,
53003002	and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men ; for not all have faith .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful , and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one .
53003004	And we have confidence in the Lord about you , that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we command .
53003005	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ .
53003006	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you keep away from every brother who is living in idleness and not according to the tradition which you received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example . We were not idle when we were with you ,
53003008	nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it , but with labor and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you .
53003009	We did this , not because we do not have the right to such help , but in order to make ourselves an example for you to follow .
53003010	For even when we were with you , we gave you this rule : » If anyone will not work , he shall not eat . «
53003011	For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life , not doing any work at all , but acting like busybodies .
53003012	Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and earn their own bread to eat .
53003013	But as for you , brethren , do not grow weary of doing good .
53003014	If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter , take special note of that person and do not associate with him , so that he may be ashamed .
53003015	Yet do not regard him as an enemy , but warn him as a brother .
53003016	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way . The Lord be with you all .
53003017	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . This is a distinguishing mark in every letter ; this is the way I write .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope ,
54001002	to Timothy , my true child in the faith : grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	As I urged you when I went into Macedonia , remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines ,
54001004	nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies . These promote controversies rather than the divine training — which is by faith .
54001005	But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .
54001006	For some men have wandered away from these things and turned aside to fruitless discussion ,
54001007	wanting to be teachers of the Law , even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions .
54001008	But we know that the Law is good , if one uses it lawfully ,
54001009	realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person , but for those who are lawless and rebellious , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers
54001010	and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine ,
54001011	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , with which I have been entrusted .
54001012	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me strength , because he considered me faithful , appointing me to his service .
54001013	Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor , I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief ;
54001014	and the grace of our Lord was overflowing for me , with the faith and love that are found in Christ Jesus .
54001015	It is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners — of whom I am the foremost .
54001016	But I received mercy for this reason , so that in me , as the foremost , Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life .
54001017	Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
54001018	I give you this command , Timothy , my son , in accordance with the prophecies once made about you , that by them you may fight the good fight ,
54001019	holding faith and a good conscience , which some have rejected and made shipwreck of their faith .
54001020	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have handed over to Satan so that they will be taught not to blaspheme .
54002001	First of all , then , I urge that requests , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be made for all men ,
54002002	for kings and all who are in authority , so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity .
54002003	This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior ,
54002004	who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God , and one mediator also between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a ransom for all — the testimony given at the proper time .
54002007	For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth , I am not lying ) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
54002008	Therefore I want the men in every place to pray , lifting up holy hands , without anger or quarreling .
54002009	I also want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing , modestly and sensibly , not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly garments ,
54002010	but with good deeds , as is proper for women who profess godliness .
54002011	Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness .
54002012	I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man ; she must be silent .
54002013	For Adam was formed first , then Eve .
54002014	And it was not Adam who was deceived , but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor .
54002015	But women will be saved through the bearing of children , if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-restraint .
54003001	It is a trustworthy saying : if any one aspires to the office of overseer , he desires a noble task .
54003002	Now the overseer must be above reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate , self-controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach ,
54003003	not given to drunkenness , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money .
54003004	He must manage his own household well , keeping his children under control with all dignity
54003005	( If a man does not know how to manage his own household , how can he take care of God's church ? ) .
54003006	He must not be a recent convert , or he may become conceited and fall into the same condemnation as the devil .
54003007	He must also have a good reputation with outsiders , so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
54003008	Deacons likewise must be men of dignity , not double-tongued , not addicted to much wine , and not fond of sordid gain ;
54003009	they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience .
54003010	They must also first be tested ; and then if they are beyond reproach , let them serve as deacons .
54003011	The women must likewise be dignified , not malicious gossips , but temperate , faithful in all things .
54003012	Deacons must be the husband of one wife , and must manage their children and their households well .
54003013	For those who have served well as deacons gain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus .
54003014	Although I hope to come to you soon , I am writing you these instructions so that ,
54003015	if I am delayed , you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and support of the truth .
54003016	By common confession , great is the mystery of godliness : he was revealed in the flesh , was vindicated in the Spirit , seen by angels , preached among the nations , believed on in the world , taken up in glory .
54004001	Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons ,
54004002	through the pretensions of liars , whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron ,
54004003	who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
54004004	For everything created by God is good , and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving ;
54004005	for it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer .
54004006	If you point out these things to the brethren , you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus , constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed .
54004007	Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales ; rather , train yourself in godliness .
54004008	For bodily training is of some value , but godliness is of value in all things , as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come .
54004009	It is a trustworthy saying worthy of full acceptance .
54004010	For to this end we labor and strive , because we have our hope set on the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
54004011	Command and teach these things .
54004012	Let no one look down on your youth , but set the believers an example in speech and conduct , in love , in faith , in purity .
54004013	Until I come , devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture , to preaching and to teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect the gift you have , which was given you through prophetic utterance when the council of elders laid their hands on you .
54004015	Be diligent in these matters ; give yourself wholly to them , so that all may see your progress .
54004016	Take heed to yourself and to your teaching ; persevere in them , for if you do , you will save both yourself and your hearers .
54005001	Do not rebuke an older man , but exhort him as a father , younger men as brothers ,
54005002	older women as mothers , and younger women as sisters , in all purity .
54005003	Honor widows who are real widows .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , they must first learn to practice their religion in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents ; for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
54005005	Now she who is a real widow , and who has been left all alone , has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day .
54005006	But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives .
54005007	Command these things as well , so that they may be above reproach .
54005008	If any one does not provide for his relatives , and especially for his own family , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old , having been the wife of one husband ,
54005010	and she must be well known for her good deeds , as one who has brought up children , shown hospitality , washed the feet of the saints , relieved those in distress , and devoted herself to doing good in every way .
54005011	But refuse to put younger widows on the list , for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ , they want to marry ,
54005012	thus bringing condemnation , because they have set aside their first pledge .
54005013	Besides , they learn to be idle , going about from house to house . And not only do they become idlers , but also gossips and busybodies , saying things they ought not to .
54005014	So I would have younger widows marry , bear children , manage their homes , and give the enemy no occasion for reproach .
54005015	For some have already turned aside to follow Satan .
54005016	If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows , she must assist them , and let not the church be burdened , so that it may assist those who are real widows .
54005017	The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor , especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching .
54005018	For the scripture says , » You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain , « and , » The laborer deserves his wages . «
54005019	Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses .
54005020	Those who continue in sin , rebuke in the presence of all , so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning .
54005021	I charge you , in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels , to keep these instructions without partiality , doing nothing out of favoritism .
54005022	Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands , and do not share in the sins of others ; keep yourself pure .
54005023	No longer drink only water , but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments .
54005024	The sins of some men are obvious , going before them to judgment ; for others , their sins appear later .
54005025	In the same way , good deeds are obvious , and even those that are not cannot be hidden .
54006001	Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor , so that the name of God and the teaching may not be spoken against .
54006002	Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren , but they must serve them all the better , because those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved . Teach and urge these duties .
54006003	If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness ,
54006004	he is conceited and understands nothing ; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words , which produce envy , strife , malicious talk , evil suspicions ,
54006005	and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth , who imagine that godliness is a means of gain .
54006006	But godliness with contentment is itself great gain .
54006007	For we brought nothing into the world , and we cannot take anything out of it .
54006008	But if we have food and clothing , with these we shall be content .
54006009	But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil , and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs .
54006011	But you , man of God , flee from all this , and pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , endurance and gentleness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of the faith ; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses .
54006013	I charge you in the presence of God , who gives life to all things , and of Christ Jesus , who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate ,
54006014	to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
54006015	which he will bring about at the proper time — he who is the blessed and only Sovereign , the King of kings and Lord of lords ,
54006016	who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light , whom no man has ever seen or can see . To him be honor and eternal dominion . Amen .
54006017	Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches , but on God , who richly supplies us with everything to enjoy .
54006018	Instruct them to do good , to be rich in good deeds , to be generous and ready to share ,
54006019	storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future , so that they may take hold of that life which is life indeed .
54006020	O Timothy , guard what has been entrusted to you . Avoid godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge ,
54006021	which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith . Grace be with you .
55001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	to Timothy , my beloved son : grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I thank God , whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did , as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day .
55001004	As I recall your tears , I long to see you , so that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	For I am reminded of your sincere faith , which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and I am sure is in you as well .
55001006	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For God did not give us a spirit of timidity , but a spirit of power and love and self-discipline .
55001008	So do not be ashamed to testify of our Lord or of me his prisoner , but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God ,
55001009	who has saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and the grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity ,
55001010	but has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ , who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel .
55001011	For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher .
55001012	For this reason I also suffer as I do . But I am not ashamed , for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day .
55001013	Follow the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me , in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Guard , through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us , the treasure that has been entrusted to you .
55001015	You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me , among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains ;
55001017	but when he was in Rome , he eagerly searched for me and found me —
55001018	may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day — and you know very well all the service he rendered at Ephesus .
55002001	You then , my son , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
55002002	And the things you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses , entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also .
55002003	Share in hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No soldier in active service gets entangled in civilian affairs , since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him as a soldier .
55002005	Also if anyone competes as an athlete , he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules .
55002006	The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops .
55002007	Consider what I say , for the Lord will give you understanding in everything .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , descended from David according to my gospel ,
55002009	for which I am suffering even to the point of wearing chains like a criminal . But the word of God is not chained .
55002010	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect , that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus , with eternal glory .
55002011	Here is a trustworthy saying : if we died with him , we will also live with him ;
55002012	
55002013	
55002014	Remind them of these things , and charge them in the presence of God to avoid disputing about words , which does no good , but only ruins the hearers .
55002015	Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved , a workman who does not need to be ashamed , rightly handling the word of truth .
55002016	Avoid godless chatter , for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness ,
55002017	and their talk will spread like gangrene . Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
55002018	who have gone astray from the truth . They say that the resurrection has already taken place , and upset the faith of some .
55002019	Nevertheless , God's firm foundation stands , having this seal : » The Lord knows those who are his , « and , » Everyone who names the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness . «
55002020	In a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware , and some for noble use , some for ignoble .
55002021	If anyone cleanses himself from what is ignoble , he will be a vessel for noble purposes , made holy , useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work .
55002022	Now flee from youthful lusts , and pursue righteousness , faith , love and peace , along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart .
55002023	Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments , because you know that they produce quarrels .
55002024	And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome , but he must be kind to everyone , able to teach , patient when wronged ,
55002025	with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition , if perhaps God will grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth ,
55002026	and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil , having been held captive by him to do his will .
55003001	But understand this , that in the last days there will come times of stress .
55003002	For men will be lovers of self , lovers of money , boastful , arrogant , abusive , disobedient to their parents , ungrateful , unholy ,
55003003	unloving , unforgiving , slanderous , without self-control , brutal , haters of good ,
55003004	treacherous , reckless , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ,
55003005	holding a form of godliness but denying its power . Avoid such people .
55003006	For among them are those who make their way into households and capture weak women , weighed down with sins and swayed by various impulses ,
55003007	always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
55003008	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so these men also oppose the truth , men of depraved mind , rejected in regard to the faith .
55003009	But they will not get very far , for their folly will be plain to all , as was that of those two men .
55003010	You , however , know all about my teaching , my conduct , my purpose , faith , patience , love , endurance ,
55003011	persecutions , and sufferings , such as happened to me at Antioch , at Iconium and at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured , yet the Lord rescued me from them all .
55003012	Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted ,
55003013	while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse , deceiving and being deceived .
55003014	But as for you , continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of , knowing from whom you learned it ,
55003015	and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness ;
55003017	so that the man of God may be complete , equipped for every good work .
55004001	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , who is to judge the living and the dead , and by his appearing and his kingdom :
55004002	preach the word ; be ready in season and out of season ; correct , rebuke , and exhort , with great patience and instruction .
55004003	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but having itching ears , they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires ,
55004004	and will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths .
55004005	But you , be sober in all things , endure hardship , do the work of an evangelist , fulfill your ministry .
55004006	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering , and the time of my departure has come .
55004007	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
55004008	In the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me on that day ; and not only to me , but also to all who have loved his appearing .
55004009	Do your best to come to me soon ;
55004010	for Demas , having loved this present world , has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , for he is useful to me in my ministry .
55004012	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas , and the books , especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm ; the Lord will repay him for his deeds .
55004015	Be on guard against him yourself , for he strongly opposed our message .
55004016	At my first defense no one came to my support , but all deserted me ; may it not be counted against them .
55004017	But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength , so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it . And I was rescued from the lion's mouth .
55004018	The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom . To him be the glory for ever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Greet Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus remained at Corinth , but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus .
55004021	Do your best to come before winter . Eubulus greets you , and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you .
56001001	Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ , for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness ,
56001002	in the hope of eternal life , which God , who cannot lie , promised long ages ago ,
56001003	and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior ,
56001004	to Titus , my true child in a common faith : grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior .
56001005	For this reason I left you in Crete , that you might straighten out what was left unfinished , and appoint elders in every town as I directed you ,
56001006	namely , if any man is blameless , the husband of one wife , and his children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild or rebellious .
56001007	For the overseer must be blameless as God's steward , not self-willed , not quick-tempered , not addicted to wine , not violent , not fond of sordid gain ,
56001008	but hospitable , a lover of what is good , master of himself , upright , holy , and self-controlled ;
56001009	he must hold firm to the sure word as taught , so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to refute those who contradict it .
56001010	For there are many rebellious men , empty talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision .
56001011	They must be silenced , because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they ought not to teach for the sake of sordid gain .
56001012	One of themselves , a prophet of their own , said , » Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons . «
56001013	This testimony is true . Therefore , rebuke them sharply , so that they may be sound in the faith
56001014	and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who reject the truth .
56001015	To the pure , all things are pure ; but to those who are corrupted and unbelieving , nothing is pure , but both their minds and consciences are corrupted .
56001016	They profess to know God , but they deny him by their deeds ; they are detestable and disobedient , unfit for any good deed .
56002001	But as for you , teach what befits sound doctrine .
56002002	The older men are to be temperate , serious , sensible , sound in faith , in love , and in endurance .
56002003	The older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior , not to be slanderers or slaves to much wine , but they are to teach what is good ,
56002004	so they can train the young women to love their husbands and children ,
56002005	to be sensible , pure , workers at home , kind , being subject to their own husbands , so that the word of God will not be dishonored .
56002006	Likewise urge the young men to be sensible .
56002007	Show yourself in all respects an example of good deeds , and in your teaching show integrity , seriousness ,
56002008	and sound speech that cannot be condemned , so that an opponent may be put to shame , having nothing bad to say about us .
56002009	Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything , to be well-pleasing , not to talk back to them ,
56002010	and not to steal , but to show that they can be fully trusted , so that in everything they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior .
56002011	For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men ,
56002012	training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions , and to live sober , upright , and godly lives in this present age ,
56002013	looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior , Christ Jesus ,
56002014	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own , zealous for good deeds .
56002015	Speak these things ; exhort and reprove with all authority . Let no one disregard you .
56003001	Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities , to be obedient , to be ready for every good deed ,
56003002	to speak evil of no one , to be peaceable and gentle , and to show true humility toward all men .
56003003	For we ourselves were once foolish , disobedient , deceived , enslaved to various passions and pleasures , passing our days in malice and envy , hated by men and hating one another .
56003004	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared ,
56003005	he saved us , not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness , but because of his own mercy , by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
56003007	so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
56003008	This is a trustworthy saying ; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently , so that those who have believed God may be careful to devote themselves to good deeds . These things are excellent and profitable for men .
56003009	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and quarrels about the Law , for they are unprofitable and useless .
56003010	Warn a man who is factious once , and then warn him a second time . After that , have nothing to do with him ,
56003011	knowing that such a man is perverted and sinful ; he is self-condemned .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Do your best to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way ; see that they lack nothing .
56003014	Our people must also learn to devote themselves to good deeds , so that they may help cases of urgent need , and not be unfruitful .
56003015	All who are with me send you greetings . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker ,
57001002	and to Apphia our sister , and to Archippus our fellow soldier , and to the church in your house :
57001003	grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers ,
57001005	because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints ,
57001006	and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing that is ours in Christ .
57001007	For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love , my brother , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you .
57001008	Therefore , though I am bold enough in Christ to order you to do what is proper ,
57001009	yet for love's sake I rather appeal to yousince I am such a person as Paul , the aged , and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus
57001010	I appeal to you for my child , Onesimus , whose father I have become in my imprisonment .
57001011	Formerly he was useless to you , but now he is useful both to you and to me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you , sending my very heart .
57001013	I would have been glad to keep him with me , so that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel ;
57001014	but without your consent I did not want to do anything , so that your goodness would not be , in effect , by compulsion but of your own free will .
57001015	Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while , that you might have him back for ever ,
57001016	no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , as a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much more to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
57001017	So if you consider me a partner , welcome him as you would welcome me .
57001018	If he has wronged you in any way , or owes you anything , charge that to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand , I will pay it backnot to mention that you owe me even your own self .
57001020	Yes , brother , let me have some benefit from you in the Lord ; refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	Confident of your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even more than I say .
57001022	At the same time , prepare a guest room for me , for I hope through your prayers to be granted to you .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends you greetings ,
57001024	and so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
58001001	In the past God spoke to our fathers by the prophets at many times and in various ways ,
58001002	but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , and through whom also he made the world .
58001003	He is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being , and upholds all things by the word of his power . When he had made purification for sins , he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,
58001004	having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs .
58001005	For to which of the angels did God ever say , » You are my son , today I have begotten you « ? And again , » I will be a father to him and he shall be a son to me « ?
58001006	And again , when God brings the first-born into the world , he says , » Let all God's angels worship him . «
58001007	Of the angels he says , » Who makes his angels winds , and his servants flames of fire . «
58001008	But of the Son he says , » Your throne , O God , is for ever and ever , and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom .
58001009	
58001010	And , » You , Lord , in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth , and the heavens are the work of your hands ;
58001011	
58001012	
58001013	But to which of the angels has he ever said , » Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies a stool for your feet « ?
58001014	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to serve for the sake of those who will inherit salvation ?
58002001	Therefore we must pay more careful attention to what we have heard , lest we drift away from it .
58002002	For if the message spoken by angels was valid , and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment ,
58002003	how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation ? It was declared at first by the Lord , and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him ,
58002004	while God also bore witness , by signs and wonders and various miracles , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will .
58002005	For it is not to angels that he subjected the world to come , about which we are speaking .
58002006	But there is a place where someone has testified , » What is man that you are mindful of him , or the son of man that you care for him ?
58002007	
58002008	
58002009	But we see Jesus , who for a little while was made lower than the angels , crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death , so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone .
58002010	For it was fitting that he , for whom and through whom all things exist , in bringing many sons to glory , should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering .
58002011	For both he who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one . That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
58002012	saying , » I will declare your name to my brethren , in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise . «
58002013	And again , » I will put my trust in him . « And again , » Here am I , and the children God has given me . «
58002014	Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood , he himself likewise partook of the same nature , that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death , that is , the devil ,
58002015	and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives .
58002016	For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned , but with the descendants of Abraham .
58002017	Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect , so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God , to make atonement for the sins of the people .
58002018	For because he himself has suffered , being tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .
58003001	Therefore , holy brethren , who share in a heavenly calling , consider Jesus , the apostle and high priest of our confession .
58003002	He was faithful to him who appointed him , just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house .
58003003	Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house .
58003004	For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God .
58003005	Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant , to testify to the things that were to be spoken later ,
58003006	but Christ is faithful as a son over God's house . And we are his house , if we hold fast to our confidence and the hope of which we boast .
58003007	Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says : » Today , if you will hear his voice ,
58003008	
58003009	
58003010	
58003011	
58003012	Take care , brethren , lest there be in any one of you an evil , unbelieving heart , leading you to fall away from the living God .
58003013	But exhort one another every day , as long as it is called » Today , « so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
58003014	For we have come to share in Christ if we hold our first confidence firm to the end ,
58003015	while it is said , » Today , if you will hear his voice , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion . «
58003016	Who were they who heard and rebelled ? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt ?
58003017	And with whom was he angry for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
58003018	And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest , but to those who were disobedient ?
58003019	So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief .
58004001	Therefore , while the promise of entering his rest remains , let us fear lest any one of you be judged to have come short of it .
58004002	For we also have had the good news preached to us , just as they did ; but the message they heard was of no value to them , because those who heard did not combine it with faith .
58004003	For we who have believed enter that rest , as he has said , » As I swore in my wrath , ‘ They shall never enter my rest , ’ « although his works were finished from the foundation of the world .
58004004	For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way : » And God rested on the seventh day from all his works . «
58004005	And again in this place he said , » They shall never enter my rest . «
58004006	Since therefore it remains for some to enter it , and those who formerly had the good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience ,
58004007	God again set a certain day , » Today , « saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before , » Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts . «
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest , God would not have spoken later of another day .
58004009	So then , there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God ;
58004010	for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work , just as God did from his .
58004011	Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest , so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience .
58004012	For the word of God is living and active , sharper than any two-edged sword , piercing even to the division of soul and spirit , of joints and marrow , and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
58004013	And there is no creature hidden from his sight , but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
58004014	Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession .
58004015	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are , yet without sin .
58004016	Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need .
58005001	For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God , to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray , since he himself is beset with weakness .
58005003	Because of this he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins , as well as for the sins of the people .
58005004	And no one takes the honor upon himself , but he is called by God , just as Aaron was .
58005005	So also Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest , but it was he who said to him , » You are my son , today I have begotten you « ;
58005006	as he says also in another place , » You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek . «
58005007	In the days of his flesh , Jesus offered up prayers and supplications , with loud cries and tears , to the one who was able to save him from death , and he was heard because of his godly fear .
58005008	Although he was a Son , he learned obedience from what he suffered ;
58005009	and , once made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him ,
58005010	being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	About this we have much to say which is hard to explain , since you have become dull of hearing .
58005012	For though by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you again the first principles of God's word . You need milk , not solid food ;
58005013	for every one who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness , for he is a babe .
58005014	But solid food is for the mature , for those who have their sense trained by practice to distinguish good from evil .
58006001	Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity , not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
58006002	with instruction about baptisms , the laying on of hands , the resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .
58006003	And this we will do , if God permits .
58006004	For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened , who have tasted the heavenly gift , and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come ,
58006006	and then have fallen away , to renew them again to repentance , since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God , and put him to an open shame .
58006007	For land which drinks the rain that often falls upon it , and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated , receives a blessing from God .
58006008	But if it bears thorns and thistles , it is worthless and near to being cursed ; its end is to be burned .
58006009	Even though we speak like this , beloved , we are confident of better things in your case , things that accompany salvation .
58006010	For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love which you have shown for his sake in serving the saints , as you still do .
58006011	And we desire each one of you to show the same diligence in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end ,
58006012	so that you may not be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
58006013	For when God made a promise to Abraham , since he had no one greater by whom to swear , he swore by himself ,
58006014	saying , » I will surely bless you and multiply you . «
58006015	And so Abraham , having patiently endured , obtained the promise .
58006016	Men swear by one greater than themselves , and in all their disputes the oath is final for confirmation .
58006017	So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose , he interposed with an oath ,
58006018	so that , by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us .
58006019	We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul , a hope that enters into the inner sanctuary behind the curtain ,
58006020	where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf , having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	For this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of the Most High God , met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him .
58007002	And to him Abraham gave a tenth part of everything . He is first , by translation of his name , king of righteousness , and then he is also king of Salem , that is , king of peace .
58007003	Without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God , he remains a priest continually .
58007004	See how great he was ! Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the spoils .
58007005	And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take a tenth from the people , that is , from their brethren , though these also are descended from Abraham .
58007006	But this man whose genealogy is not derived from them received a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises .
58007007	And without dispute the lesser person is blessed by the greater .
58007008	In this case tithes are received by mortal men , but in that case by one of whom it is witnessed that he lives on .
58007009	One might even say that Levi himself , who receives tithes , paid tithes through Abraham ,
58007010	for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him .
58007011	Now if perfection could have been through the Levitical priesthood ( for on the basis of it the people received the Law ) , what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek , and not one designated according to the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For when there is a change of the priesthood , there must also be a change of the law .
58007013	For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe , from which no one has ever served at the altar .
58007014	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah , and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests .
58007015	This becomes even more evident if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek ,
58007016	who has become a priest not on the basis of a law of carnal requirement , but according to the power of an indestructible life .
58007017	For it is declared of him , » You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek . «
58007018	On the one hand , a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness
58007019	( for the law made nothing perfect ) ; and on the other hand , a better hope is introduced , through which we draw near to God .
58007020	And it was not without an oath .
58007021	Those who formerly became priests took their office without an oath , but he became a priest with an oath through the One who said to him , » The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind , ‘ You are a priest forever . ’ «
58007022	Because of this oath , Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant .
58007023	The former priests were many in number , because they were prevented by death from continuing in office ;
58007024	but he holds his priesthood forever , because he continues for ever .
58007025	Therefore he is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through him , since he always lives to make intercession for them .
58007026	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest , holy , blameless , unstained , separated from sinners , exalted above the heavens .
58007027	He does not need , like those high priests , to offer up daily sacrifices , first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people , because he did this once for all when he offered up himself .
58007028	For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak , but the word of the oath , which came after the Law , appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever .
58008001	Now the point in what we are saying is this : we have such a high priest , one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven ,
58008002	a minister in the sanctuary , the true tabernacle which is set up by the Lord , not by man .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices ; and so it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer .
58008004	Now if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law .
58008005	They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary ; for when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle , he was instructed by God , saying , » See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain . «
58008006	But as it is , he has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better , since it is enacted on better promises .
58008007	For if that first covenant had been faultless , there would have been no place sought for a second .
58008008	For he finds fault with them when he says : » The days are coming , says the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ;
58008009	
58008010	
58008011	
58008012	
58008013	When he said , » A new covenant , « he has made the first obsolete . And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away .
58009001	Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary .
58009002	For there was a tabernacle prepared , the first one , in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread ; this is called the holy place .
58009003	Behind the second curtain was a tabernacle called the Holy of Holies ,
58009004	having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold , which contained a golden jar holding the manna , and Aaron's rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
58009005	and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat . But of these things we cannot now speak in detail .
58009006	These preparations having thus been made , the priests go continually into the outer tabernacle , performing their ritual duties .
58009007	But into the second only the high priest goes , and he but once a year , and not without taking blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance .
58009008	The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the holy place had not yet been disclosed as long as the outer tabernacle was still standing .
58009009	This is symbolic for the present time . According to this arrangement , gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper ,
58009010	since they relate only to food and drink and various washings – regulations for the flesh imposed until the time of reformation .
58009011	But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come , he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this creation .
58009012	He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves , but he entered the holy place once for all by his own blood , having obtained eternal redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh ,
58009014	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God , cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
58009015	For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant , that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance , now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the transgressions committed under the first covenant .
58009016	For where a will is , there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it .
58009017	For a will is in force only when somebody has died , since it never takes effect while the one who made it is living .
58009018	This is why even the first covenant was not ratified without blood .
58009019	For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
58009020	saying , » This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you . «
58009021	And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship .
58009022	Indeed , under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins .
58009023	It was necessary , then , for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands , a copy of the true one , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us .
58009025	Nor was it that he should offer himself again and again , as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood not his own .
58009026	For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world . But now , he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
58009027	And just as it is appointed for men to die once , and after that comes judgment ,
58009028	so Christ , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , will appear a second time , not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for him .
58010001	For since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities , it can never , by the same sacrifices which are continually offered year after year , make perfect those who draw near .
58010002	Otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered ? If the worshipers had once been cleansed , they would no longer have any consciousness of sins .
58010003	But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year .
58010004	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	Therefore , when Christ came into the world , he said : » Sacrifice and offering you did not desire , but a body you prepared for me ;
58010006	
58010007	
58010008	When he said above , » You did not desire , nor did you take pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings « ( these are offered according to the law ) ,
58010009	then he said , » Behold , I have come to do your will . « He takes away the first in order to establish the second .
58010010	And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58010011	And every priest stands daily at his service , offering time after time the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
58010012	But when he had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins , he sat down at the right hand of God ,
58010013	waiting from that time until his enemies be made a stool for his feet .
58010014	For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified .
58010015	And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us ; for after saying ,
58010016	
58010017	then he adds , » Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more . «
58010018	Where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer any offering for sin .
58010019	Therefore , brethren , since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	by a new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain , that is , his flesh ,
58010021	and since we have a great priest over the house of God ,
58010022	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water .
58010023	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering , for he who promised is faithful ;
58010024	and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works ,
58010025	not forsaking our own assembling together , as is the habit of some , but encouraging one another ; and all the more , as you see the Day drawing near .
58010026	For if we sin deliberately after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
58010027	but a fearful expectation of judgment , and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries .
58010028	Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much severer punishment do you think a man will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God , and has regarded as an unclean thing the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified , and has insulted the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know him who said , » Vengeance is mine , I will repay . « And again , » The Lord will judge his people . «
58010031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	But remember the former days when , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ,
58010033	sometimes being publicly exposed to insult and persecution ; and at other times standing side by side with those who were so treated .
58010034	For you had compassion on the prisoners , and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property , since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one .
58010035	Therefore do not throw away your confidence , which has a great reward .
58010036	For you have need of endurance , so that when you have done the will of God , you may receive what was promised .
58010037	
58010038	
58010039	But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed , but of those who have faith and keep their souls .
58011001	Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for , the conviction of things not seen .
58011002	For by it the men of old received divine approval .
58011003	By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God , so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible .
58011004	By faith Abel offered God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain , through which he was commended as a righteous man , when God spoke well of his gifts . And through faith he still speaks , even though he is dead .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death ; and he was not found , because God had taken him . For before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God .
58011006	And without faith it is impossible to please God , for anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him .
58011007	By faith Noah , being warned by God about things not yet seen , in godly fear prepared an ark for the salvation of his household , by which he condemned the world , and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance ; and he went out , not knowing where he was going .
58011009	By faith he lived in the land of promise , as in a foreign land , dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob , heirs with him of the same promise ;
58011010	for he was looking forward to the city which has foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
58011011	By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive , even when she was past the age , because she considered him faithful who had promised .
58011012	Therefore from one man , and him as good as dead , were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore .
58011013	These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and greeted them from a distance , and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth .
58011014	For people who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own .
58011015	And if they had been thinking of that country from which they had gone out , they would have had opportunity to return .
58011016	But as it is , they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God , for he has prepared for them a city .
58011017	By faith Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son ,
58011018	of whom it was said , » Through Isaac shall your descendants be called . «
58011019	He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead ; from which , figuratively speaking , he did receive him back .
58011020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future .
58011021	By faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph , when he was at the end of his life , made mention of the exodus of the Israelites , and gave orders concerning his bones .
58011023	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw he was a beautiful child ; and they were not afraid of the king's edict .
58011024	By faith Moses , when he was grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter ,
58011025	choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin .
58011026	He considered abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt , for he was looking ahead to his reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the anger of the king ; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood , so the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them .
58011029	By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land ; but when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were drowned .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient , because she had welcomed the spies .
58011032	And what more shall I say ? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets ,
58011033	who through faith conquered kingdoms , performed acts of justice , received promises , shut the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , whose weakness was turned to strength , who became mighty in war , and put foreign armies to flight .
58011035	Women received back their dead , raised to life again . Others were tortured and refused to be released , so that they might gain a better resurrection .
58011036	And others experienced mockings and scourgings , yes , also chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned , they were sawn in two , they were killed with the sword ; they went about in skins of sheep and goats , destitute , afflicted , ill-treated –
58011038	of whom the world was not worthy – wandering in deserts and mountains , and in caves and holes in the ground .
58011039	And all these , though well attested by their faith , did not receive what was promised ,
58011040	because God had provided something better for us , that apart from us they should not be made perfect .
58012001	Therefore , since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses , let us also lay aside every weight , and the sin which so easily entangles us , and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us ,
58012002	fixing our eyes on Jesus , the author and perfecter of our faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself , so that you may not grow weary and lose heart .
58012004	In your struggle against sin , you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood .
58012005	And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons ? – » My son , do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord , nor lose courage when you are rebuked by him .
58012006	
58012007	It is for discipline that you endure . God is treating you as sons ; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
58012008	If you are left without discipline , in which all have become partakers , then you are illegitimate children and not sons .
58012009	Besides this , we have had fathers of our flesh to discipline us and we respected them . Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live ?
58012010	For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them , but he disciplines us for our good , that we may share his holiness .
58012011	For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant ; but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it .
58012012	Therefore lift your feeble hands and strengthen your weak knees ,
58012013	and make straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame may not be put out of joint , but rather be healed .
58012014	Strive for peace with all men , and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord .
58012015	See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God ; that no root of bitterness spring up and cause trouble , and by it many become defiled ;
58012016	that no one be immoral or godless like Esau , who sold his own birthright for a single meal .
58012017	For you know that afterward , when he desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for repentance , though he sought it diligently with tears .
58012018	For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire , and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind ,
58012019	and the blast of a trumpet , and the sound of a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further word be spoken to them .
58012020	For they could not endure the order that was given , » If even a beast touches the mountain , it shall be stoned . «
58012021	The sight was so terrifying that Moses said , » I am trembling with fear . «
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to myriads of angels , to the joyful assembly
58012023	and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , and to God , the Judge of all , and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect ,
58012024	and to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel .
58012025	See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking . For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth , how much less shall we escape , if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven ?
58012026	Then his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , » Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also heaven . «
58012027	This phrase , » Yet once more , « indicates the removing of those things which can be shaken , as of created things , in order that what cannot be shaken may remain .
58012028	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken , let us be thankful , and offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe ,
58012029	for our God is a consuming fire .
58013001	Let brotherly love continue .
58013002	Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers , for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember the prisoners , as though in prison with them , and those who are ill-treated , since you yourselves are also in the body .
58013004	Let marriage be held in honor among all , and let the marriage bed be undefiled ; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous .
58013005	Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have , for God has said , » I will never leave you , nor will I forsake you . «
58013006	So we say with confidence , » The Lord is my helper ; I will not be afraid . What can man do to me ? «
58013007	Remember your leaders , those who spoke to you the word of God ; consider the outcome of their life , and imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
58013009	Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings ; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace , not by foods , through which those who were so occupied were not benefited .
58013010	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat .
58013011	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside the camp .
58013012	And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people through his own blood .
58013013	Let us , then , go to him outside the camp , bearing the disgrace he bore .
58013014	For here we do not have an enduring city , but we are looking for the city which is to come .
58013015	Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God , that is , the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name .
58013016	Do not forget to do good and to share with others , for with such sacrifices God is pleased .
58013017	Obey your leaders and submit to them ; for they are keeping watch over your souls , as men who will have to give account . Let them do this with joy , and not with grief , for that would be of no advantage to you .
58013018	Pray for us , for we are sure that we have a clear conscience , desiring to live honorably in all things .
58013019	I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you the sooner .
58013020	Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the eternal covenant ,
58013021	equip you with every good thing to do his will , working in us that which is pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
58013022	I urge you , brethren , bear with my word of exhortation , for I have written to you briefly .
58013023	You should know that our brother Timothy has been released , with whom I will see you if he comes soon .
58013024	Greet all your leaders and all the saints . Those who come from Italy send you greetings .
58013025	Grace be with you all .
59001001	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion : greetings .
59001002	Consider it all joy , my brethren , when you encounter various trials ,
59001003	for you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance .
59001004	And let endurance have its perfect result , so that you may be perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
59001005	If any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all generously and without reproach , and it will be given to him .
59001006	But he must ask in faith , with no doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind .
59001007	For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord ,
59001008	being a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways .
59001009	But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position ;
59001010	and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation , because like the flower of the grass he will pass away .
59001011	For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass ; its flower falls and its beauty is destroyed . So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits .
59001012	Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial , for when he has stood the test , he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him .
59001013	Let no one say when he is tempted , » I am being tempted by God « ; for God cannot be tempted by evil , and he himself does not tempt anyone .
59001014	But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own desire .
59001015	Then when desire has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and when sin is full-grown , it brings forth death .
59001016	Do not be deceived , my beloved brethren .
59001017	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow .
59001018	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures .
59001019	This you know , my beloved brethren . But everyone must be quick to hear , slow to speak and slow to anger ,
59001020	for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God .
59001021	Therefore , putting aside all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness , in humility receive the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
59001022	But prove yourselves doers of the word , and not merely hearers who deceive themselves .
59001023	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror ;
59001024	for he looks at himself and goes away , and immediately forgets what he was like .
59001025	But one who looks intently into the perfect law , the law of liberty , and abides by it , not having become a forgetful hearer but a doer that acts , this man will be blessed in what he does .
59001026	If anyone thinks himself to be religious , and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart , this man's religion is worthless .
59001027	Religion that is pure and undefiled in the sight of our God and Father is this : to visit orphans and widows in their distress , and to keep oneself unstained by the world .
59002001	My brethren , show no favoritism as you hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ .
59002002	For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes , and there also comes in a poor man in shabby clothes ,
59002003	and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes and say , » Have a seat here in a good place , « and you say to the poor man , » You stand there , « or , » Sit by my feet , «
59002004	have you not made distinctions among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my beloved brethren : has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor man . Is it not the rich who oppress you ? Is it not they who drag you into court ?
59002007	Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name by which you have been called ?
59002008	If you really fulfill the royal law , according to the scripture , » You shall love your neighbor as yourself , « you are doing well .
59002009	But if you show partiality , you commit sin , and are convicted by the law as transgressors .
59002010	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all of it .
59002011	For he who said , » Do not commit adultery , « said also , » Do not murder . « If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
59002012	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty .
59002013	For judgment will be without mercy to one who has shown no mercy ; mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	What good is it , my brethren , if a man says he has faith but has no works ? Can such faith save him ?
59002015	If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food ,
59002016	and one of you says to them , » Go in peace , be warmed and filled , « and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body , what use is that ?
59002017	So faith by itself , if it has no works , is dead .
59002018	But someone will say , » You have faith and I have works . « Show me your faith without the works , and I will show you my faith by my works .
59002019	You believe that God is one ; you do well . Even the demons believe — and shudder .
59002020	But are you willing to know , O foolish man , that faith without works is useless ?
59002021	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ?
59002022	You see that faith was working with his works , and faith was completed by works ,
59002023	and the scripture was fulfilled which says , » Abraham believed God , and it was reckoned to him as righteousness « , and he was called the friend of God .
59002024	You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone .
59002025	In the same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works , when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way ?
59002026	For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
59003001	Let not many of you become teachers , my brethren , for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness .
59003002	For we all stumble in many ways . If anyone does not stumble in what he says , he is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body as well .
59003003	If we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey us , we guide their whole bodies .
59003004	Look at the ships also ; though they are so great and are driven by strong winds , they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs .
59003005	So also the tongue is a small part of the body , and yet it boasts of great things . See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire , a world of evil among the members of the body . The tongue corrupts our whole person , sets the whole course of our life on fire , and is itself set on fire by hell .
59003007	For every species of beasts and birds , of reptiles and creatures of the sea , is tamed and has been tamed by the human race .
59003008	But no man can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless our Lord and Father , and with it we curse men , who have been made in the likeness of God .
59003010	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing . My brethren , this ought not to be so .
59003011	Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water ?
59003012	Can a fig tree , my brethren , produce olives , or a grapevine produce figs ? Nor can salt water produce fresh .
59003013	Who is wise and understanding among you ? By his good life let him show his deeds in the humility of wisdom .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts , do not boast and be false to the truth .
59003015	This wisdom is not such as comes down from above , but is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
59003016	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist , there will be disorder and every evil practice .
59003017	But the wisdom from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , open to reason , full of mercy and good fruits , without uncertainty or hypocrisy .
59003018	And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace .
59004001	What causes quarrels and fights among you ? Is it not your passions that are at war in your members ?
59004002	You desire and do not have ; so you kill . And you covet and cannot obtain ; so you fight and quarrel . You do not have , because you do not ask .
59004003	You ask and do not receive , because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it on your pleasures .
59004004	You adulteresses , do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God ? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you think that the Scripture says without reason : » He jealously desires the Spirit which he has made to dwell in us « ?
59004006	But he gives more grace . Therefore it says , » God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble . «
59004007	Submit yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59004009	Be miserable and mourn and weep . Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom .
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will exalt you .
59004011	Do not speak against one another , brethren . He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it .
59004012	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge , the one who is able to save and destroy . But you — who are you to judge your neighbor ?
59004013	Come now , you who say , » Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city , and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit . «
59004014	Yet you do not know what will happen tomorrow . What is your life ? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes .
59004015	Instead , you ought to say , » If the Lord wills , we will live and do this or that . «
59004016	As it is , you boast in your arrogance . All such boasting is evil .
59004017	Therefore , to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it , to him it is sin .
59005001	Come now , you rich , weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you .
59005002	Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and silver have rusted , and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire . You have laid up treasure in the last days .
59005004	Behold , the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you kept back by fraud , cry out against you ; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts .
59005005	You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure ; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned and put to death the righteous man ; he does not resist you .
59005007	Therefore be patient , brethren , until the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rains .
59005008	You too be patient ; strengthen your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is near .
59005009	Do not grumble , brethren , against one another , that you may not be judged ; behold , the Judge is standing at the door .
59005010	As an example , brethren , of suffering and patience , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59005011	Behold , we call those blessed who endured . You have heard of the endurance of Job , and you have seen the purpose of the Lord , how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
59005012	But above all , my brethren , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath , but let your yes be yes and your no be no , that you may not fall under condemnation .
59005013	Is anyone among you suffering ? He should pray . Is anyone cheerful ? Let him sing praise .
59005014	Is any among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord ;
59005015	and the prayer offered in faith will save the sick man , and the Lord will raise him up ; and if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
59005016	Therefore , confess your sins to one another , and pray for one another so that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective .
59005017	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months .
59005018	Then he prayed again , and the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its fruit .
59005019	My brethren , if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back ,
59005020	let him know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins .
60001001	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen exiles in the Dispersion , scattered throughout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia and Bithynia ,
60001002	who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , by the sanctifying work of the Spirit , for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling with his blood : may grace and peace be yours in abundance .
60001003	Blessed be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! In his great mercy he has caused us to be born again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60001004	to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away , kept in heaven for you ,
60001005	who are protected by God's power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
60001006	In this you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials ,
60001007	so that the proof of your faith , being more precious than gold which is perishable , even though tested by fire , may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001008	Though you have not seen him , you love him ; and even though you do not see him now , you believe in him and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy ,
60001009	as you obtain the outcome of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
60001010	As to this salvation , the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you inquired and searched carefully ,
60001011	seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow .
60001012	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves , but you , in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven — things into which angels long to look .
60001013	Therefore , prepare your minds for action , be sober in spirit , set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001014	As obedient children , do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance ,
60001015	but as he who called you is holy , be holy yourselves in all your conduct ;
60001016	because it is written , » You shall be holy , for I am holy . «
60001017	If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work , conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your exile on earth .
60001018	You know that you were redeemed from the futile way of life inherited from your forefathers , not with perishable things such as silver or gold ,
60001019	but with the precious blood of Christ , like that of a lamb without blemish or spot .
60001020	He was destined before the foundation of the world , but was revealed in these last times for your sake .
60001021	Through him you have confidence in God , who raised him from the dead and gave him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God .
60001022	Since you have purified your souls by obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren , love one another earnestly from the heart .
60001023	For you have been born again , not of perishable seed , but of imperishable , through the living and enduring word of God .
60001024	For , » All flesh is like grass , and all its glory like the flower of grass . The grass withers , and the flower falls ,
60001025	
60002001	Therefore , put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander .
60002002	Like newborn babes , long for the pure spiritual milk , so that by it you may grow up in your salvation ,
60002003	for you have tasted the kindness of the Lord .
60002004	As you come to him , the living Stone — rejected by men but chosen and precious in the sight of God —
60002005	you also , like living stones , are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood , to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	For it stands in scripture : » Behold , I lay in Zion a stone , a cornerstone chosen and precious , and he who believes in him will not be put to shame . «
60002007	To you therefore who believe , this is precious , but for those who do not believe , » The very stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone , «
60002008	and , » A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall ; « they stumble because they disobey the word — as they were desstined to do .
60002009	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God's own possession , that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light .
60002010	
60002011	Beloved , I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against your soul .
60002012	Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles , so that in case they speak against you as wrongdoers , they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation .
60002013	Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution , whether to a king as the supreme authority ,
60002014	or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right .
60002015	For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of foolish men .
60002016	Live as free men , but do not use your freedom as a covering for evil ; live as servants of God .
60002017	Honor all people , love the brotherhood , fear God , honor the king .
60002018	Servants , be submissive to your masters with all respect , not only to those who are good and gentle , but also to those who are overbearing .
60002019	For a man is approved if , mindful of God , he bears up under pain while suffering unjustly .
60002020	For what credit is it , if when you do wrong and are beaten for it you patiently endure ? But if when you do right and suffer for it you patiently endure , you have favor with God .
60002021	For to this you have been called , because Christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example , that you should follow in his steps .
60002022	
60002023	when he was reviled , he did not revile in return ; when he suffered , he uttered no threats , but he trusted himself to him who judges justly .
60002024	He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree , so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness ; by his wounds you have been healed .
60002025	For you were straying like sheep , but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls .
60003001	You wives , in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that , if any of them do not believe the word , they may be won over without a word by the behavior of their wives ,
60003002	when they see your chaste and respectful behavior .
60003003	Your adornment must not be merely outward — braiding the hair , and wearing gold jewelry , or putting on fine clothing ;
60003004	but let it be the hidden person of the heart , with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is precious in God's sight .
60003005	For in this way in former times the holy women also , who hoped in God , used to adorn themselves , and were submissive to their own husbands ;
60003006	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . And you are her children if you do what is right and are not frightened by any fear .
60003007	Husbands , in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives , and treat them with honor as the weaker partner , since you are joint heirs of the grace of life , so that your prayers will not be hindered .
60003008	Finally , all of you , live in harmony with one another ; be sympathetic , love as brothers , be compassionate and humble in spirit .
60003009	Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult , but give a blessing instead ; for to this you were called , that you may inherit a blessing .
60003010	For , » He who would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit .
60003011	
60003012	
60003013	Who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good ?
60003014	But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness , you are blessed . Do not fear their intimidation , and do not be troubled ,
60003015	but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord . Always be prepared to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you , yet do it with gentleness and respect ;
60003016	and keep a clear conscience , so that , when you are abused , those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame .
60003017	For it is better to suffer for doing right , if that should be God's will , than for doing wrong .
60003018	For Christ also died for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit ;
60003019	in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison ,
60003020	who formerly did not obey , when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah , during the building of the ark , in which a few , that is , eight persons , were saved through water .
60003021	And corresponding to that , baptism now saves you — not the removal of dirt from the flesh , but an appeal to God for a good conscience — through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60003022	who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God , with angels and authorities and powers subject to him .
60004001	Therefore , since Christ has suffered in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same purpose , because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ,
60004002	so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human lusts , but for the will of God .
60004003	For you have spent enough time in the past doing what the Gentiles like to do , living in debauchery , lust , drunkenness , orgies , carousing , and lawless idolatry .
60004004	In all this , they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same flood of dissipation , and they abuse you ;
60004005	but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For this reason the gospel was preached even to those who are dead , that though they are judged in the flesh as men , they might live in the spirit according to the will of God .
60004007	The end of all things is near ; therefore be clear minded and sober for your prayers .
60004008	Above all , hold unfailing your love for one another , because love covers a multitude of sins .
60004009	Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling .
60004010	As each one has received a special gift , employ it in serving one another as good stewards of God's varied grace .
60004011	Whoever speaks is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God ; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies ; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ . To him belongs the glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
60004012	Beloved , do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which comes upon you to test you , as though something strange were happening to you .
60004013	But rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ , so that you may also be overjoyed when his glory is revealed .
60004014	If you are insulted because of the name of Christ , you are blessed , for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you .
60004015	But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or a wrongdoer , or a troublesome meddler ;
60004016	yet if one suffers as a Christian , let him not be ashamed , but under that name let him glorify God .
60004017	For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God ; and if it begins with us , what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God ?
60004018	And » if it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what will become of the godless man and the sinner ? «
60004019	Therefore , let those who suffer according to God's will do right and entrust their souls to a faithful Creator .
60005001	So I exhort the elders among you , as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and a partaker in the glory that is to be revealed ,
60005002	shepherd the flock of God that is under your care , serving as overseers — not under compulsion , but voluntarily , according to the will of God ; and not for sordid gain , but with eagerness ;
60005003	not as lording it over those in your charge , but being examples to the flock .
60005004	And when the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the unfading crown of glory .
60005005	Likewise you that are younger men be subject to the elders . Clothe yourselves , all of you , with humility toward one another , for » God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble . «
60005006	Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time .
60005007	Cast all your anxiety on him , because he cares for you .
60005008	Be sober , be alert . Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion , seeking someone to devour .
60005009	But resist him , firm in your faith , knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren throughout the world .
60005010	And after you have suffered a little while , the God of all grace , who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ , will himself restore , establish , and strengthen you .
60005011	To him be the dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
60005012	With the help of Silvanus , a faithful brother as I regard him , I have written to you briefly , exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God . Stand fast in it .
60005013	She who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , sends you her greetings , and so does my son Mark .
60005014	Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace to all of you who are in Christ .
61001001	Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours , by the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
61001002	grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord .
61001003	His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness , through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence .
61001004	By these he has granted to us his precious and very great promises , so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust , and become partakers of the divine nature .
61001005	For this very reason , make every effort to add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue , knowledge ,
61001006	and to knowledge , self-control , and to self-control , perseverance , and to perseverance , godliness ,
61001007	and to godliness , brotherly kindness , and to brotherly kindness , love .
61001008	For if these qualities are yours and are increasing , they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	For whoever lacks these things is blind and shortsighted , and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins .
61001010	Therefore , brethren , be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure . For if you do these things , you will never fall ;
61001011	so there will be an entrance richly provided for you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	Therefore I will always remind you of these things , even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have .
61001013	I think it right , as long as I am in this body , to stir you up by way of reminder ,
61001014	since I know that the putting aside of my body will be soon , as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me .
61001015	And I will see to it that after my departure you will be able at any time to call these things to mind .
61001016	For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
61001017	For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him by the Majestic Glory , saying , » This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . «
61001018	We ourselves heard this voice coming from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	And we have the prophetic word made more sure , and you will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	First of all you must understand this , that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation ,
61001021	for no prophecy was ever made by the act of human will , but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God .
61002001	But false prophets also arose among the people , just as there will also be false teachers among you , who will secretly introduce destructive heresies , even denying the Master who bought them , bringing swift destruction upon themselves .
61002002	And many will follow their licentiousness , and because of them the way of truth will be reviled .
61002003	And in their greed they will exploit you with false words ; from long ago their condemnation has not been idle , and their destruction has not been asleep .
61002004	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
61002005	and if he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a preacher of righteousness , with seven others , when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
61002006	and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes , having made them an example to those who would live ungodly thereafter ;
61002007	and if he rescued Lot , a righteous man , who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men
61002008	( for by what he saw and heard that righteous man , while living among them , felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds ) ,
61002009	then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment ,
61002010	and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desire and despise authority . Bold and willful , they are not afraid to revile the glorious ones ,
61002011	whereas angels , though greater in power and might , do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these , like irrational animals , creatures of instinct , born to be caught and killed , reviling in matters of which they are ignorant , will be destroyed in the same destruction with them ,
61002013	suffering wrong for their wrongdoing . They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime . They are blots and blemishes , reveling in their deceptions , as they carouse with you .
61002014	They have eyes full of adultery , that never cease from sin ; they entice unstable souls . They have hearts trained in greed . Accursed children !
61002015	Forsaking the right way , they have gone astray , having followed the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
61002016	but he was rebuked for his own transgression by a donkey — a beast without speech — who spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness .
61002017	These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm ; for them the blackest darkness has been reserved .
61002018	For speaking out arrogant words of vanity , they entice by fleshly desires , by sensuality , those who barely escape from the ones who live in error .
61002019	They promise them freedom , while they themselves are slaves of corruption ; for whatever overcomes a man , to that he is enslaved .
61002020	For if , after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in them and are overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
61002021	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than having known it , to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them .
61002022	It has happened to them according to the true proverb , » A dog turns back to its own vomit , « and , » A sow , after having washed , returns to wallowing in the mire . «
61003001	This is now the second letter that I have written to you , beloved , and in both of them I have aroused your sincere mind by way of reminder ;
61003002	that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles .
61003003	First of all you must understand this , that scoffers will come in the last days , with scoffing , following their own lusts
61003004	and saying , » Where is the promise of his coming ? For ever since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation . «
61003005	They deliberately ignore this fact , that by the word of God heavens existed long ago , and the earth was formed out of water and by means of water ,
61003006	through which the world at that time was destroyed , being deluged with water .
61003007	But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire , being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
61003008	But do not ignore this one fact , beloved , that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years , and a thousand years like one day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow about his promise , as some count slowness , but is patient toward you , not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief , in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with fire , and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up .
61003011	Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way , what sort of people ought you to be in holy lives and godliness ,
61003012	looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God , because of which the heavens will be destroyed by fire , and the elements will melt with intense heat !
61003013	But according to his promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth , in which righteousness dwells .
61003014	Therefore , beloved , since you look for these things , be diligent to be found by him in peace , spotless and blameless .
61003015	And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; just as also our beloved brother Paul , according to the wisdom given him , wrote to you .
61003016	He writes the same way in all his letters , speaking in them of these matters . His letters contain some things that are hard to understand , which ignorant and unstable people distort , as they do the other Scriptures , to their own destruction .
61003017	You therefore , beloved , knowing this beforehand , be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness .
61003018	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity . Amen .
62001001	That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have touched , concerning the Word of life —
62001002	the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and testify to it , and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us —
62001003	that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so that you may have fellowship with us ; and our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ .
62001004	And we write this that our joy may be complete .
62001005	This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you , that God is light and in him is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we say we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie and do not live according to the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin .
62001008	If we say we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just , and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
62001010	If we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
62002001	My little children , I write this to you so that you may not sin . But if anyone does sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous .
62002002	And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world .
62002003	Now by this we know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
62002004	He who says , » I know him , « but does not keep his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
62002005	But whoever keeps his word , truly the love of God is perfected in him . By this we know that we are in him :
62002006	he who says he abides in him ought to walk as he walked .
62002007	Beloved , I am writing you no new commandment , but an old commandment that you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word that you have heard .
62002008	Yet I am writing you a new commandment , which is true in him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining .
62002009	He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness still .
62002010	He who loves his brother abides in the light , and there is no cause for stumbling in him .
62002011	But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness , and does not know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	
62002013	
62002014	
62002015	Do not love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
62002016	For all that is in the world — the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life — is not of the Father but is of the world .
62002017	And the world is passing away , and the lust of it ; but he who does the will of God abides forever .
62002018	Little children , it is the last hour ; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have come ; by this we know that it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have continued with us ; but they went out that it might be plain that none of them were of us .
62002020	But you have an anointing from the Holy One , and you all know .
62002021	I write to you , not because you do not know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This is the Antichrist , he who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one who denies the Son has the Father ; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also .
62002024	Let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning . If what you heard from the beginning abides in you , then you also will abide in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is what he has promised us — eternal life .
62002026	These things I have written to you about those who try to deceive you .
62002027	But the anointing which you have received from him abides in you , and you do not need that anyone teach you ; but as his anointing teaches you about all things , and is true , and is not a lie , and just as it has taught you , abide in him .
62002028	And now , little children , abide in him , so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous , you know that everyone who does right is born of him .
62003001	See what love the Father has given us , that we should be called children of God ! And so we are ! The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him .
62003002	Beloved , now we are children of God ; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be , but we know that when he appears , we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he is .
62003003	And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself , just as he is pure .
62003004	Everyone who commits sin also commits lawlessness ; sin is lawlessness .
62003005	And you know that he appeared to take away our sins , and in him there is no sin .
62003006	No one who abides in him sins . No one who sins has either seen him or known him .
62003007	Little children , let no one deceive you . He who does right is righteous , just as he is righteous .
62003008	He who commits sin is of the devil , for the devil has sinned from the beginning . The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	No one who is of God practices sin , for God’s seed remains in him ; and he cannot sin , because he has been born of God .
62003010	By this it may be seen who are the children of God , and who are the children of the devil : whoever does not do right is not of God , nor he who does not love his brother .
62003011	For this is the message which you heard from the beginning , that we should love one another ,
62003012	and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous .
62003013	Do not marvel , my brethren , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren . He who does not love abides in death .
62003015	Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him .
62003016	By this we know love , that he laid down his life for us . And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
62003017	But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need , yet closes his heart against him , how does the love of God abide in him ?
62003018	Little children , let us not love in word or tongue but in deed and in truth .
62003019	By this we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him
62003020	whenever our hearts condemn us ; for God is greater than our hearts , and he knows everything .
62003021	Beloved , if our hearts do not condemn us , we have confidence before God ;
62003022	and we receive from him whatever we ask , because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him .
62003023	And this is his commandment : that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , just as he has commanded us .
62003024	Now those who keep his commandments abide in him , and he in them . And by this we know that he abides in us , by the Spirit whom he has given us .
62004001	Beloved , do not believe every spirit , but test the spirits to see whether they are of God ; because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	By this you know the Spirit of God : every Spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God ,
62004003	and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God . This is the spirit of the Antichrist , of which you have heard that it was coming , and now it is in the world already .
62004004	You are of God , little children , and have overcome them , because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world .
62004005	They are of the world and therefore speak as of the world , and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are of God . Whoever knows God listens to us ; he who is not of God does not listen to us . By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error .
62004007	Beloved , let us love one another , for love is of God ; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God .
62004008	He who does not love does not know God , for God is love .
62004009	In this the love of God was made manifest among us , that God sent his only Son into the world , so that we might live through him .
62004010	In this is love , not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
62004011	Beloved , if God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God ; but if we love one another , God abides in us and his love is perfected in us .
62004013	By this we know that we abide in him and he in us , because he has given us of his Spirit .
62004014	And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world .
62004015	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides in him , and he in God .
62004016	So we know and believe the love God has for us . God is love , and he who abides in love abides in God , and God in him .
62004017	In this love is perfected among us , that we may have confidence for the Day of Judgment , because as he is so are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love , but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has to do with punishment . And he who fears is not made perfect in love .
62004019	We love because he first loved us .
62004020	If anyone says , » I love God , « and hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen , cannot love God whom he has not seen .
62004021	And this commandment we have from him : that he who loves God must love his brother also .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God , and everyone who loves the parent loves the child .
62005002	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and obey his commandments .
62005003	For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments . And his commandments are not burdensome .
62005004	For whatever is born of God overcomes the world . And this is the victory that has overcome the world — our faith .
62005005	Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62005006	This is he who came by water and blood — Jesus Christ ; not only by water , but by water and blood .
62005007	And it is the Spirit who bears witness , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005008	There are three witnesses , the Spirit , the water , and the blood ; and these three agree .
62005009	If we receive the testimony of men , the testimony of God is greater ; for this is the testimony of God which he has borne witness of his Son .
62005010	He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . He who does not believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given of his Son .
62005011	And this is the testimony : that God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	He who has the Son has life ; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life .
62005013	I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , so that you may know that you have eternal life .
62005014	And this is the confidence which we have in him , that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us .
62005015	And if we know that he hears us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him .
62005016	If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death , he will ask , and God will give him life for those whose sin is not leading to death . There is sin leading to death . I do not say that he should pray about that .
62005017	All wrongdoing is sin , and there is sin that does not lead to death .
62005018	We know that anyone born of God does not sin ; but he who was born of God keeps him , and the evil one does not touch him .
62005019	We know that we are of God , and the whole world is under the power of the evil one .
62005020	And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding , that we may know him who is true ; and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God and eternal life .
62005021	Little children , keep yourselves from idols .
63001001	The elder to the chosen lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not only I , but also all who know the truth ,
63001002	because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever :
63001003	grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son , in truth and love .
63001004	I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth , just as we have been commanded by the Father .
63001005	And now I ask you , lady , not as though I were writing you a new commandment , but the one we have had from the beginning , that we love one another .
63001006	And this is love , that we walk according to his commandments . This is the commandment , just as you have heard from the beginning , that you should walk in love .
63001007	For many deceivers , who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh , have gone out into the world . Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist .
63001008	Watch yourselves , that you do not lose what you have worked for , but that you may receive a full reward .
63001009	Anyone who runs ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God ; he who abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting ;
63001011	for he who greets him shares in his wicked work .
63001012	Though I have much to write to you , I do not want to use paper and ink , but I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face , so that our joy may be complete .
63001013	The children of your chosen sister greet you .
64001001	The elder to the beloved Gaius , whom I love in truth .
64001002	Beloved , I pray that you may be in good health and that all may go well with you , even as your soul is getting along well .
64001003	For I greatly rejoiced when some of the brethren arrived and testified to the truth of your life , and how you are walking in truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this , to hear that my children are walking in the truth .
64001005	Beloved , you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren , and especially when they are strangers ;
64001006	and they have testified to your love before the church . You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God .
64001007	For they went out for the sake of the Name , accepting nothing from the Gentiles .
64001008	Therefore we ought to support such men , so that we may be fellow workers in the truth .
64001009	I wrote something to the church ; but Diotrephes , who loves to be first among them , does not accept what we say .
64001010	So if I come , I will call attention to what he is doing , gossiping against us with evil words . And not satisfied with that , he refuses himself to welcome the brethren , and also stops those who want to welcome them and puts them out of the church .
64001011	Beloved , do not imitate what is evil , but what is good . The one who does good is of God ; the one who does evil has not seen God .
64001012	Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone , and from the truth itself ; and we add our testimony , and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I had much to write you , but I do not want to do so with pen and ink ;
64001014	I hope to see you soon , and we will talk face to face . Peace to you . The friends here send their greetings . Greet the friends there by name .
64001015	
65001001	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James , to those who are called , beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ :
65001002	may mercy , peace , and love be multiplied to you .
65001003	Beloved , although I was very eager to write you about our common salvation , I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints .
65001004	For certain persons have crept in secretly , those who were long ago marked out for this condemnation , ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65001005	Now I desire to remind you , though you were once for all fully informed , that the Lord who saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	And the angels who did not keep their own domain , but abandoned their proper abode , he has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day ,
65001007	just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities , which likewise acted immorally and indulged in strange flesh , serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	Yet in the same way these men in their dreamings defile the flesh , reject authority , and revile the glorious ones .
65001009	But Michael the archangel , when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses , did not dare pronounce against him a reviling judgment , but said , » The Lord rebuke you ! «
65001010	But these men revile whatever they do not understand ; and the things that they know by instinct , like unreasoning animals do , by these things they are destroyed .
65001011	Woe to them ! For they have gone the way of Cain , and for the sake of gain they have rushed headlong into the Balaam's error , and perished in Korah's rebellion .
65001012	These are the men who are blemishes in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear , caring for themselves ; clouds without water , carried along by winds ; autumn trees without fruit , twice dead , uprooted ;
65001013	wild waves of the sea , casting up their own shame like foam ; wandering stars , for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever .
65001014	It was also about these men that Enoch , in the seventh generation from Adam , prophesied , saying , » Behold , the Lord came with many thousands of his holy ones ,
65001015	to execute judgment on all , and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way , and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him . «
65001016	These are grumblers , finding fault , following after their own lusts ; they speak arrogantly , flattering people for their own advantage .
65001017	But you must remember , beloved , the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
65001018	they said to you , » In the last time there will be scoffers , following their own ungodly lusts . «
65001019	These are the ones who cause divisions , worldly-minded , devoid of the Spirit .
65001020	But you , beloved , build yourselves up on your most holy faith ; pray in the Holy Spirit ;
65001021	keep yourselves in the love of God ; wait anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life .
65001022	And have mercy on some , who doubt ;
65001023	save others , snatching them out of the fire ; and on some have mercy with fear , hating even the garment polluted by the flesh .
65001024	Now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you without blemish before the presence of his glory with great joy ,
65001025	to the only God our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory , majesty , dominion , and authority , before all time and now and forever . Amen .
66001001	The revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants what must soon take place . And he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John ,
66001002	who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ , even to all that he saw .
66001003	Blessed is he who reads the words of this prophecy , and blessed are those who hear , and who keep what is written in it ; for the time is near .
66001004	John , to the seven churches which are in Asia : grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come , and from the seven spirits who are before his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , the firstborn from the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood ,
66001006	and has made us a kingdom and priests to his God and Father , to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
66001007	
66001008	» I am the Alpha and the Omega , « says the Lord God , » who is , and who was , and who is to come , the Almighty . «
66001009	I , John , your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus , was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus .
66001010	I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day , and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet ,
66001011	saying , » Write in a book what you see , and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea . «
66001012	Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me . And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands ,
66001013	and in the midst of the lampstands one like a Son of Man , clothed with a robe down to the feet and girded round his chest with a golden band .
66001014	His head and hair were white like wool , as white as snow , and his eyes were like a flame of fire ;
66001015	his feet were like burnished bronze , refined as in a furnace , and his voice was like the sound of many waters ;
66001016	he held in his right hand seven stars , out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword , and his face was like the sun shining in its strength .
66001017	And when I saw him , I fell at his feet as though dead . But he laid his right hand on me , saying , » Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last ,
66001018	and the Living One ; I was dead , and behold , I am alive for evermore ! And I have the keys of death and Hades .
66001019	Write , therefore , what you have seen , what is now and what will take place after this .
66001020	The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lampstands : the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .
66002001	» To the angel of the church in Ephesus write : ‘ These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand , who walks among the seven golden lampstands :
66002002	I know your works , your toil and your patient endurance . I know that you cannot bear evil men , but you have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not , and have found them to be false ;
66002003	I know you have persevered and have endured for my name's sake , and you have not grown weary .
66002004	But I have this against you , that you have left your first love .
66002005	Remember then from where you have fallen , repent and do the works you did at first . If not , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place , unless you repent .
66002006	But this you have , that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
66002007	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who overcomes , I will give the right to eat from the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of God . ’
66002008	» And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write : ‘ These are the words of the First and the Last , who died , and came to life :
66002009	I know your tribulation and your poverty ( but you are rich ) and I know the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Do not fear what you are about to suffer . Behold , the devil is about to throw some of you into prison , that you may be tested , and for ten days you will have tribulation . Be faithful even until death , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death . ’
66002012	» And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write : ‘ These are the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword :
66002013	I know your works , and where you dwell , where Satan's throne is . And you hold fast to my name , and did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness , who was killed among you , where Satan dwells .
66002014	But I have a few things against you : you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel , to eat food sacrificed to idols and to practice sexual immorality .
66002015	So you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	Repent therefore , or else I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna . And I will give him a white stone , with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him who receives it . ’
66002018	» And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write : ‘ These are the words of the Son of God , who has eyes like a flame of fire , and whose feet are like burnished bronze :
66002019	I know your works , your love and faith , your service and perseverance , and that your works are now more than at the first .
66002020	Nevertheless I have this against you , that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I gave her time to repent , but she refuses to repent of her immorality .
66002022	So I will cast her on a sickbed , and I will throw those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation , unless they repent of her ways .
66002023	And I will strike her children dead . And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches minds and hearts , and I will give to each of you according to your works .
66002024	But to the rest of you in Thyatira , who do not hold this teaching , who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan , to you I say , I will not lay upon you any other burden ;
66002025	only hold fast what you have until I come .
66002026	He who overcomes , and keeps my works until the end , to him I will give power over the nations —
66002027	
66002028	— just as I also have received from my Father ; and I will give him the morning star .
66002029	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’
66003001	» And to the angel of the church in Sardis write : ‘ These are the words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars : I know your works ; you have a name of being alive , but you are dead .
66003002	Wake up , and strengthen what remains and is about to die , for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God .
66003003	Remember therefore what you have received and heard ; keep it , and repent . But if you will not wake up , I will come like a thief , and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you .
66003004	Yet you have a few names in Sardis , people who have not soiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
66003005	He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments , and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life ; but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels .
66003006	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’
66003007	» And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write : ‘ These are the words of him who is holy , who is true , who has the key of David , who opens and no one shuts , and shuts and no one opens :
66003008	I know your works . See , I have set before you an open door , and no one can shut it . I know that you have little strength , yet you have kept my word , and have not denied my name .
66003009	Behold , I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not , but lie — look , I will make them come and bow down before your feet , and know that I have loved you .
66003010	Because you have kept my command to persevere , I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
66003011	I am coming soon ; hold fast to what you have , so that no one may take your crown .
66003012	He who overcomes , I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall never go out of it . And I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the New Jerusalem , which comes down out of heaven from my God . And I will write on him my new name .
66003013	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’
66003014	» And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write : ‘ These are the words of the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of God’s creation :
66003015	I know your works , that you are neither cold nor hot . I could wish you were cold or hot !
66003016	So then , because you are lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spit you out of my mouth .
66003017	You say , » I am rich ; I have become wealthy , and have need of nothing « — and do not know that you are wretched , miserable , poor , blind , and naked ,
66003018	Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire , that you may be rich ; and white garments to clothe you , and to keep the shame of your nakedness from being seen ; and salve to anoint your eyes , that you may see .
66003019	Those whom I love , I rebuke and chasten . So be zealous and repent .
66003020	Behold , I stand at the door and knock . If any one hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in to him and eat with him , and he with me .
66003021	To him who overcomes , I will grant to sit with me on my throne , as I also overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	He who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’ «
66004001	After this I looked , and behold , a door standing open in heaven . And the voice , which I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said , » Come up here , and I will show you what must take place after this . «
66004002	At once I was in the Spirit ; and behold , a throne was standing in heaven , with one sitting on the throne .
66004003	And he who sat there was like jasper and carnelian in appearance , and round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald .
66004004	Round the throne were twenty-four thrones , and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders , clothed in white garments , and golden crowns on their heads .
66004005	From the throne come flashes of lightning , and voices and peals of thunder . And before the throne were seven lamps of fire , which are the seven spirits of God ;
66004006	and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass , like crystal . And in the center , around the throne , are four living creatures , full of eyes in front and behind .
66004007	The first living creature was like a lion , the second creature like an ox , the third creature had a face like that of a man , and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle .
66004008	And the four living creatures , each of them with six wings , are full of eyes all around and within , and day and night they never cease to sing , » Holy , holy , holy , is the Lord God Almighty , who was and is and is to come . «
66004009	And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne , who lives for ever and ever ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever ; they cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
66004011	
66005001	I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back , sealed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , » Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? «
66005003	And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it .
66005004	And I wept greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , » Weep not ; behold , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has conquered , so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals . «
66005006	And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders , I saw a Lamb standing , as if it had been slain , with seven horns and with seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth .
66005007	And he came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
66005008	And when he had taken the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb , each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
66005009	And they sang a new song , saying , » Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals ; for you were slain , and with your blood purchased men for God from every tribe and tongue and people and nation .
66005010	
66005011	Then I looked , and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders , numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands ,
66005012	saying with a loud voice , » Worthy is the Lamb who was slain , to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing ! «
66005013	And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea , and all that is in them , saying , » To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power , for ever and ever ! «
66005014	And the four living creatures said , » Amen ! « And the elders fell down and worshipped .
66006001	Then I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals . And I heard one of the four living creatures say , as with a voice of thunder , » Come ! «
66006002	I looked , and behold , a white horse , and its rider had a bow ; and a crown was given to him , and he went out conquering and to conquer .
66006003	When he opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , » Come ! «
66006004	And out came a horse , bright red ; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth , so that men should slay one another ; and to him was given a great sword .
66006005	When he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , » Come . « And I looked , and behold , a black horse ; and its rider had a pair of scales in his hand .
66006006	And I heard what sounded like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying , » A quart of wheat for a denarius , and three quarts of barley for a denarius ; and do not damage the oil and the wine ! «
66006007	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , » Come ! «
66006008	I looked , and behold , a pale horse ; and its rider's name was Death , and Hades was following him . And they were given power over a fourth of the earth , to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth .
66006009	When he opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained ;
66006010	they cried out with a loud voice , » O Sovereign Lord , holy and true , how long before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? «
66006011	Then each of them were given a white robe , and they were told to rest a little longer , until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren should be completed , who were to be killed as they had been .
66006012	I looked when he opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair , and the whole moon became like blood ;
66006013	and the stars of the sky fell to the earth , as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind .
66006014	The sky vanished like a scroll that is rolled up , and every mountain and island was removed from its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong , and every one , slave and free , hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains ,
66006016	and they said to the mountains and to the rocks , » Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb ;
66006017	for the great day of their wrath has come , and who can stand ? «
66007001	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds of the earth , that no wind would blow on the earth or the sea or on any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel ascend from the rising of the sun , having the seal of the living God , and he called out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the earth and sea ,
66007003	saying , » Do not harm the earth , the sea , or the trees until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads . «
66007004	And I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel :
66007005	
66007006	
66007007	
66007008	
66007009	After this I looked , and behold , a great multitude which no one could count , from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues , standing before the throne and before the Lamb , clothed in white robes , and palm branches were in their hands ;
66007010	and they cry out with a loud voice , saying , » Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb . «
66007011	And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God ,
66007012	saying , » Amen ! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God for ever and ever ! Amen . «
66007013	Then one of the elders addressed me , saying , » Who are these , clothed in white robes , and where have they come from ? «
66007014	I said to him , » Sir , you know . « And he said to me , » These are they who have come out of the great tribulation ; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	
66007016	
66007017	
66008001	When the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and to them were given seven trumpets .
66008003	Another angel , who had a golden censer , came and stood at the altar . And he was given much incense to offer , with the prayers of all the saints , on the golden altar before the throne .
66008004	And the smoke of the incense , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God from the angel's hand .
66008005	Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth ; and there were peals of thunder , voices , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake .
66008006	The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them .
66008007	The first angel sounded his trumpet , and there came hail and fire , mixed with blood , and they were thrown to the earth ; and a third of the earth was burned up , and a third of the trees were burned up , and all the green grass was burned up .
66008008	The second angel sounded his trumpet , and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea ; and a third of the sea became blood ,
66008009	and a third of the living creatures in the sea died ; and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	The third angel sounded his trumpet , and a great star fell from heaven , blazing like a torch , and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
66008011	The name of the star is Wormwood . A third of the waters became Wormwood , and many men died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
66008012	The fourth angel sounded his trumpet , and a third of the sun was struck , a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that a third of them darkened . And a third of the day was without light , and also a third of the night .
66008013	Then I looked , and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven , saying with a loud voice , » Woe , woe , woe to those who dwell on the earth , because of the blasts of the other trumpets of the three angels who are about to sound ! «
66009001	And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet , and I saw a star which had fallen from heaven to earth ; and he was given the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit .
66009002	He opened the bottomless pit , and smoke went up from the pit , like the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit .
66009003	Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth , and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth .
66009004	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree , but only those of mankind who have not the seal of God on their foreheads .
66009005	They were allowed to torture them for five months , but not to kill them , and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion , when it stings a man .
66009006	And in those days men will seek death and will not find it ; they will long to die , and death will fly from them .
66009007	In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle . On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold ; and their faces were like human faces ,
66009008	their hair was like women's hair , and their teeth were like lions' teeth .
66009009	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle .
66009010	They have tails like scorpions , and stings , and their power to hurt men for five months lies in their tails .
66009011	They have as king over them the angel of the abyss ; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in Greek he has the name Apollyon .
66009012	The first woe is past ; behold , two woes are still to come .
66009013	Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
66009014	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , » Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates . «
66009015	And the four angels , who had been held ready for the hour and day and month and year , were released to kill a third of mankind .
66009016	The number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million ; I heard their number .
66009017	And this was how I saw the horses in my vision : the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur , and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions , and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulfur .
66009018	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues , by the fire and the smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails ; for their tails are like serpents and have heads , and with them they do harm .
66009020	The rest of mankind , who were not killed by these plagues , did not repent of the works of their hands nor give up worshipping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk ;
66009021	nor did they repent of their murders , their sorceries , their sexual immorality or their thefts .
66010001	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven , wrapped in a cloud , with a rainbow over his head ; and his face was like the sun , and his legs like pillars of fire .
66010002	He had a little scroll which was open in his hand . And he set his right foot on the sea , and his left foot on the land ,
66010003	and he cried out with a loud voice , like the roar of a lion . When he shouted , the voices of the seven thunders spoke .
66010004	And when the seven thunders had sounded , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from heaven saying , » Seal up what the seven thunders have said , and do not write it down . «
66010005	Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to heaven ,
66010006	
66010007	but in the days of the trumpet of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God will be finished , as he announced to his servants the prophets .
66010008	Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again , saying , » Go , take the scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . «
66010009	So I went to the angel , telling him to give me the little scroll . And he said to me , » Take it and eat it ; it will make your stomach bitter , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey . «
66010010	I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it , and in my mouth it was sweet as honey ; but when I had eaten it , my stomach was made bitter .
66010011	And I was told , » You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings . «
66011001	Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff , and I was told , » Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there .
66011002	But leave out the court outside the temple and do not measure it , for it has been given over to the nations ; and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months .
66011003	And I will grant power to my two witnesses , and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth . «
66011004	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	And if anyone wants to harm them , fire flows out from their mouth and devours their enemies ; so if anyone wants to harm them , he must be killed in this way .
66011006	These have the power to shut up the sky , so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying ; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every plague , as often as they desire .
66011007	When they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war with them , and overcome them and kill them .
66011008	And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	For three days and a half men from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb .
66011010	And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate ; and they will send gifts to one another , because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth .
66011011	But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them , and they stood up on their feet , and great fear fell on those who saw them .
66011012	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , » Come up here . « And they went up to heaven in a cloud , while their enemies looked on .
66011013	And at that hour there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell ; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second woe has passed ; behold , the third woe is coming soon .
66011015	Then the seventh angel sounded his trumpet , and there were loud voices in heaven , saying , » The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ , and he will reign for ever and ever . «
66011016	And the twenty-four elders , who sit on their thrones before God , fell on their faces and worshipped God ,
66011017	saying , » We give thanks to you , O Lord God , the Almighty , who is and who was , because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign .
66011018	
66011019	Then God's temple in heaven was opened , and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant ; and there were flashes of lightning , voices , peals of thunder , an earthquake and a great hailstorm .
66012001	A great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and with the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars ;
66012002	and she was with child , and she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth .
66012003	Then another sign appeared in heaven : and behold , a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads were seven diadems .
66012004	And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven , and threw them to the earth . And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that he might devour her child when it was born .
66012005	And she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron ; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne .
66012006	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she has a place prepared by God , in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days .
66012007	And there was war in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back ,
66012008	but they were not strong enough , and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven .
66012009	And the great dragon was thrown down , that ancient serpent , who is called the Devil and Satan , the deceiver of the whole world — he was thrown down to the earth , and his angels were thrown down with him .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven , saying , » Now the salvation , and the power , and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come , for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down , who accuses them before our God day and night .
66012011	
66012012	
66012013	And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth , he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child .
66012014	But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle , so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place , where she is to be nourished for a time and times and half a time , from the presence of the serpent .
66012015	And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman , to sweep her away with the flood .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth .
66012017	Then the dragon was enraged with the woman , and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring , on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus .
66013001	And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea . And I saw a beast coming out of the sea . He had ten horns and seven heads , with ten diadems on his horns , and on his heads were blasphemous names .
66013002	The beast that I saw was like a leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority .
66013003	One of its heads seemed to have a fatal wound , but its fatal wound was healed , and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder .
66013004	Men worshipped the dragon , because he had given his authority to the beast , and they worshipped the beast , saying , » Who is like the beast , and who can make war against him ? «
66013005	And the beast was given a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies , and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months .
66013006	And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God , to blaspheme his name and his dwelling , that is , those who dwell in heaven .
66013007	Also it was given power to make war on the saints and to conquer them . And authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation ,
66013008	and all who dwell on earth will worship it , every one whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain .
66013009	If anyone has an ear , let him hear .
66013010	
66013011	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon .
66013012	He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence , and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
66013013	He performs great signs , even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men .
66013014	And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which he was given power to do in the presence of the beast . He ordered them to make an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived .
66013015	And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak , and to cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
66013016	And he causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to be given a mark on their right hand or the forehead ,
66013017	so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of his name .
66013018	This calls for wisdom . Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man ; its number is six hundred and sixty-six .
66014001	Then I looked , and behold , the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion , and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads .
66014002	I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder , and the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps .
66014003	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders . No one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth .
66014004	These are the ones who have not been defiled with women , for they have kept themselves chaste . These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb .
66014005	And no lie was found in their mouth ; they are blameless .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven , having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth , and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people ;
66014007	and he said with a loud voice , » Fear God , and give him glory , because the hour of his judgment has come ; worship him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of water . «
66014008	And another angel , a second , followed , saying , » Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , she who made all the nations drink the wine of her impure passion . «
66014009	And another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a loud voice , » If any one worships the beast and its image , and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ,
66014010	he also will drink of the wine of God’s wrath , which is poured in full strength into the cup of his anger , and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb .
66014011	And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever ; they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name . «
66014012	Here is a call for the endurance of the saints , those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus .
66014013	And I heard a voice from heaven , saying , » Write , ‘ Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on ! ’ « » Yes , « says the Spirit , » that they may rest from their labors , for their deeds follow them . «
66014014	Then I looked , and behold , a white cloud , and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man , with a golden crown on his head , and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	And another angel came out of the temple , crying out with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , » Put in your sickle and reap , for the hour to reap has come , because the harvest of the earth is ripe . «
66014016	So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was reaped .
66014017	And another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he too had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Then another angel came out from the altar , the one who has power over fire , and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle , » Put in your sharp sickle , and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth , because its grapes are ripe . «
66014019	So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth , and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God .
66014020	And the wine press was trodden outside the city , and blood flowed from the wine press , as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia .
66015001	Then I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvelous , seven angels with seven plagues , which are the last , because with them the wrath of God is finished .
66015002	And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and , standing beside the sea of glass , those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name . They held harps of God
66015003	and they sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , » Great and marvelous are your deeds , O Lord God the Almighty ! Just and true are your ways , O King of the ages !
66015004	
66015005	After this I looked , and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened ,
66015006	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple , clothed in linen , clean and bright , and girded around their chests with golden sashes .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives for ever and ever .
66015008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power , and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple , saying to the seven angels , » Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God . «
66016002	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth , and foul and loathsome sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshipped his image .
66016003	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea , and it became blood like that of a dead man , and every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water , and they became blood .
66016005	And I heard the angel of the waters say , » Righteous are you , who are and who were , O Holy One , because you judged these things ;
66016006	
66016007	And I heard the altar saying , » Yes , O Lord God , the Almighty , true and just are your judgments . «
66016008	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to it to scorch men with fire .
66016009	Men were scorched by the fierce heat , and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues , and they did not repent and give him glory .
66016010	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was plunged into darkness ; men gnawed their tongues in agony
66016011	and they cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores , and they did not repent of their deeds .
66016012	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates , and its water was dried up , to prepare the way for the kings from the East .
66016013	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits like frogs ;
66016014	for they are spirits of demons , performing miraculous signs , and they go out to the kings of the whole world , to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty .
66016015	( » Behold , I am coming like a thief ! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him , so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed . « )
66016016	And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon .
66016017	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air , and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne , saying , » It is done ! «
66016018	And there were flashes of lightning and voices and peals of thunder ; and there was a great earthquake , such as there had not been since man came to be on the earth , so great an earthquake was it , and so mighty .
66016019	The great city was split into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . Babylon the great was remembered before God , to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath .
66016020	And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
66016021	Huge hailstones , about a hundred pounds each , fell from heaven upon men . And men cursed God for the plague of hail , because the plague was so terrible .
66017001	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me , » Come , I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters ,
66017002	with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication . «
66017003	And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness , and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of blasphemous names , and it had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls , having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality ,
66017005	And on her forehead was written a name of mystery , » BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH . «
66017006	And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus . When I saw her , I wondered greatly .
66017007	And the angel said to me , » Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
66017008	The beast that you saw was , and is not , and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction . And those who dwell on the earth , whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , will wonder when they see the beast , because he was and is not and will come .
66017009	This calls for a mind with wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits .
66017010	And they are also seven kings ; five have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come ; and when he comes , he must remain a little while .
66017011	The beast who was , and is not , is an eighth . He belongs to the seven and he goes to destruction .
66017012	And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings , who have not yet received a kingdom , but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour .
66017013	These have one purpose and they give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	These will make war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will overcome them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings , and those who are with him are the called and chosen and faithful . «
66017015	And he said to me , » The waters you saw where the harlot sits , are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues .
66017016	And the ten horns you saw , they and the beast will hate the harlot ; they will make her desolate and naked , and will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire ,
66017017	for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
66017018	The woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth . «
66018001	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven , having great authority ; and the earth was made bright with his splendor .
66018002	And he called out with a mighty voice , » Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She has become a dwelling place of demons , a haunt of every unclean spirit , a haunt of every unclean and hateful bird .
66018003	
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven , saying , » Come out of her , my people , so that you will not share in her sins and receive of her plagues ;
66018005	
66018006	
66018007	
66018008	
66018009	And the kings of the earth , who committed fornication and were wanton with her , will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning ;
66018010	they will stand far off , in fear of her torment , and say , ‘ Woe , woe , the great city , the mighty city , Babylon ! In one hour has your judgment come . ’
66018011	And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her , because no one buys their cargoes any more —
66018012	cargoes of gold , silver , precious stones and pearls ; fine linen , purple , silk and scarlet cloth ; every sort of citron wood , and articles of every kind made of ivory , costly wood , bronze , iron and marble ;
66018013	cargoes of cinnamon and spice , of incense , myrrh and frankincense , of wine and olive oil , of fine flour and wheat ; cattle and sheep ; horses and chariots ; and slaves and human souls .
66018014	
66018015	The merchants of these things , who gained wealth from her , will stand far off , in fear of her torment , weeping and mourning ,
66018016	saying , ‘ Woe , woe , the great city , she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls !
66018017	
66018018	and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , ‘ What city is like the great city ? ’
66018019	And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out , weeping and mourning , saying , ‘ Woe , woe , the great city , where all who had ships at sea became rich by her wealth , for in one hour she has been laid waste ! ’
66018020	
66018021	Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea , saying , » So will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down with violence , and will not be found any longer .
66018022	
66018023	
66018024	
66019001	After this I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven , crying , » Hallelujah ! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God ,
66019002	
66019003	And again they shouted , » Hallelujah ! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever . «
66019004	And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who is seated on the throne , saying , » Amen . Hallelujah ! «
66019005	And a voice came from the throne , saying , » Praise our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , both small and great . «
66019006	Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a great multitude , like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder , crying , » Hallelujah ! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns .
66019007	
66019008	
66019009	Then the angel said to me , » Write , ‘ Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb . ’ « And he said to me , » These are true words of God . «
66019010	Then I fell at his feet to worship him , but he said to me , » You must not do that ! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus . Worship God . For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . «
66019011	Then I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse ! He who sat on it is called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he judges and makes war .
66019012	His eyes are like a flame of fire , and on his head are many diadems ; and he has a name written on him which no one knows but himself .
66019013	He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood , and his name is called the Word of God .
66019014	The armies of heaven were following him , riding on white horses , and dressed in fine linen , white and clean .
66019015	From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations , and he will rule them with a rod of iron ; he treads the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty .
66019016	And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written , KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS .
66019017	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and with a loud voice he cried to all the birds that fly in midheaven , » Come , gather for the great supper of God ,
66019018	so that you may eat the flesh of kings , the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , the flesh of horses and their riders , and the flesh of all men , both free and slave , both small and great . «
66019019	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who sits on the horse and against his army .
66019020	And the beast was captured , and with him the false prophet who had performed the signs in his presence , by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image . These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with sulfur .
66019021	And the rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of him who sat on the horse , and all the birds were gorged with their flesh .
66020001	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a great chain .
66020002	And he seized the dragon , that ancient serpent , who is the Devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years ,
66020003	and he threw him into the abyss , and shut it and sealed it over him , so that he would not deceive the nations any more , until the thousand years were ended . After these things he must be released for a short time .
66020004	Then I saw thrones , and seated on them were those to whom judgment was given . Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony to Jesus and because of the word of God , and who had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands . They came to life , and reigned with Christ a thousand years .
66020005	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended . This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection ; over these the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years .
66020007	When the thousand years are ended , Satan will be released from his prison
66020008	and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth , that is , Gog and Magog , to gather them for battle ; their number is like the sand of the seashore .
66020009	And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city , but fire came down from heaven and devoured them .
66020010	And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were , and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it ; from his presence earth and sky fled away , and no place was found for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne , and books were opened . Also another book was opened , which is the book of life . And the dead were judged by what was written in the books , according to what they had done .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead which were in it , and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them , and all were judged according to what they had done .
66020014	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death , the lake of fire .
66020015	And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life , he was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth ; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away , and there was no longer any sea .
66021002	And I saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying , » Behold , the dwelling of God is with men . And he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself will be with them ;
66021004	he will wipe away every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more , neither will there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more , for the former things have passed away . «
66021005	And he who sits on the throne said , » Behold , I am making all things new . « And he said , » Write this , for these words are trustworthy and true . «
66021006	Then he said to me , » It is done . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end . I will give to the one who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life without cost .
66021007	He who overcomes will inherit all this , and I will be his God and he will be my son .
66021008	But as for the cowardly , the unbelieving , the immoral , as for murderers , fornicators , sorcerers , idolaters , and all liars , their lot will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . «
66021009	Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues , and spoke to me , saying , » Come , I will show you the Bride , the wife of the Lamb . «
66021010	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain , and showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God ,
66021011	having the glory of God , and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel , like a jasper , clear as crystal .
66021012	It had a great , high wall , with twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel .
66021013	There were three gates on the east , three gates on the north , three gates on the south , and three gates on the west .
66021014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	The one who talked with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city , and its gates and its walls .
66021016	The city is laid out as a square , and its length is as great as the width ; and he measured the city with the rod , twelve thousand stadia ; its length and width and height are equal .
66021017	He also measured its wall , a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man's measure , which is also an angel's .
66021018	The wall was made of jasper , and the city of pure gold , as clear as glass .
66021019	The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone . The first foundation was jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	the fifth sardonyx , the sixth carnelian , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , and the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls , each of the gates made of a single pearl . And the street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
66021022	And I saw no temple in the city , for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple .
66021023	And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it , for the glory of God gives it light , and its lamp is the Lamb .
66021024	The nations will walk by its light , and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it .
66021025	In the daytime ( for there will be no night there ) its gates will never be shut ;
66021026	they will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations .
66021027	Nothing unclean shall enter it , nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood , but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life .
66022001	Then he showed me the river of the water of life , clear as crystal , flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb ,
66022002	through the middle of the street of the city ; also , on either side of the river , the tree of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit , yielding its fruit every month . And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
66022003	There will no longer be any curse ; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it , and his servants will serve him .
66022004	They will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	And there will be no more night . They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , for the Lord God will give them light ; and they will reign for ever and ever .
66022006	And he said to me , » These words are trustworthy and true . And the Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , has sent his angel to show his servants the things which must soon take place . «
66022007	» And behold , I am coming soon . Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book . «
66022008	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . And when I heard and saw them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me .
66022009	But he said to me , » Do not do that ! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets , and with those who keep the words of this book . Worship God . «
66022010	And he said to me , » Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book , for the time is near .
66022011	He who does wrong , let him do wrong still ; and he who is filthy , let him be filthy still ; and he who does right , let him do right still ; and he who is holy , let him be holy still . «
66022012	» Behold , I am coming soon , and my reward is with me , to render to every man according to what he has done .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the first and the last , the beginning and the end . «
66022014	Blessed are those who wash their robes , so that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter by the gates into the city .
66022015	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters , and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
66022016	» I , Jesus , have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches . I am the Root and the Offspring of David , the bright Morning Star . «
66022017	The Spirit and the Bride say , » Come . « And let him who hears say , » Come . « And let him who is thirsty come ; let him who wishes take the water of life without price .
66022018	I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book : if anyone adds to them , God will add to him the plagues described in this book ,
66022019	and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city , which are described in this book .
66022020	He who testifies to these things says , » Yes , I am coming soon . « Amen . Come , Lord Jesus .
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all . Amen .
