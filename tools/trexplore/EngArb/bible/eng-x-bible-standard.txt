40001001	The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac , and Isaac the father of Jacob , and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers ,
40001003	and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar , and Perez the father of Hezron , and Hezron the father of Ram ,
40001004	and Ram the father of Amminadab , and Amminadab the father of Nahshon , and Nahshon the father of Salmon ,
40001005	and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab , and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth , and Obed the father of Jesse ,
40001006	and Jesse the father of David the king . And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah ,
40001007	and Solomon the father of Rehoboam , and Rehoboam the father of Abijah , and Abijah the father of Asaph ,
40001008	and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat , and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram , and Joram the father of Uzziah ,
40001009	and Uzziah the father of Jotham , and Jotham the father of Ahaz , and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah ,
40001010	and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh , and Manasseh the father of Amos , and Amos the father of Josiah ,
40001011	and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers , at the time of the deportation to Babylon .
40001012	And after the deportation to Babylon : Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel , and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel ,
40001013	and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud , and Abiud the father of Eliakim , and Eliakim the father of Azor ,
40001014	and Azor the father of Zadok , and Zadok the father of Achim , and Achim the father of Eliud ,
40001015	and Eliud the father of Eleazar , and Eleazar the father of Matthan , and Matthan the father of Jacob ,
40001016	and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom Jesus was born , who is called Christ .
40001017	So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations , and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations , and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way . When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit .
40001019	And her husband Joseph , being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame , resolved to divorce her quietly .
40001020	But as he considered these things , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , “ Joseph , son of David , do not fear to take Mary as your wife , for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will bear a son , and you shall call his name Jesus , for he will save his people from their sins . ”
40001022	All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet :
40001023	“ Behold , the virgin shall conceive and bear a son , and they shall call his name Immanuel ” ( which means , God with us ) .
40001024	When Joseph woke from sleep , he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him : he took his wife ,
40001025	but knew her not until she had given birth to a son . And he called his name Jesus .
40002001	Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king , behold , wise men from the east came to Jerusalem ,
40002002	saying , “ Where is he who has been born king of the Jews ? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him . ”
40002003	When Herod the king heard this , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him ;
40002004	and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born .
40002005	They told him , “ In Bethlehem of Judea , for so it is written by the prophet :
40002006	“ ‘ And you , O Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , are by no means least among the rulers of Judah ; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel . ’ ”
40002007	Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared .
40002008	And he sent them to Bethlehem , saying , “ Go and search diligently for the child , and when you have found him , bring me word , that I too may come and worship him . ”
40002009	After listening to the king , they went on their way . And behold , the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy .
40002011	And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother , and they fell down and worshiped him . Then , opening their treasures , they offered him gifts , gold and frankincense and myrrh .
40002012	And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod , they departed to their own country by another way .
40002013	Now when they had departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Rise , take the child and his mother , and flee to Egypt , and remain there until I tell you , for Herod is about to search for the child , to destroy him . ”
40002014	And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt
40002015	and remained there until the death of Herod . This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet , “ Out of Egypt I called my son . ”
40002016	Then Herod , when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men , became furious , and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under , according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men .
40002017	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah :
40002018	“ A voice was heard in Ramah , weeping and loud lamentation , Rachel weeping for her children ; she refused to be comforted , because they are no more . ”
40002019	But when Herod died , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
40002020	saying , “ Rise , take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel , for those who sought the child’s life are dead . ”
40002021	And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there , and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee .
40002023	And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth , that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled : “ He shall be called a Nazarene . ”
40003001	In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea ,
40003002	“ Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . ”
40003003	For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare the way of the Lord ; make his paths straight . ’ ”
40003004	Now John wore a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist , and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him ,
40003006	and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
40003007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said to them , “ You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
40003008	Bear fruit in keeping with repentance .
40003009	And do not presume to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father , ’ for I tell you , God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham .
40003010	Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees . Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40003011	“ I baptize you with water for repentance , but he who is coming after me is mightier than I , whose sandals I am not worthy to carry . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
40003012	His winnowing fork is in his hand , and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn , but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire . ”
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John , to be baptized by him .
40003014	John would have prevented him , saying , “ I need to be baptized by you , and do you come to me ? ”
40003015	But Jesus answered him , “ Let it be so now , for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness . ” Then he consented .
40003016	And when Jesus was baptized , immediately he went up from the water , and behold , the heavens were opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him ;
40003017	and behold , a voice from heaven said , “ This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . ”
40004001	Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	And after fasting forty days and forty nights , he was hungry .
40004003	And the tempter came and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , command these stones to become loaves of bread . ”
40004004	But he answered , “ It is written , “ ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that comes from the mouth of God . ’ ”
40004005	Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple
40004006	and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down , for it is written , “ ‘ He will command his angels concerning you , ’ and “ ‘ On their hands they will bear you up , lest you strike your foot against a stone . ’ ”
40004007	Jesus said to him , “ Again it is written , ‘ You shall not put the Lord your God to the test . ’ ”
40004008	Again , the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory .
40004009	And he said to him , “ All these I will give you , if you will fall down and worship me . ”
40004010	Then Jesus said to him , “ Be gone , Satan ! For it is written , “ ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve . ’ ”
40004011	Then the devil left him , and behold , angels came and were ministering to him .
40004012	Now when he heard that John had been arrested , he withdrew into Galilee .
40004013	And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea , in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
40004014	so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled :
40004015	“ The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , the way of the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles —
40004016	the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light , and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death , on them a light has dawned . ”
40004017	From that time Jesus began to preach , saying , “ Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . ”
40004018	While walking by the Sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon ( who is called Peter
40004019	And he said to them , “ Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men . ”
40004020	Immediately they left their nets and followed him .
40004021	And going on from there he saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets , and he called them .
40004022	Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him .
40004023	And he went throughout all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people .
40004024	So his fame spread throughout all Syria , and they brought him all the sick , those afflicted with various diseases and pains , those oppressed by demons , epileptics , and paralytics , and he healed them .
40004025	And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis , and from Jerusalem and Judea , and from beyond the Jordan .
40005001	Seeing the crowds , he went up on the mountain , and when he sat down , his disciples came to him .
40005002	And he opened his mouth and taught them , saying :
40005003	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005004	“ Blessed are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted .
40005005	“ Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth .
40005006	“ Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness , for they shall be satisfied .
40005007	“ Blessed are the merciful , for they shall receive mercy .
40005008	“ Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God .
40005009	“ Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God .
40005010	“ Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness ’ sake , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005011	“ Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account .
40005012	Rejoice and be glad , for your reward is great in heaven , for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	“ You are the salt of the earth , but if salt has lost its taste , how shall its saltiness be restored ? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people’s feet .
40005014	“ You are the light of the world . A city set on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket , but on a stand , and it gives light to all in the house .
40005016	In the same way , let your light shine before others , so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven .
40005017	“ Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets ; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them .
40005018	For truly , I say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not an iota , not a dot , will pass from the Law until all is accomplished .
40005019	Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven , but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I tell you , unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	“ You have heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not murder ; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment . ’
40005022	But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment ; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council ; and whoever says , ‘ You fool ! ’ will be liable to the hell of fire .
40005023	So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there before the altar and go . First be reconciled to your brother , and then come and offer your gift .
40005025	Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court , lest your accuser hand you over to the judge , and the judge to the guard , and you be put in prison .
40005026	Truly , I say to you , you will never get out until you have paid the last penny .
40005027	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall not commit adultery . ’
40005028	But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye causes you to sin , tear it out and throw it away . For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell .
40005030	And if your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell .
40005031	“ It was also said , ‘ Whoever divorces his wife , let him give her a certificate of divorce . ’
40005032	But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife , except on the ground of sexual immorality , makes her commit adultery , and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40005033	“ Again you have heard that it was said to those of old , ‘ You shall not swear falsely , but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn . ’
40005034	But I say to you , Do not take an oath at all , either by heaven , for it is the throne of God ,
40005035	or by the earth , for it is his footstool , or by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
40005036	And do not take an oath by your head , for you cannot make one hair white or black .
40005037	Let what you say be simply ‘ Yes’or ‘ No ’ ; anything more than this comes from evil .
40005038	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . ’
40005039	But I say to you , Do not resist the one who is evil . But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also .
40005040	And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic , let him have your cloak as well .
40005041	And if anyone forces you to go one mile , go with him two miles .
40005042	Give to the one who begs from you , and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you .
40005043	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
40005044	But I say to you , Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven . For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good , and sends rain on the just and on the unjust .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward do you have ? Do not even the tax collectors do the same ?
40005047	And if you greet only your brothers , what more are you doing than others ? Do not even the Gentiles do the same ?
40005048	You therefore must be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect .
40006001	“ Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them , for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
40006002	“ Thus , when you give to the needy , sound no trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may be praised by others . Truly , I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006003	But when you give to the needy , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your giving may be in secret . And your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40006005	“ And when you pray , you must not be like the hypocrites . For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners , that they may be seen by others . Truly , I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006006	But when you pray , go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret . And your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40006007	“ And when you pray , do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do , for they think that they will be heard for their many words .
40006008	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
40006009	Pray then like this : “ Our Father in heaven , hallowed be your name .
40006010	Your kingdom come , your will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	Give us this day our daily bread ,
40006012	and forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors .
40006013	And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
40006014	For if you forgive others their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you ,
40006015	but if you do not forgive others their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
40006016	“ And when you fast , do not look gloomy like the hypocrites , for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others . Truly , I say to you , they have received their reward .
40006017	But when you fast , anoint your head and wash your face ,
40006018	that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret . And your Father who sees in secret will reward you .
40006019	“ Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal ,
40006020	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal .
40006021	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
40006022	“ The eye is the lamp of the body . So , if your eye is healthy , your whole body will be full of light ,
40006023	but if your eye is bad , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the light in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
40006024	“ No one can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and money .
40006025	“ Therefore I tell you , do not be anxious about your life , what you will eat or what you will drink , nor about your body , what you will put on . Is not life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
40006026	Look at the birds of the air : they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not of more value than they ?
40006027	And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life ?
40006028	And why are you anxious about clothing ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow : they neither toil nor spin ,
40006029	yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
40006030	But if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , will he not much more clothe you , O you of little faith ?
40006031	Therefore do not be anxious , saying , ‘ What shall we eat ? ’ or ‘ What shall we drink ? ’ or ‘ What shall we wear ? ’
40006032	For the Gentiles seek after all these things , and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all .
40006033	But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these things will be added to you .
40006034	“ Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow , for tomorrow will be anxious for itself . Sufficient for the day is its own trouble .
40007001	“ Judge not , that you be not judged .
40007002	For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged , and with the measure you use it will be measured to you .
40007003	Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye , but do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
40007004	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me take the speck out of your eye , ’ when there is the log in your own eye ?
40007005	You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye .
40007006	“ Do not give dogs what is holy , and do not throw your pearls before pigs , lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you .
40007007	“ Ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks it will be opened .
40007009	Or which one of you , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
40007011	If you then , who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
40007012	“ So whatever you wish that others would do to you , do also to them , for this is the Law and the Prophets .
40007013	“ Enter by the narrow gate . For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction , and those who enter by it are many .
40007014	For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life , and those who find it are few .
40007015	“ Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves .
40007016	You will recognize them by their fruits . Are grapes gathered from thornbushes , or figs from thistles ?
40007017	So , every healthy tree bears good fruit , but the diseased tree bears bad fruit .
40007018	A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit , nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	Thus you will recognize them by their fruits .
40007021	“ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
40007022	On that day many will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and cast out demons in your name , and do many mighty works in your name ? ’
40007023	And then will I declare to them , ‘ I never knew you ; depart from me , you workers of lawlessness . ’
40007024	“ Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock .
40007025	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat on that house , but it did not fall , because it had been founded on the rock .
40007026	And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand .
40007027	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell , and great was the fall of it . ”
40007028	And when Jesus finished these sayings , the crowds were astonished at his teaching ,
40007029	for he was teaching them as one who had authority , and not as their scribes .
40008001	When he came down from the mountain , great crowds followed him .
40008002	And behold , a leper came to him and knelt before him , saying , “ Lord , if you will , you can make me clean . ”
40008003	And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I will ; be clean . ” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40008004	And Jesus said to him , “ See that you say nothing to anyone , but go , show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a proof to them . ”
40008005	When he entered Capernaum , a centurion came forward to him , appealing to him ,
40008006	“ Lord , my servant is lying paralyzed at home , suffering terribly . ”
40008007	And he said to him , “ I will come and heal him . ”
40008008	But the centurion replied , “ Lord , I am not worthy to have you come under my roof , but only say the word , and my servant will be healed .
40008009	For I too am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . And I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes , and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . ”
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he marveled and said to those who followed him , “ Truly , I tell you , with no one in Israel have I found such faith .
40008011	I tell you , many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven ,
40008012	while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40008013	And to the centurion Jesus said , “ Go ; let it be done for you as you have believed . ” And the servant was healed at that very moment .
40008014	And when Jesus entered Peter’s house , he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she rose and began to serve him .
40008016	That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons , and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick .
40008017	This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah : “ He took our illnesses and bore our diseases . ”
40008018	Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him , he gave orders to go over to the other side .
40008019	And a scribe came up and said to him , “ Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . ”
40008020	And Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . ”
40008021	Another of the disciples said to him , “ Lord , let me first go and bury my father . ”
40008022	And Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , and leave the dead to bury their own dead . ”
40008023	And when he got into the boat , his disciples followed him .
40008024	And behold , there arose a great storm on the sea , so that the boat was being swamped by the waves ; but he was asleep .
40008025	And they went and woke him , saying , “ Save us , Lord ; we are perishing . ”
40008026	And he said to them , “ Why are you afraid , O you of little faith ? ” Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm .
40008027	And the men marveled , saying , “ What sort of man is this , that even winds and sea obey him ? ”
40008028	And when he came to the other side , to the country of the Gadarenes , two demon-possessed men met him , coming out of the tombs , so fierce that no one could pass that way .
40008029	And behold , they cried out , “ What have you to do with us , O Son of God ? Have you come here to torment us before the time ? ”
40008030	Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them .
40008031	And the demons begged him , saying , “ If you cast us out , send us away into the herd of pigs . ”
40008032	And he said to them , “ Go . ” So they came out and went into the pigs , and behold , the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters .
40008033	The herdsmen fled , and going into the city they told everything , especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men .
40008034	And behold , all the city came out to meet Jesus , and when they saw him , they begged him to leave their region .
40009001	And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city .
40009002	And behold , some people brought to him a paralytic , lying on a bed . And when Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Take heart , my son ; your sins are forgiven . ”
40009003	And behold , some of the scribes said to themselves , “ This man is blaspheming . ”
40009004	But Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said , “ Why do you think evil in your hearts ?
40009005	For which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise and walk ’ ?
40009006	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” — he then said to the paralytic — “ Rise , pick up your bed and go home . ”
40009007	And he rose and went home .
40009008	When the crowds saw it , they were afraid , and they glorified God , who had given such authority to men .
40009009	As Jesus passed on from there , he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth , and he said to him , “ Follow me . ” And he rose and followed him .
40009010	And as Jesus reclined at table in the house , behold , many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	And when the Pharisees saw this , they said to his disciples , “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
40009012	But when he heard it , he said , “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick .
40009013	Go and learn what this means , ‘ I desire mercy , and not sacrifice . ’ For I came not to call the righteous , but sinners . ”
40009014	Then the disciples of John came to him , saying , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
40009015	And Jesus said to them , “ Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them ? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , for the patch tears away from the garment , and a worse tear is made .
40009017	Neither is new wine put into old wineskins . If it is , the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed . But new wine is put into fresh wineskins , and so both are preserved . ”
40009018	While he was saying these things to them , behold , a ruler came in and knelt before him , saying , “ My daughter has just died , but come and lay your hand on her , and she will live . ”
40009019	And Jesus rose and followed him , with his disciples .
40009020	And behold , a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment ,
40009021	for she said to herself , “ If I only touch his garment , I will be made well . ”
40009022	Jesus turned , and seeing her he said , “ Take heart , daughter ; your faith has made you well . ” And instantly the woman was made well .
40009023	And when Jesus came to the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion ,
40009024	he said , “ Go away , for the girl is not dead but sleeping . ” And they laughed at him .
40009025	But when the crowd had been put outside , he went in and took her by the hand , and the girl arose .
40009026	And the report of this went through all that district .
40009027	And as Jesus passed on from there , two blind men followed him , crying aloud , “ Have mercy on us , Son of David . ”
40009028	When he entered the house , the blind men came to him , and Jesus said to them , “ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ” They said to him , “ Yes , Lord . ”
40009029	Then he touched their eyes , saying , “ According to your faith be it done to you . ”
40009030	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus sternly warned them , “ See that no one knows about it . ”
40009031	But they went away and spread his fame through all that district .
40009032	As they were going away , behold , a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him .
40009033	And when the demon had been cast out , the mute man spoke . And the crowds marveled , saying , “ Never was anything like this seen in Israel . ”
40009034	But the Pharisees said , “ He casts out demons by the prince of demons . ”
40009035	And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction .
40009036	When he saw the crowds , he had compassion for them , because they were harassed and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , “ The harvest is plentiful , but the laborers are few ;
40009038	therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest . ”
40010001	And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every disease and every affliction .
40010002	The names of the twelve apostles are these : first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Cananaean , and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
40010005	These twelve Jesus sent out , instructing them , “ Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans ,
40010006	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	And proclaim as you go , saying , ‘ The kingdom of heaven is at hand . ’
40010008	Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse lepers , cast out demons . You received without paying ; give without pay .
40010009	Acquire no gold nor silver nor copper for your belts ,
40010010	no bag for your journey , nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff , for the laborer deserves his food .
40010011	And whatever town or village you enter , find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart .
40010012	As you enter the house , greet it .
40010013	And if the house is worthy , let your peace come upon it , but if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you .
40010014	And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words , shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town .
40010015	Truly , I say to you , it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town .
40010016	“ Behold , I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves , so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves .
40010017	Beware of men , for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues ,
40010018	and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake , to bear witness before them and the Gentiles .
40010019	When they deliver you over , do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say , for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour .
40010020	For it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	Brother will deliver brother over to death , and the father his child , and children will rise against parents and have them put to death ,
40010022	and you will be hated by all for my name’s sake . But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
40010023	When they persecute you in one town , flee to the next , for truly , I say to you , you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	“ A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his master .
40010025	It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher , and the servant like his master . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more will they malign those of his household .
40010026	“ So have no fear of them , for nothing is covered that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known .
40010027	What I tell you in the dark , say in the light , and what you hear whispered , proclaim on the housetops .
40010028	And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell .
40010029	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father .
40010030	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	Fear not , therefore ; you are of more value than many sparrows .
40010032	So everyone who acknowledges me before men , I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven ,
40010033	but whoever denies me before men , I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven .
40010034	“ Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth . I have not come to bring peace , but a sword .
40010035	For I have come to set a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
40010036	And a person’s enemies will be those of his own household .
40010037	Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me , and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
40010038	And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me .
40010039	Whoever finds his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it .
40010040	“ Whoever receives you receives me , and whoever receives me receives him who sent me .
40010041	The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward , and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward .
40010042	And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple , truly , I say to you , he will by no means lose his reward . ”
40011001	When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples , he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities .
40011002	Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ , he sent word by his disciples
40011003	and said to him , “ Are you the one who is to come , or shall we look for another ? ”
40011004	And Jesus answered them , “ Go and tell John what you hear and see :
40011005	the blind receive their sight and the lame walk , lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear , and the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news preached to them .
40011006	And blessed is the one who is not offended by me . ”
40011007	As they went away , Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40011008	What then did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Behold , those who wear soft clothing are in kings ’ houses .
40011009	What then did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	This is he of whom it is written , “ ‘ Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . ’
40011011	Truly , I say to you , among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist . Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence , and the violent take it by force .
40011013	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John ,
40011014	and if you are willing to accept it , he is Elijah who is to come .
40011015	He who has ears to hear , let him hear .
40011016	“ But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates ,
40011017	“ ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not mourn . ’
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look at him ! A glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds . ”
40011020	Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done , because they did not repent .
40011021	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	But I tell you , it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? You will be brought down to Hades . For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
40011024	But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you . ”
40011025	At that time Jesus declared , “ I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children ;
40011026	yes , Father , for such was your gracious will .
40011027	All things have been handed over to me by my Father , and no one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him .
40011028	Come to me , all who labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
40011030	For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . ”
40012001	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath . His disciples were hungry , and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat .
40012002	But when the Pharisees saw it , they said to him , “ Look , your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . ”
40012003	He said to them , “ Have you not read what David did when he was hungry , and those who were with him :
40012004	how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence , which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
40012005	Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless ?
40012006	I tell you , something greater than the temple is here .
40012007	And if you had known what this means , ‘ I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned the guiltless .
40012008	For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . ”
40012009	He went on from there and entered their synagogue .
40012010	And a man was there with a withered hand . And they asked him , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ” — so that they might accuse him .
40012011	He said to them , “ Which one of you who has a sheep , if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will not take hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	Of how much more value is a man than a sheep ! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath . ”
40012013	Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” And the man stretched it out , and it was restored , healthy like the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him , how to destroy him .
40012015	Jesus , aware of this , withdrew from there . And many followed him , and he healed them all
40012016	and ordered them not to make him known .
40012017	This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah :
40012018	“ Behold , my servant whom I have chosen , my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased . I will put my Spirit upon him , and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles .
40012019	He will not quarrel or cry aloud , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets ;
40012020	a bruised reed he will not break , and a smoldering wick he will not quench , until he brings justice to victory ;
40012021	and in his name the Gentiles will hope . ”
40012022	Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him , and he healed him , so that the man spoke and saw .
40012023	And all the people were amazed , and said , “ Can this be the Son of David ? ”
40012024	But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , “ It is only by Beelzebul , the prince of demons , that this man casts out demons . ”
40012025	Knowing their thoughts , he said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and no city or house divided against itself will stand .
40012026	And if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
40012028	But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
40012029	Or how can someone enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man ? Then indeed he may plunder his house .
40012030	Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
40012031	Therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , either in this age or in the age to come .
40012033	“ Either make the tree good and its fruit good , or make the tree bad and its fruit bad , for the tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	You brood of vipers ! How can you speak good , when you are evil ? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks .
40012035	The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good , and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil .
40012036	I tell you , on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak ,
40012037	for by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . ”
40012038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him , saying , “ Teacher , we wish to see a sign from you . ”
40012039	But he answered them , “ An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , something greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	“ When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person , it passes through waterless places seeking rest , but finds none .
40012044	Then it says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came . ’ And when it comes , it finds the house empty , swept , and put in order .
40012045	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they enter and dwell there , and the last state of that person is worse than the first . So also will it be with this evil generation . ”
40012046	While he was still speaking to the people , behold , his mother and his brothers stood outside , asking to speak to him .
40012048	But he replied to the man who told him , “ Who is my mother , and who are my brothers ? ”
40012049	And stretching out his hand toward his disciples , he said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers !
40012050	For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother . ”
40013001	That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea .
40013002	And great crowds gathered about him , so that he got into a boat and sat down . And the whole crowd stood on the beach .
40013003	And he told them many things in parables , saying : “ A sower went out to sow .
40013004	And as he sowed , some seeds fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured them .
40013005	Other seeds fell on rocky ground , where they did not have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , since they had no depth of soil ,
40013006	but when the sun rose they were scorched . And since they had no root , they withered away .
40013007	Other seeds fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them .
40013008	Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
40013009	He who has ears , let him hear . ”
40013010	Then the disciples came and said to him , “ Why do you speak to them in parables ? ”
40013011	And he answered them , “ To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been given .
40013012	For to the one who has , more will be given , and he will have an abundance , but from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
40013013	This is why I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand .
40013014	Indeed , in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says : “ ‘ You will indeed hear but never understand , and you will indeed see but never perceive .
40013015	For this people’s heart has grown dull , and with their ears they can barely hear , and their eyes they have closed , lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn , and I would heal them . ’
40013016	But blessed are your eyes , for they see , and your ears , for they hear .
40013017	For truly , I say to you , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it .
40013018	“ Hear then the parable of the sower :
40013019	When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it , the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart . This is what was sown along the path .
40013020	As for what was sown on rocky ground , this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ,
40013021	yet he has no root in himself , but endures for a while , and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word , immediately he falls away .
40013022	As for what was sown among thorns , this is the one who hears the word , but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and it proves unfruitful .
40013023	As for what was sown on good soil , this is the one who hears the word and understands it . He indeed bears fruit and yields , in one case a hundredfold , in another sixty , and in another thirty . ”
40013024	He put another parable before them , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field ,
40013025	but while his men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away .
40013026	So when the plants came up and bore grain , then the weeds appeared also .
40013027	And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him , ‘ Master , did you not sow good seed in your field ? How then does it have weeds ? ’
40013028	He said to them , ‘ An enemy has done this . ’ So the servants said to him , ‘ Then do you want us to go and gather them ? ’
40013029	But he said , ‘ No , lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest , and at harvest time I will tell the reapers , Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned , but gather the wheat into my barn . ’ ”
40013031	He put another parable before them , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field .
40013032	It is the smallest of all seeds , but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches . ”
40013033	He told them another parable . “ The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour , till it was all leavened . ”
40013034	All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables ; indeed , he said nothing to them without a parable .
40013035	This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet : “ I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world . ”
40013036	Then he left the crowds and went into the house . And his disciples came to him , saying , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field . ”
40013037	He answered , “ The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man .
40013038	The field is the world , and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom . The weeds are the sons of the evil one ,
40013039	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil . The harvest is the close of the age , and the reapers are angels .
40013040	Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire , so will it be at the close of the age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers ,
40013042	and throw them into the fiery furnace . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears , let him hear .
40013044	“ The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field , which a man found and covered up . Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field .
40013045	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls ,
40013046	who , on finding one pearl of great value , went and sold all that he had and bought it .
40013047	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind .
40013048	When it was full , men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad .
40013049	So it will be at the close of the age . The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous
40013050	and throw them into the fiery furnace . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013051	“ Have you understood all these things ? ” They said to him , “ Yes . ”
40013052	And he said to them , “ Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house , who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old . ”
40013053	And when Jesus had finished these parables , he went away from there ,
40013054	and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , “ Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works ?
40013055	Is not this the carpenter’s son ? Is not his mother called Mary ? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
40013056	And are not all his sisters with us ? Where then did this man get all these things ? ”
40013057	And they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household . ”
40013058	And he did not do many mighty works there , because of their unbelief .
40014001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus ,
40014002	and he said to his servants , “ This is John the Baptist . He has been raised from the dead ; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him . ”
40014003	For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife ,
40014004	because John had been saying to him , “ It is not lawful for you to have her . ”
40014005	And though he wanted to put him to death , he feared the people , because they held him to be a prophet .
40014006	But when Herod’s birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod ,
40014007	so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask .
40014008	Prompted by her mother , she said , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter . ”
40014009	And the king was sorry , but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given .
40014010	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison ,
40014011	and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	And his disciples came and took the body and buried it , and they went and told Jesus .
40014013	Now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself . But when the crowds heard it , they followed him on foot from the towns .
40014014	When he went ashore he saw a great crowd , and he had compassion on them and healed their sick .
40014015	Now when it was evening , the disciples came to him and said , “ This is a desolate place , and the day is now over ; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves . ”
40014016	But Jesus said , “ They need not go away ; you give them something to eat . ”
40014017	They said to him , “ We have only five loaves here and two fish . ”
40014018	And he said , “ Bring them here to me . ”
40014019	Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass , and taking the five loaves and the two fish , he looked up to heaven and said a blessing . Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
40014020	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over .
40014021	And those who ate were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side , while he dismissed the crowds .
40014023	And after he had dismissed the crowds , he went up on the mountain by himself to pray . When evening came , he was there alone ,
40014024	but the boat by this time was a long way from the land , beaten by the waves , for the wind was against them .
40014025	And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea .
40014026	But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were terrified , and said , “ It is a ghost ! ” and they cried out in fear .
40014027	But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying , “ Take heart ; it is I . Do not be afraid . ”
40014028	And Peter answered him , “ Lord , if it is you , command me to come to you on the water . ”
40014029	He said , “ Come . ” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus .
40014030	But when he saw the wind , he was afraid , and beginning to sink he cried out , “ Lord , save me . ”
40014031	Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him , saying to him , “ O you of little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
40014032	And when they got into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	And those in the boat worshiped him , saying , “ Truly you are the Son of God . ”
40014034	And when they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret .
40014035	And when the men of that place recognized him , they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick
40014036	and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment . And as many as touched it were made well .
40015001	Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said ,
40015002	“ Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat . ”
40015003	He answered them , “ And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ?
40015004	For God commanded , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and , ‘ Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die . ’
40015005	But you say , ‘ If anyone tells his father or his mother , “ What you would have gained from me is given to God , ”
40015006	he need not honor his father . ’ So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God .
40015007	You hypocrites ! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you , when he said :
40015008	“ ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me ;
40015009	in vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men . ’ ”
40015010	And he called the people to him and said to them , “ Hear and understand :
40015011	it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person , but what comes out of the mouth ; this defiles a person . ”
40015012	Then the disciples came and said to him , “ Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying ? ”
40015013	He answered , “ Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up .
40015014	Let them alone ; they are blind guides . And if the blind lead the blind , both will fall into a pit . ”
40015015	But Peter said to him , “ Explain the parable to us . ”
40015016	And he said , “ Are you also still without understanding ?
40015017	Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled ?
40015018	But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart , and this defiles a person .
40015019	For out of the heart come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual immorality , theft , false witness , slander .
40015020	These are what defile a person . But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone . ”
40015021	And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	And behold , a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying , “ Have mercy on me , O Lord , Son of David ; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon . ”
40015023	But he did not answer her a word . And his disciples came and begged him , saying , “ Send her away , for she is crying out after us . ”
40015024	He answered , “ I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . ”
40015025	But she came and knelt before him , saying , “ Lord , help me . ”
40015026	And he answered , “ It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . ”
40015027	She said , “ Yes , Lord , yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters ’ table . ”
40015028	Then Jesus answered her , “ O woman , great is your faith ! Be it done for you as you desire . ” And her daughter was healed instantly .
40015029	Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee . And he went up on the mountain and sat down there .
40015030	And great crowds came to him , bringing with them the lame , the blind , the crippled , the mute , and many others , and they put them at his feet , and he healed them ,
40015031	so that the crowd wondered , when they saw the mute speaking , the crippled healthy , the lame walking , and the blind seeing . And they glorified the God of Israel .
40015032	Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said , “ I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat . And I am unwilling to send them away hungry , lest they faint on the way . ”
40015033	And the disciples said to him , “ Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd ? ”
40015034	And Jesus said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” They said , “ Seven , and a few small fish . ”
40015035	And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground ,
40015036	he took the seven loaves and the fish , and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds .
40015037	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over .
40015038	Those who ate were four thousand men , besides women and children .
40015039	And after sending away the crowds , he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan .
40016001	And the Pharisees and Sadducees came , and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	He answered them , “ When it is evening , you say , ‘ It will be fair weather , for the sky is red . ’
40016003	And in the morning , ‘ It will be stormy today , for the sky is red and threatening . ’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky , but you cannot interpret the signs of the times .
40016004	An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah . ” So he left them and departed .
40016005	When the disciples reached the other side , they had forgotten to bring any bread .
40016006	Jesus said to them , “ Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40016007	And they began discussing it among themselves , saying , “ We brought no bread . ”
40016008	But Jesus , aware of this , said , “ O you of little faith , why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread ?
40016009	Do you not yet perceive ? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many baskets you gathered ?
40016010	Or the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many baskets you gathered ?
40016011	How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread ? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40016012	Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
40016014	And they said , “ Some say John the Baptist , others say Elijah , and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets . ”
40016015	He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ”
40016016	Simon Peter replied , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . ”
40016017	And Jesus answered him , “ Blessed are you , Simon Bar-Jonah ! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you , but my Father who is in heaven .
40016018	And I tell you , you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my church , and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven , and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven . ”
40016020	Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and on the third day be raised .
40016022	And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him , saying , “ Far be it from you , Lord ! This shall never happen to you . ”
40016023	But he turned and said to Peter , “ Get behind me , Satan ! You are a hindrance to me . For you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but on the things of man . ”
40016024	Then Jesus told his disciples , “ If anyone would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me .
40016025	For whoever would save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it .
40016026	For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul ? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul ?
40016027	For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father , and then he will repay each person according to what he has done .
40016028	Truly , I say to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . ”
40017001	And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James , and John his brother , and led them up a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	And he was transfigured before them , and his face shone like the sun , and his clothes became white as light .
40017003	And behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , talking with him .
40017004	And Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good that we are here . If you wish , I will make three tents here , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah . ”
40017005	He was still speaking when , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased ; listen to him . ”
40017006	When the disciples heard this , they fell on their faces and were terrified .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them , saying , “ Rise , and have no fear . ”
40017008	And when they lifted up their eyes , they saw no one but Jesus only .
40017009	And as they were coming down the mountain , Jesus commanded them , “ Tell no one the vision , until the Son of Man is raised from the dead . ”
40017010	And the disciples asked him , “ Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come ? ”
40017011	He answered , “ Elijah does come , and he will restore all things .
40017012	But I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him , but did to him whatever they pleased . So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands . ”
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist .
40017014	And when they came to the crowd , a man came up to him and , kneeling before him ,
40017015	said , “ Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly . For often he falls into the fire , and often into the water .
40017016	And I brought him to your disciples , and they could not heal him . ”
40017017	And Jesus answered , “ O faithless and twisted generation , how long am I to be with you ? How long am I to bear with you ? Bring him here to me . ”
40017018	And Jesus rebuked the demon , and it came out of him , and the boy was healed instantly .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said , “ Why could we not cast it out ? ”
40017020	He said to them , “ Because of your little faith . For truly , I say to you , if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move , and nothing will be impossible for you . ”
40017022	As they were gathering in Galilee , Jesus said to them , “ The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men ,
40017023	and they will kill him , and he will be raised on the third day . ” And they were greatly distressed .
40017024	When they came to Capernaum , the collectors of the two-drachma tax went up to Peter and said , “ Does your teacher not pay the tax ? ”
40017025	He said , “ Yes . ” And when he came into the house , Jesus spoke to him first , saying , “ What do you think , Simon ? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax ? From their sons or from others ? ”
40017026	And when he said , “ From others , ” Jesus said to him , “ Then the sons are free .
40017027	However , not to give offense to them , go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up , and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel . Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself . ”
40018001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus , saying , “ Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? ”
40018002	And calling to him a child , he put him in the midst of them
40018003	and said , “ Truly , I say to you , unless you turn and become like children , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	“ Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me ,
40018006	but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea .
40018007	“ Woe to the world for temptations to sin ! For it is necessary that temptations come , but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes !
40018008	And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire .
40018009	And if your eye causes you to sin , tear it out and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire .
40018010	“ See that you do not despise one of these little ones . For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
40018012	What do you think ? If a man has a hundred sheep , and one of them has gone astray , does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray ?
40018013	And if he finds it , truly , I say to you , he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray .
40018014	So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
40018015	“ If your brother sins against you , go and tell him his fault , between you and him alone . If he listens to you , you have gained your brother .
40018016	But if he does not listen , take one or two others along with you , that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses .
40018017	If he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the church . And if he refuses to listen even to the church , let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector .
40018018	Truly , I say to you , whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
40018019	Again I say to you , if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three are gathered in my name , there am I among them . ”
40018021	Then Peter came up and said to him , “ Lord , how often will my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? As many as seven times ? ”
40018022	Jesus said to him , “ I do not say to you seven times , but seventy times seven .
40018023	“ Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants .
40018024	When he began to settle , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents .
40018025	And since he could not pay , his master ordered him to be sold , with his wife and children and all that he had , and payment to be made .
40018026	So the servant fell on his knees , imploring him , ‘ Have patience with me , and I will pay you everything . ’
40018027	And out of pity for him , the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt .
40018028	But when that same servant went out , he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii , and seizing him , he began to choke him , saying , ‘ Pay what you owe . ’
40018029	So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him , ‘ Have patience with me , and I will pay you . ’
40018030	He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt .
40018031	When his fellow servants saw what had taken place , they were greatly distressed , and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place .
40018032	Then his master summoned him and said to him , ‘ You wicked servant ! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me .
40018033	And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant , as I had mercy on you ? ’
40018034	And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers , until he should pay all his debt .
40018035	So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you , if you do not forgive your brother from your heart . ”
40019001	Now when Jesus had finished these sayings , he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan .
40019002	And large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking , “ Is it lawful to divorce one’s wife for any cause ? ”
40019004	He answered , “ Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female ,
40019005	and said , ‘ Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh ’ ?
40019006	So they are no longer two but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , let not man separate . ”
40019007	They said to him , “ Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away ? ”
40019008	He said to them , “ Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives , but from the beginning it was not so .
40019009	And I say to you : whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another , commits adultery . ”
40019010	The disciples said to him , “ If such is the case of a man with his wife , it is better not to marry . ”
40019011	But he said to them , “ Not everyone can receive this saying , but only those to whom it is given .
40019012	For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth , and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men , and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . Let the one who is able to receive this receive it . ”
40019013	Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray . The disciples rebuked the people ,
40019014	but Jesus said , “ Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them , for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven . ”
40019015	And he laid his hands on them and went away .
40019016	And behold , a man came up to him , saying , “ Teacher , what good deed must I do to have eternal life ? ”
40019017	And he said to him , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? There is only one who is good . If you would enter life , keep the commandments . ”
40019018	He said to him , “ Which ones ? ” And Jesus said , “ You shall not murder , You shall not commit adultery , You shall not steal , You shall not bear false witness ,
40019019	Honor your father and mother , and , You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
40019020	The young man said to him , “ All these I have kept . What do I still lack ? ”
40019021	Jesus said to him , “ If you would be perfect , go , sell what you possess and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . ”
40019022	When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions .
40019023	And Jesus said to his disciples , “ Truly , I say to you , only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were greatly astonished , saying , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
40019026	But Jesus looked at them and said , “ With man this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . ”
40019027	Then Peter said in reply , “ See , we have left everything and followed you . What then will we have ? ”
40019028	Jesus said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , in the new world , when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands , for my name’s sake , will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many who are first will be last , and the last first .
40020001	“ For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
40020002	After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
40020004	and to them he said , ‘ You go into the vineyard too , and whatever is right I will give you . ’
40020005	So they went . Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour , he did the same .
40020006	And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing . And he said to them , ‘ Why do you stand here idle all day ? ’
40020007	They said to him , ‘ Because no one has hired us . ’ He said to them , ‘ You go into the vineyard too . ’
40020008	And when evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman , ‘ Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning with the last , up to the first . ’
40020009	And when those hired about the eleventh hour came , each of them received a denarius .
40020010	Now when those hired first came , they thought they would receive more , but each of them also received a denarius .
40020011	And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house ,
40020012	saying , ‘ These last worked only one hour , and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat . ’
40020013	But he replied to one of them , ‘ Friend , I am doing you no wrong . Did you not agree with me for a denarius ?
40020014	Take what belongs to you and go . I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you .
40020015	Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me ? Or do you begrudge my generosity ? ’
40020016	So the last will be first , and the first last . ”
40020017	And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside , and on the way he said to them ,
40020018	“ See , we are going up to Jerusalem . And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn him to death
40020019	and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified , and he will be raised on the third day . ”
40020020	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons , and kneeling before him she asked him for something .
40020021	And he said to her , “ What do you want ? ” She said to him , “ Say that these two sons of mine are to sit , one at your right hand and one at your left , in your kingdom . ”
40020022	Jesus answered , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink ? ” They said to him , “ We are able . ”
40020023	He said to them , “ You will drink my cup , but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father . ”
40020024	And when the ten heard it , they were indignant at the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them to him and said , “ You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
40020026	It shall not be so among you . But whoever would be great among you must be your servant ,
40020027	and whoever would be first among you must be your slave ,
40020028	even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . ”
40020029	And as they went out of Jericho , a great crowd followed him .
40020030	And behold , there were two blind men sitting by the roadside , and when they heard that Jesus was passing by , they cried out , “ Lord , have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
40020031	The crowd rebuked them , telling them to be silent , but they cried out all the more , “ Lord , have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
40020032	And stopping , Jesus called them and said , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
40020033	They said to him , “ Lord , let our eyes be opened . ”
40020034	And Jesus in pity touched their eyes , and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him .
40021001	Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage , to the Mount of Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	saying to them , “ Go into the village in front of you , and immediately you will find a donkey tied , and a colt with her . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , you shall say , ‘ The Lord needs them , ’ and he will send them at once . ”
40021004	This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
40021005	“ Say to the daughter of Zion , ‘ Behold , your king is coming to you , humble , and mounted on a donkey , and on a colt , the foal of a beast of burden . ’ ”
40021006	The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks , and he sat on them .
40021008	Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road , and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
40021010	And when he entered Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred up , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
40021011	And the crowds said , “ This is the prophet Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee . ”
40021012	And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple , and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons .
40021013	He said to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer , ’ but you make it a den of robbers . ”
40021014	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying out in the temple , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! ” they were indignant ,
40021016	and they said to him , “ Do you hear what these are saying ? ” And Jesus said to them , “ Yes ; have you never read , “ ‘ Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise ’ ? ”
40021017	And leaving them , he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there .
40021018	In the morning , as he was returning to the city , he became hungry .
40021019	And seeing a fig tree by the wayside , he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves . And he said to it , “ May no fruit ever come from you again ! ” And the fig tree withered at once .
40021020	When the disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , “ How did the fig tree wither at once ? ”
40021021	And Jesus answered them , “ Truly , I say to you , if you have faith and do not doubt , you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ’ it will happen .
40021022	And whatever you ask in prayer , you will receive , if you have faith . ”
40021023	And when he entered the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching , and said , “ By what authority are you doing these things , and who gave you this authority ? ”
40021024	Jesus answered them , “ I also will ask you one question , and if you tell me the answer , then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021025	The baptism of John , from where did it come ? From heaven or from man ? ” And they discussed it among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
40021026	But if we say , ‘ From man , ’ we are afraid of the crowd , for they all hold that John was a prophet . ”
40021027	So they answered Jesus , “ We do not know . ” And he said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021028	“ What do you think ? A man had two sons . And he went to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work in the vineyard today . ’
40021029	And he answered , ‘ I will not , ’ but afterward he changed his mind and went .
40021030	And he went to the other son and said the same . And he answered , ‘ I go , sir , ’ but did not go .
40021031	Which of the two did the will of his father ? ” They said , “ The first . ” Jesus said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you .
40021032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . And even when you saw it , you did not afterward change your minds and believe him .
40021033	“ Hear another parable . There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants , and went into another country .
40021034	When the season for fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit .
40021035	And the tenants took his servants and beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
40021036	Again he sent other servants , more than the first . And they did the same to them .
40021037	Finally he sent his son to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
40021038	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him and have his inheritance . ’
40021039	And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
40021040	When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? ”
40021041	They said to him , “ He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons . ”
40021042	Jesus said to them , “ Have you never read in the Scriptures : “ ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ; this was the Lord’s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ?
40021043	Therefore I tell you , the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits .
40021044	And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces ; and when it falls on anyone , it will crush him . ”
40021045	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they perceived that he was speaking about them .
40021046	And although they were seeking to arrest him , they feared the crowds , because they held him to be a prophet .
40022001	And again Jesus spoke to them in parables , saying ,
40022002	“ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son ,
40022003	and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast , but they would not come .
40022004	Again he sent other servants , saying , ‘ Tell those who are invited , See , I have prepared my dinner , my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding feast . ’
40022005	But they paid no attention and went off , one to his farm , another to his business ,
40022006	while the rest seized his servants , treated them shamefully , and killed them .
40022007	The king was angry , and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding feast is ready , but those invited were not worthy .
40022009	Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find . ’
40022010	And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found , both bad and good . So the wedding hall was filled with guests .
40022011	“ But when the king came in to look at the guests , he saw there a man who had no wedding garment .
40022012	And he said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you get in here without a wedding garment ? ’ And he was speechless .
40022013	Then the king said to the attendants , ‘ Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40022014	For many are called , but few are chosen . ”
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words .
40022016	And they sent their disciples to him , along with the Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully , and you do not care about anyone’s opinion , for you are not swayed by appearances .
40022017	Tell us , then , what you think . Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? ”
40022018	But Jesus , aware of their malice , said , “ Why put me to the test , you hypocrites ?
40022019	Show me the coin for the tax . ” And they brought him a denarius .
40022020	And Jesus said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ”
40022021	They said , “ Caesar’s . ” Then he said to them , “ Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ”
40022022	When they heard it , they marveled . And they left him and went away .
40022023	The same day Sadducees came to him , who say that there is no resurrection , and they asked him a question ,
40022024	saying , “ Teacher , Moses said , ‘ If a man dies having no children , his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother . ’
40022025	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first married and died , and having no children left his wife to his brother .
40022026	So too the second and third , down to the seventh .
40022027	After them all , the woman died .
40022028	In the resurrection , therefore , of the seven , whose wife will she be ? For they all had her . ”
40022029	But Jesus answered them , “ You are wrong , because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
40022031	And as for the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was said to you by God :
40022032	‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not God of the dead , but of the living . ”
40022033	And when the crowd heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
40022034	But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees , they gathered together .
40022035	And one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question to test him .
40022036	“ Teacher , which is the great commandment in the Law ? ”
40022037	And he said to him , “ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind .
40022038	This is the great and first commandment .
40022039	And a second is like it : You shall love your neighbor as yourself .
40022040	On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets . ”
40022041	Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question ,
40022042	saying , “ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They said to him , “ The son of David . ”
40022043	He said to them , “ How is it then that David , in the Spirit , calls him Lord , saying ,
40022044	“ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies under your feet ’ ?
40022045	If then David calls him Lord , how is he his son ? ”
40022046	And no one was able to answer him a word , nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions .
40023001	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples ,
40023002	“ The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses ’ seat ,
40023003	so practice and observe whatever they tell you — but not what they do . For they preach , but do not practice .
40023004	They tie up heavy burdens , hard to bear , and lay them on people’s shoulders , but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger .
40023005	They do all their deeds to be seen by others . For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long ,
40023006	and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues
40023007	and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others .
40023008	But you are not to be called rabbi , for you have one teacher , and you are all brothers .
40023009	And call no man your father on earth , for you have one Father , who is in heaven .
40023010	Neither be called instructors , for you have one instructor , the Christ .
40023011	The greatest among you shall be your servant .
40023012	Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted .
40023013	“ But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces . For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in .
40023015	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte , and when he becomes a proselyte , you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves .
40023016	“ Woe to you , blind guides , who say , ‘ If anyone swears by the temple , it is nothing , but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple , he is bound by his oath . ’
40023017	You blind fools ! For which is greater , the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred ?
40023018	And you say , ‘ If anyone swears by the altar , it is nothing , but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar , he is bound by his oath . ’
40023019	You blind men ! For which is greater , the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred ?
40023020	So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it .
40023021	And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it .
40023022	And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it .
40023023	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin , and have neglected the weightier matters of the law : justice and mercy and faithfulness . These you ought to have done , without neglecting the others .
40023024	You blind guides , straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel !
40023025	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate , but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence .
40023026	You blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate , that the outside also may be clean .
40023027	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you are like whitewashed tombs , which outwardly appear beautiful , but within are full of dead people’s bones and all uncleanness .
40023028	So you also outwardly appear righteous to others , but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
40023029	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous ,
40023030	saying , ‘ If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets . ’
40023031	Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers .
40023033	You serpents , you brood of vipers , how are you to escape being sentenced to hell ?
40023034	Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes , some of whom you will kill and crucify , and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town ,
40023035	so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth , from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah , whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar .
40023036	Truly , I say to you , all these things will come upon this generation .
40023037	“ O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it ! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings , and you would not !
40023038	See , your house is left to you desolate .
40023039	For I tell you , you will not see me again , until you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . ’ ”
40024001	Jesus left the temple and was going away , when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple .
40024002	But he answered them , “ You see all these , do you not ? Truly , I say to you , there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down . ”
40024003	As he sat on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately , saying , “ Tell us , when will these things be , and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age ? ”
40024004	And Jesus answered them , “ See that no one leads you astray .
40024005	For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Christ , ’ and they will lead many astray .
40024006	And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars . See that you are not alarmed , for this must take place , but the end is not yet .
40024007	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places .
40024008	All these are but the beginning of the birth pains .
40024009	“ Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death , and you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake .
40024010	And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another .
40024011	And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray .
40024012	And because lawlessness will be increased , the love of many will grow cold .
40024013	But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
40024014	And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations , and then the end will come .
40024015	“ So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
40024016	then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
40024017	Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house ,
40024018	and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak .
40024019	And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days !
40024020	Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath .
40024021	For then there will be great tribulation , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , and never will be .
40024022	And if those days had not been cut short , no human being would be saved . But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short .
40024023	Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or ‘ There he is ! ’ do not believe it .
40024024	For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , even the elect .
40024025	See , I have told you beforehand .
40024026	So , if they say to you , ‘ Look , he is in the wilderness , ’ do not go out . If they say , ‘ Look , he is in the inner rooms , ’ do not believe it .
40024027	For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024028	Wherever the corpse is , there the vultures will gather .
40024029	“ Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light , and the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
40024030	Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man , and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40024031	And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call , and they will gather his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
40024032	“ From the fig tree learn its lesson : as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves , you know that summer is near .
40024033	So also , when you see all these things , you know that he is near , at the very gates .
40024034	Truly , I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
40024036	“ But concerning that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the Son , but the Father only .
40024037	For as were the days of Noah , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024038	For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day when Noah entered the ark ,
40024039	and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024040	Then two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and one left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding at the mill ; one will be taken and one left .
40024042	Therefore , stay awake , for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming .
40024043	But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming , he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into .
40024044	Therefore you also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect .
40024045	“ Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his master has set over his household , to give them their food at the proper time ?
40024046	Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes .
40024047	Truly , I say to you , he will set him over all his possessions .
40024048	But if that wicked servant says to himself , ‘ My master is delayed , ’
40024049	and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards ,
40024050	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know
40024051	and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40025001	“ Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
40025003	For when the foolish took their lamps , they took no oil with them ,
40025004	but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps .
40025005	As the bridegroom was delayed , they all became drowsy and slept .
40025006	But at midnight there was a cry , ‘ Here is the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him . ’
40025007	Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	And the foolish said to the wise , ‘ Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . ’
40025009	But the wise answered , saying , ‘ Since there will not be enough for us and for you , go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves . ’
40025010	And while they were going to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast , and the door was shut .
40025011	Afterward the other virgins came also , saying , ‘ Lord , lord , open to us . ’
40025012	But he answered , ‘ Truly , I say to you , I do not know you . ’
40025013	Watch therefore , for you know neither the day nor the hour .
40025014	“ For it will be like a man going on a journey , who called his servants and entrusted to them his property .
40025015	To one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one , to each according to his ability . Then he went away .
40025016	He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them , and he made five talents more .
40025017	So also he who had the two talents made two talents more .
40025018	But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master’s money .
40025019	Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them .
40025020	And he who had received the five talents came forward , bringing five talents more , saying , ‘ Master , you delivered to me five talents ; here I have made five talents more . ’
40025021	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . You have been faithful over a little ; I will set you over much . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025022	And he also who had the two talents came forward , saying , ‘ Master , you delivered to me two talents ; here I have made two talents more . ’
40025023	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . You have been faithful over a little ; I will set you over much . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025024	He also who had received the one talent came forward , saying , ‘ Master , I knew you to be a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you scattered no seed ,
40025025	so I was afraid , and I went and hid your talent in the ground . Here you have what is yours . ’
40025026	But his master answered him , ‘ You wicked and slothful servant ! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed ?
40025027	Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers , and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest .
40025028	So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents .
40025029	For to everyone who has will more be given , and he will have an abundance . But from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
40025030	And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40025031	“ When the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then he will sit on his glorious throne .
40025032	Before him will be gathered all the nations , and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	And he will place the sheep on his right , but the goats on the left .
40025034	Then the King will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed by my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
40025035	For I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me drink , I was a stranger and you welcomed me ,
40025036	I was naked and you clothed me , I was sick and you visited me , I was in prison and you came to me . ’
40025037	Then the righteous will answer him , saying , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you drink ?
40025038	And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you , or naked and clothe you ?
40025039	And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you ? ’
40025040	And the King will answer them , ‘ Truly , I say to you , as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers , you did it to me . ’
40025041	“ Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Depart from me , you cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels .
40025042	For I was hungry and you gave me no food , I was thirsty and you gave me no drink ,
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not welcome me , naked and you did not clothe me , sick and in prison and you did not visit me . ’
40025044	Then they also will answer , saying , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not minister to you ? ’
40025045	Then he will answer them , saying , ‘ Truly , I say to you , as you did not do it to one of the least of these , you did not do it to me . ’
40025046	And these will go away into eternal punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . ”
40026001	When Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	“ You know that after two days the Passover is coming , and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified . ”
40026003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest , whose name was Caiaphas ,
40026004	and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him .
40026005	But they said , “ Not during the feast , lest there be an uproar among the people . ”
40026006	Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment , and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table .
40026008	And when the disciples saw it , they were indignant , saying , “ Why this waste ?
40026009	For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor . ”
40026010	But Jesus , aware of this , said to them , “ Why do you trouble the woman ? For she has done a beautiful thing to me .
40026011	For you always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me .
40026012	In pouring this ointment on my body , she has done it to prepare me for burial .
40026013	Truly , I say to you , wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world , what she has done will also be told in memory of her . ”
40026014	Then one of the twelve , whose name was Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
40026015	and said , “ What will you give me if I deliver him over to you ? ” And they paid him thirty pieces of silver .
40026016	And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him .
40026017	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying , “ Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover ? ”
40026018	He said , “ Go into the city to a certain man and say to him , ‘ The Teacher says , My time is at hand . I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples . ’ ”
40026019	And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them , and they prepared the Passover .
40026020	When it was evening , he reclined at table with the twelve .
40026021	And as they were eating , he said , “ Truly , I say to you , one of you will betray me . ”
40026022	And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another , “ Is it I , Lord ? ”
40026023	He answered , “ He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man goes as it is written of him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born . ”
40026025	Judas , who would betray him , answered , “ Is it I , Rabbi ? ” He said to him , “ You have said so . ”
40026026	Now as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples , and said , “ Take , eat ; this is my body . ”
40026027	And he took a cup , and when he had given thanks he gave it to them , saying , “ Drink of it , all of you ,
40026028	for this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom . ”
40026030	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , “ You will all fall away because of me this night . For it is written , ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ’
40026032	But after I am raised up , I will go before you to Galilee . ”
40026033	Peter answered him , “ Though they all fall away because of you , I will never fall away . ”
40026034	Jesus said to him , “ Truly , I tell you , this very night , before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . ”
40026035	Peter said to him , “ Even if I must die with you , I will not deny you ! ” And all the disciples said the same .
40026036	Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to his disciples , “ Sit here , while I go over there and pray . ”
40026037	And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be sorrowful and troubled .
40026038	Then he said to them , “ My soul is very sorrowful , even to death ; remain here , and watch with me . ”
40026039	And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed , saying , “ My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me ; nevertheless , not as I will , but as you will . ”
40026040	And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping . And he said to Peter , “ So , could you not watch with me one hour ?
40026041	Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
40026042	Again , for the second time , he went away and prayed , “ My Father , if this cannot pass unless I drink it , your will be done . ”
40026043	And again he came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	So , leaving them again , he went away and prayed for the third time , saying the same words again .
40026045	Then he came to the disciples and said to them , “ Sleep and take your rest later on . See , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Rise , let us be going ; see , my betrayer is at hand . ”
40026047	While he was still speaking , Judas came , one of the twelve , and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and the elders of the people .
40026048	Now the betrayer had given them a sign , saying , “ The one I will kiss is the man ; seize him . ”
40026049	And he came up to Jesus at once and said , “ Greetings , Rabbi ! ” And he kissed him .
40026050	Jesus said to him , “ Friend , do what you came to do . ” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him .
40026051	And behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him , “ Put your sword back into its place . For all who take the sword will perish by the sword .
40026053	Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father , and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
40026054	But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must be so ? ”
40026055	At that hour Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs to capture me ? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching , and you did not seize me .
40026056	But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . ” Then all the disciples left him and fled .
40026057	Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had gathered .
40026058	And Peter was following him at a distance , as far as the courtyard of the high priest , and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end .
40026059	Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death ,
40026060	but they found none , though many false witnesses came forward . At last two came forward
40026061	and said , “ This man said , ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to rebuild it in three days . ’ ”
40026062	And the high priest stood up and said , “ Have you no answer to make ? What is it that these men testify against you ? ”
40026063	But Jesus remained silent . And the high priest said to him , “ I adjure you by the living God , tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God . ”
40026064	Jesus said to him , “ You have said so . But I tell you , from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven . ”
40026065	Then the high priest tore his robes and said , “ He has uttered blasphemy . What further witnesses do we need ? You have now heard his blasphemy .
40026066	What is your judgment ? ” They answered , “ He deserves death . ”
40026067	Then they spit in his face and struck him . And some slapped him ,
40026068	saying , “ Prophesy to us , you Christ ! Who is it that struck you ? ”
40026069	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard . And a servant girl came up to him and said , “ You also were with Jesus the Galilean . ”
40026070	But he denied it before them all , saying , “ I do not know what you mean . ”
40026071	And when he went out to the entrance , another servant girl saw him , and she said to the bystanders , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth . ”
40026072	And again he denied it with an oath : “ I do not know the man . ”
40026073	After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter , “ Certainly you too are one of them , for your accent betrays you . ”
40026074	Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear , “ I do not know the man . ” And immediately the rooster crowed .
40026075	And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus , “ Before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . ” And he went out and wept bitterly .
40027001	When morning came , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death .
40027002	And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor .
40027003	Then when Judas , his betrayer , saw that Jesus was condemned , he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders ,
40027004	saying , “ I have sinned by betraying innocent blood . ” They said , “ What is that to us ? See to it yourself . ”
40027005	And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple , he departed , and he went and hanged himself .
40027006	But the chief priests , taking the pieces of silver , said , “ It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , since it is blood money . ”
40027007	So they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers .
40027008	Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
40027009	Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah , saying , “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel ,
40027010	and they gave them for the potter’s field , as the Lord directed me . ”
40027011	Now Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ” Jesus said , “ You have said so . ”
40027012	But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he gave no answer .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , “ Do you not hear how many things they testify against you ? ”
40027014	But he gave him no answer , not even to a single charge , so that the governor was greatly amazed .
40027015	Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted .
40027016	And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas .
40027017	So when they had gathered , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release for you : Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
40027018	For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up .
40027019	Besides , while he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent word to him , “ Have nothing to do with that righteous man , for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream . ”
40027020	Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus .
40027021	The governor again said to them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas . ”
40027022	Pilate said to them , “ Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ” They all said , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
40027023	And he said , “ Why , what evil has he done ? ” But they shouted all the more , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
40027024	So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing , but rather that a riot was beginning , he took water and washed his hands before the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of this man’s blood ; see to it yourselves . ”
40027025	And all the people answered , “ His blood be on us and on our children ! ”
40027026	Then he released for them Barabbas , and having scourged Jesus , delivered him to be crucified .
40027027	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s headquarters , and they gathered the whole battalion before him .
40027028	And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him ,
40027029	and twisting together a crown of thorns , they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand . And kneeling before him , they mocked him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
40027030	And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head .
40027031	And when they had mocked him , they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him .
40027032	As they went out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name . They compelled this man to carry his cross .
40027033	And when they came to a place called Golgotha ( which means Place of a Skull ) ,
40027034	they offered him wine to drink , mixed with gall , but when he tasted it , he would not drink it .
40027035	And when they had crucified him , they divided his garments among them by casting lots .
40027036	Then they sat down and kept watch over him there .
40027037	And over his head they put the charge against him , which read , “ This is Jesus , the King of the Jews . ”
40027038	Then two robbers were crucified with him , one on the right and one on the left .
40027039	And those who passed by derided him , wagging their heads
40027040	and saying , “ You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save yourself ! If you are the Son of God , come down from the cross . ”
40027041	So also the chief priests , with the scribes and elders , mocked him , saying ,
40027042	“ He saved others ; he cannot save himself . He is the King of Israel ; let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusts in God ; let God deliver him now , if he desires him . For he said , ‘ I am the Son of God . ’ ”
40027044	And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way .
40027045	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
40027046	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” that is , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
40027047	And some of the bystanders , hearing it , said , “ This man is calling Elijah . ”
40027048	And one of them at once ran and took a sponge , filled it with sour wine , and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink .
40027049	But the others said , “ Wait , let us see whether Elijah will come to save him . ”
40027050	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit .
40027051	And behold , the curtain of the temple was torn in two , from top to bottom . And the earth shook , and the rocks were split .
40027052	The tombs also were opened . And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised ,
40027053	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many .
40027054	When the centurion and those who were with him , keeping watch over Jesus , saw the earthquake and what took place , they were filled with awe and said , “ Truly this was the Son of God ! ”
40027055	There were also many women there , looking on from a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering to him ,
40027056	among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
40027057	When it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who also was a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
40027059	And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud
40027060	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut in the rock . And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there , sitting opposite the tomb .
40027062	The next day , that is , after the day of Preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
40027063	and said , “ Sir , we remember how that impostor said , while he was still alive , ‘ After three days I will rise . ’
40027064	Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day , lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead , ’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first . ”
40027065	Pilate said to them , “ You have a guard of soldiers . Go , make it as secure as you can . ”
40027066	So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard .
40028001	Now after the Sabbath , toward the dawn of the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb .
40028002	And behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothing white as snow .
40028004	And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men .
40028005	But the angel said to the women , “ Do not be afraid , for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here , for he has risen , as he said . Come , see the place where he lay .
40028007	Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead , and behold , he is going before you to Galilee ; there you will see him . See , I have told you . ”
40028008	So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	And behold , Jesus met them and said , “ Greetings ! ” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do not be afraid ; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee , and there they will see me . ”
40028011	While they were going , behold , some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place .
40028012	And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel , they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
40028013	and said , “ Tell people , ‘ His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep . ’
40028014	And if this comes to the governor’s ears , we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble . ”
40028015	So they took the money and did as they were directed . And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day .
40028016	Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them .
40028017	And when they saw him they worshiped him , but some doubted .
40028018	And Jesus came and said to them , “ All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
40028019	Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you . And behold , I am with you always , to the end of the age . ”
41001001	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	As it is written in Isaiah the prophet , “ Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way ,
41001003	the voice of one crying in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare the way of the Lord , make his paths straight , ’ ”
41001004	John appeared , baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
41001005	And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
41001006	Now John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	And he preached , saying , “ After me comes he who is mightier than I , the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie .
41001008	I have baptized you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . ”
41001009	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	And when he came up out of the water , immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove .
41001011	And a voice came from heaven , “ You are my beloved Son ; with you I am well pleased . ”
41001012	The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness .
41001013	And he was in the wilderness forty days , being tempted by Satan . And he was with the wild animals , and the angels were ministering to him .
41001014	Now after John was arrested , Jesus came into Galilee , proclaiming the gospel of God ,
41001015	and saying , “ The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand ; repent and believe in the gospel . ”
41001016	Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea , for they were fishermen .
41001017	And Jesus said to them , “ Follow me , and I will make you become fishers of men . ”
41001018	And immediately they left their nets and followed him .
41001019	And going on a little farther , he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother , who were in their boat mending the nets .
41001020	And immediately he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him .
41001021	And they went into Capernaum , and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching .
41001022	And they were astonished at his teaching , for he taught them as one who had authority , and not as the scribes .
41001023	And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit . And he cried out ,
41001024	“ What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God . ”
41001025	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent , and come out of him ! ”
41001026	And the unclean spirit , convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice , came out of him .
41001027	And they were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority ! He commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . ”
41001028	And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee .
41001029	And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
41001030	Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever , and immediately they told him about her .
41001031	And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up , and the fever left her , and she began to serve them .
41001032	That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons .
41001033	And the whole city was gathered together at the door .
41001034	And he healed many who were sick with various diseases , and cast out many demons . And he would not permit the demons to speak , because they knew him .
41001035	And rising very early in the morning , while it was still dark , he departed and went out to a desolate place , and there he prayed .
41001036	And Simon and those who were with him searched for him ,
41001037	and they found him and said to him , “ Everyone is looking for you . ”
41001038	And he said to them , “ Let us go on to the next towns , that I may preach there also , for that is why I came out . ”
41001039	And he went throughout all Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons .
41001040	And a leper came to him , imploring him , and kneeling said to him , “ If you will , you can make me clean . ”
41001041	Moved with pity , he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him , “ I will ; be clean . ”
41001042	And immediately the leprosy left him , and he was made clean .
41001043	And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once ,
41001044	and said to him , “ See that you say nothing to anyone , but go , show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded , for a proof to them . ”
41001045	But he went out and began to talk freely about it , and to spread the news , so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town , but was out in desolate places , and people were coming to him from every quarter .
41002001	And when he returned to Capernaum after some days , it was reported that he was at home .
41002002	And many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even at the door . And he was preaching the word to them .
41002003	And they came , bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men .
41002004	And when they could not get near him because of the crowd , they removed the roof above him , and when they had made an opening , they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay .
41002005	And when Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Son , your sins are forgiven . ”
41002006	Now some of the scribes were sitting there , questioning in their hearts ,
41002007	“ Why does this man speak like that ? He is blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
41002008	And immediately Jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves , said to them , “ Why do you question these things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise , take up your bed and walk ’ ?
41002010	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” — he said to the paralytic —
41002011	“ I say to you , rise , pick up your bed , and go home . ”
41002012	And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all , so that they were all amazed and glorified God , saying , “ We never saw anything like this ! ”
41002013	He went out again beside the sea , and all the crowd was coming to him , and he was teaching them .
41002014	And as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth , and he said to him , “ Follow me . ” And he rose and followed him .
41002015	And as he reclined at table in his house , many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many who followed him .
41002016	And the scribes of the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
41002017	And when Jesus heard it , he said to them , “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick . I came not to call the righteous , but sinners . ”
41002018	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . And people came and said to him , “ Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
41002019	And Jesus said to them , “ Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
41002020	The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast in that day .
41002021	No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment . If he does , the patch tears away from it , the new from the old , and a worse tear is made .
41002022	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . If he does , the wine will burst the skins — and the wine is destroyed , and so are the skins . But new wine is for fresh wineskins . ”
41002023	One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields , and as they made their way , his disciples began to pluck heads of grain .
41002024	And the Pharisees were saying to him , “ Look , why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath ? ”
41002025	And he said to them , “ Have you never read what David did , when he was in need and was hungry , he and those who were with him :
41002026	how he entered the house of God , in the time of Abiathar the high priest , and ate the bread of the Presence , which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat , and also gave it to those who were with him ? ”
41002027	And he said to them , “ The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath .
41002028	So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath . ”
41003001	Again he entered the synagogue , and a man was there with a withered hand .
41003002	And they watched Jesus , to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath , so that they might accuse him .
41003003	And he said to the man with the withered hand , “ Come here . ”
41003004	And he said to them , “ Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm , to save life or to kill ? ” But they were silent .
41003005	And he looked around at them with anger , grieved at their hardness of heart , and said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He stretched it out , and his hand was restored .
41003006	The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him , how to destroy him .
41003007	Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea , and a great crowd followed , from Galilee and Judea
41003008	and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon . When the great crowd heard all that he was doing , they came to him .
41003009	And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd , lest they crush him ,
41003010	for he had healed many , so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him .
41003011	And whenever the unclean spirits saw him , they fell down before him and cried out , “ You are the Son of God . ”
41003012	And he strictly ordered them not to make him known .
41003013	And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired , and they came to him .
41003014	And he appointed twelve ( whom he also named apostles
41003015	and have authority to cast out demons .
41003016	He appointed the twelve : Simon ( to whom he gave the name Peter ) ;
41003017	James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James ( to whom he gave the name Boanerges , that is , Sons of Thunder ) ;
41003018	Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Cananaean ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
41003020	Then he went home , and the crowd gathered again , so that they could not even eat .
41003021	And when his family heard it , they went out to seize him , for they were saying , “ He is out of his mind . ”
41003022	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying , “ He is possessed by Beelzebul , ” and “ by the prince of demons he casts out the demons . ”
41003023	And he called them to him and said to them in parables , “ How can Satan cast out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
41003025	And if a house is divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
41003026	And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided , he cannot stand , but is coming to an end .
41003027	But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods , unless he first binds the strong man . Then indeed he may plunder his house .
41003028	“ Truly , I say to you , all sins will be forgiven the children of man , and whatever blasphemies they utter ,
41003029	but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin ” —
41003030	for they were saying , “ He has an unclean spirit . ”
41003031	And his mother and his brothers came , and standing outside they sent to him and called him .
41003032	And a crowd was sitting around him , and they said to him , “ Your mother and your brothers are outside , seeking you . ”
41003033	And he answered them , “ Who are my mother and my brothers ? ”
41003034	And looking about at those who sat around him , he said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers !
41003035	For whoever does the will of God , he is my brother and sister and mother . ”
41004001	Again he began to teach beside the sea . And a very large crowd gathered about him , so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea , and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land .
41004002	And he was teaching them many things in parables , and in his teaching he said to them :
41004003	“ Listen ! A sower went out to sow .
41004004	And as he sowed , some seed fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured it .
41004005	Other seed fell on rocky ground , where it did not have much soil , and immediately it sprang up , since it had no depth of soil .
41004006	And when the sun rose , it was scorched , and since it had no root , it withered away .
41004007	Other seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no grain .
41004008	And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain , growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold . ”
41004009	And he said , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41004010	And when he was alone , those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables .
41004011	And he said to them , “ To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God , but for those outside everything is in parables ,
41004012	so that “ they may indeed see but not perceive , and may indeed hear but not understand , lest they should turn and be forgiven . ”
41004013	And he said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How then will you understand all the parables ?
41004014	The sower sows the word .
41004015	And these are the ones along the path , where the word is sown : when they hear , Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them .
41004016	And these are the ones sown on rocky ground : the ones who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy .
41004017	And they have no root in themselves , but endure for a while ; then , when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word , immediately they fall away .
41004018	And others are the ones sown among thorns . They are those who hear the word ,
41004019	but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word , and it proves unfruitful .
41004020	But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit , thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold . ”
41004021	And he said to them , “ Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket , or under a bed , and not on a stand ?
41004022	For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest ; nor is anything secret except to come to light .
41004023	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
41004024	And he said to them , “ Pay attention to what you hear : with the measure you use , it will be measured to you , and still more will be added to you .
41004025	For to the one who has , more will be given , and from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away . ”
41004026	And he said , “ The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground .
41004027	He sleeps and rises night and day , and the seed sprouts and grows ; he knows not how .
41004028	The earth produces by itself , first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
41004029	But when the grain is ripe , at once he puts in the sickle , because the harvest has come . ”
41004030	And he said , “ With what can we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable shall we use for it ?
41004031	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when sown on the ground , is the smallest of all the seeds on earth ,
41004032	yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches , so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade . ”
41004033	With many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it .
41004034	He did not speak to them without a parable , but privately to his own disciples he explained everything .
41004035	On that day , when evening had come , he said to them , “ Let us go across to the other side . ”
41004036	And leaving the crowd , they took him with them in the boat , just as he was . And other boats were with him .
41004037	And a great windstorm arose , and the waves were breaking into the boat , so that the boat was already filling .
41004038	But he was in the stern , asleep on the cushion . And they woke him and said to him , “ Teacher , do you not care that we are perishing ? ”
41004039	And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea , “ Peace ! Be still ! ” And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
41004040	He said to them , “ Why are you so afraid ? Have you still no faith ? ”
41004041	And they were filled with great fear and said to one another , “ Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? ”
41005001	They came to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gerasenes .
41005002	And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit .
41005003	He lived among the tombs . And no one could bind him anymore , not even with a chain ,
41005004	for he had often been bound with shackles and chains , but he wrenched the chains apart , and he broke the shackles in pieces . No one had the strength to subdue him .
41005005	Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	And when he saw Jesus from afar , he ran and fell down before him .
41005007	And crying out with a loud voice , he said , “ What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I adjure you by God , do not torment me . ”
41005008	For he was saying to him , “ Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! ”
41005009	And Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He replied , “ My name is Legion , for we are many . ”
41005010	And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country .
41005011	Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside ,
41005012	and they begged him , saying , “ Send us to the pigs ; let us enter them . ”
41005013	So he gave them permission . And the unclean spirits came out , and entered the pigs , and the herd , numbering about two thousand , rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea .
41005014	The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country . And people came to see what it was that had happened .
41005015	And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man , the one who had had the legion , sitting there , clothed and in his right mind , and they were afraid .
41005016	And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs .
41005017	And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region .
41005018	As he was getting into the boat , the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him .
41005019	And he did not permit him but said to him , “ Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you , and how he has had mercy on you . ”
41005020	And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him , and everyone marveled .
41005021	And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side , a great crowd gathered about him , and he was beside the sea .
41005022	Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name , and seeing him , he fell at his feet
41005023	and implored him earnestly , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death . Come and lay your hands on her , so that she may be made well and live . ”
41005024	And he went with him . And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him .
41005025	And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years ,
41005026	and who had suffered much under many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was no better but rather grew worse .
41005027	She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment .
41005028	For she said , “ If I touch even his garments , I will be made well . ”
41005029	And immediately the flow of blood dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease .
41005030	And Jesus , perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him , immediately turned about in the crowd and said , “ Who touched my garments ? ”
41005031	And his disciples said to him , “ You see the crowd pressing around you , and yet you say , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
41005032	And he looked around to see who had done it .
41005033	But the woman , knowing what had happened to her , came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth .
41005034	And he said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace , and be healed of your disease . ”
41005035	While he was still speaking , there came from the ruler’s house some who said , “ Your daughter is dead . Why trouble the Teacher any further ? ”
41005036	But overhearing what they said , Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue , “ Do not fear , only believe . ”
41005037	And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James .
41005038	They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and Jesus saw a commotion , people weeping and wailing loudly .
41005039	And when he had entered , he said to them , “ Why are you making a commotion and weeping ? The child is not dead but sleeping . ”
41005040	And they laughed at him . But he put them all outside and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was .
41005041	Taking her by the hand he said to her , “ Talitha cumi , ” which means , “ Little girl , I say to you , arise . ”
41005042	And immediately the girl got up and began walking ( for she was twelve years of age ) , and they were immediately overcome with amazement .
41005043	And he strictly charged them that no one should know this , and told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	He went away from there and came to his hometown , and his disciples followed him .
41006002	And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue , and many who heard him were astonished , saying , “ Where did this man get these things ? What is the wisdom given to him ? How are such mighty works done by his hands ?
41006003	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? And are not his sisters here with us ? ” And they took offense at him .
41006004	And Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor , except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household . ”
41006005	And he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
41006006	And he marveled because of their unbelief . And he went about among the villages teaching .
41006007	And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two , and gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
41006008	He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff — no bread , no bag , no money in their belts —
41006009	but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics .
41006010	And he said to them , “ Whenever you enter a house , stay there until you depart from there .
41006011	And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you , when you leave , shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them . ”
41006012	So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent .
41006013	And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them .
41006014	King Herod heard of it , for Jesus ’ name had become known . Some said , “ John the Baptist has been raised from the dead . That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him . ”
41006015	But others said , “ He is Elijah . ” And others said , “ He is a prophet , like one of the prophets of old . ”
41006016	But when Herod heard of it , he said , “ John , whom I beheaded , has been raised . ”
41006017	For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife , because he had married her .
41006018	For John had been saying to Herod , “ It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife . ”
41006019	And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death . But she could not ,
41006020	for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and he kept him safe . When he heard him , he was greatly perplexed , and yet he heard him gladly .
41006021	But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee .
41006022	For when Herodias’s daughter came in and danced , she pleased Herod and his guests . And the king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you wish , and I will give it to you . ”
41006023	And he vowed to her , “ Whatever you ask me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . ”
41006024	And she went out and said to her mother , “ For what should I ask ? ” And she said , “ The head of John the Baptist . ”
41006025	And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked , saying , “ I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter . ”
41006026	And the king was exceedingly sorry , but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her .
41006027	And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head . He went and beheaded him in the prison
41006028	and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	When his disciples heard of it , they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught .
41006031	And he said to them , “ Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while . ” For many were coming and going , and they had no leisure even to eat .
41006032	And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves .
41006033	Now many saw them going and recognized them , and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them .
41006034	When he went ashore he saw a great crowd , and he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . And he began to teach them many things .
41006035	And when it grew late , his disciples came to him and said , “ This is a desolate place , and the hour is now late .
41006036	Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat . ”
41006037	But he answered them , “ You give them something to eat . ” And they said to him , “ Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat ? ”
41006038	And he said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . ” And when they had found out , they said , “ Five , and two fish . ”
41006039	Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	So they sat down in groups , by hundreds and by fifties .
41006041	And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people . And he divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	And they all ate and were satisfied .
41006043	And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish .
41006044	And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men .
41006045	Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he dismissed the crowd .
41006046	And after he had taken leave of them , he went up on the mountain to pray .
41006047	And when evening came , the boat was out on the sea , and he was alone on the land .
41006048	And he saw that they were making headway painfully , for the wind was against them . And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea . He meant to pass by them ,
41006049	but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost , and cried out ,
41006050	for they all saw him and were terrified . But immediately he spoke to them and said , “ Take heart ; it is I . Do not be afraid . ”
41006051	And he got into the boat with them , and the wind ceased . And they were utterly astounded ,
41006052	for they did not understand about the loaves , but their hearts were hardened .
41006053	When they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore .
41006054	And when they got out of the boat , the people immediately recognized him
41006055	and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was .
41006056	And wherever he came , in villages , cities , or countryside , they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment . And as many as touched it were made well .
41007001	Now when the Pharisees gathered to him , with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem ,
41007002	they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled , that is , unwashed .
41007003	( For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands , holding to the tradition of the elders ,
41007004	and when they come from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they wash . And there are many other traditions that they observe , such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches .
41007005	And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , “ Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat with defiled hands ? ”
41007006	And he said to them , “ Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written , “ ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me ;
41007007	in vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men . ’
41007008	You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men . ”
41007009	And he said to them , “ You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition !
41007010	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother ’ ; and , ‘ Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die . ’
41007011	But you say , ‘ If a man tells his father or his mother , “ Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban ” ’ ( that is , given to God ) —
41007012	then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother ,
41007013	thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down . And many such things you do . ”
41007014	And he called the people to him again and said to them , “ Hear me , all of you , and understand :
41007015	There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him , but the things that come out of a person are what defile him . ”
41007017	And when he had entered the house and left the people , his disciples asked him about the parable .
41007018	And he said to them , “ Then are you also without understanding ? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him ,
41007019	since it enters not his heart but his stomach , and is expelled ? ” ( Thus he declared all foods clean .
41007020	And he said , “ What comes out of a person is what defiles him .
41007021	For from within , out of the heart of man , come evil thoughts , sexual immorality , theft , murder , adultery ,
41007022	coveting , wickedness , deceit , sensuality , envy , slander , pride , foolishness .
41007023	All these evil things come from within , and they defile a person . ”
41007024	And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon . And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know , yet he could not be hidden .
41007025	But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet .
41007026	Now the woman was a Gentile , a Syrophoenician by birth . And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	And he said to her , “ Let the children be fed first , for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs . ”
41007028	But she answered him , “ Yes , Lord ; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs . ”
41007029	And he said to her , “ For this statement you may go your way ; the demon has left your daughter . ”
41007030	And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone .
41007031	Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , in the region of the Decapolis .
41007032	And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment , and they begged him to lay his hand on him .
41007033	And taking him aside from the crowd privately , he put his fingers into his ears , and after spitting touched his tongue .
41007034	And looking up to heaven , he sighed and said to him , “ Ephphatha , ” that is , “ Be opened . ”
41007035	And his ears were opened , his tongue was released , and he spoke plainly .
41007036	And Jesus charged them to tell no one . But the more he charged them , the more zealously they proclaimed it .
41007037	And they were astonished beyond measure , saying , “ He has done all things well . He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak . ”
41008001	In those days , when again a great crowd had gathered , and they had nothing to eat , he called his disciples to him and said to them ,
41008002	“ I have compassion on the crowd , because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat .
41008003	And if I send them away hungry to their homes , they will faint on the way . And some of them have come from far away . ”
41008004	And his disciples answered him , “ How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place ? ”
41008005	And he asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” They said , “ Seven . ”
41008006	And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground . And he took the seven loaves , and having given thanks , he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people ; and they set them before the crowd .
41008007	And they had a few small fish . And having blessed them , he said that these also should be set before them .
41008008	And they ate and were satisfied . And they took up the broken pieces left over , seven baskets full .
41008009	And there were about four thousand people . And he sent them away .
41008010	And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came and began to argue with him , seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him .
41008012	And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said , “ Why does this generation seek a sign ? Truly , I say to you , no sign will be given to this generation . ”
41008013	And he left them , got into the boat again , and went to the other side .
41008014	Now they had forgotten to bring bread , and they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	And he cautioned them , saying , “ Watch out ; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod . ”
41008016	And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread .
41008017	And Jesus , aware of this , said to them , “ Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread ? Do you not yet perceive or understand ? Are your hearts hardened ?
41008018	Having eyes do you not see , and having ears do you not hear ? And do you not remember ?
41008019	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? ” They said to him , “ Twelve . ”
41008020	“ And the seven for the four thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? ” And they said to him , “ Seven . ”
41008021	And he said to them , “ Do you not yet understand ? ”
41008022	And they came to Bethsaida . And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him .
41008023	And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village , and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him , he asked him , “ Do you see anything ? ”
41008024	And he looked up and said , “ I see men , but they look like trees , walking . ”
41008025	Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again ; and he opened his eyes , his sight was restored , and he saw everything clearly .
41008026	And he sent him to his home , saying , “ Do not even enter the village . ”
41008027	And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi . And on the way he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
41008028	And they told him , “ John the Baptist ; and others say , Elijah ; and others , one of the prophets . ”
41008029	And he asked them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered him , “ You are the Christ . ”
41008030	And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him .
41008031	And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41008032	And he said this plainly . And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
41008033	But turning and seeing his disciples , he rebuked Peter and said , “ Get behind me , Satan ! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but on the things of man . ”
41008034	And calling the crowd to him with his disciples , he said to them , “ If anyone would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me .
41008035	For whoever would save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it .
41008036	For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul ?
41008037	For what can a man give in return for his soul ?
41008038	For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . ”
41009001	And he said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power . ”
41009002	And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John , and led them up a high mountain by themselves . And he was transfigured before them ,
41009003	and his clothes became radiant , intensely white , as no one on earth could bleach them .
41009004	And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
41009005	And Peter said to Jesus , “ Rabbi , it is good that we are here . Let us make three tents , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah . ”
41009006	For he did not know what to say , for they were terrified .
41009007	And a cloud overshadowed them , and a voice came out of the cloud , “ This is my beloved Son ; listen to him . ”
41009008	And suddenly , looking around , they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only .
41009009	And as they were coming down the mountain , he charged them to tell no one what they had seen , until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41009010	So they kept the matter to themselves , questioning what this rising from the dead might mean .
41009011	And they asked him , “ Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come ? ”
41009012	And he said to them , “ Elijah does come first to restore all things . And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt ?
41009013	But I tell you that Elijah has come , and they did to him whatever they pleased , as it is written of him . ”
41009014	And when they came to the disciples , they saw a great crowd around them , and scribes arguing with them .
41009015	And immediately all the crowd , when they saw him , were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him .
41009016	And he asked them , “ What are you arguing about with them ? ”
41009017	And someone from the crowd answered him , “ Teacher , I brought my son to you , for he has a spirit that makes him mute .
41009018	And whenever it seizes him , it throws him down , and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid . So I asked your disciples to cast it out , and they were not able . ”
41009019	And he answered them , “ O faithless generation , how long am I to be with you ? How long am I to bear with you ? Bring him to me . ”
41009020	And they brought the boy to him . And when the spirit saw him , immediately it convulsed the boy , and he fell on the ground and rolled about , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	And Jesus asked his father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” And he said , “ From childhood .
41009022	And it has often cast him into fire and into water , to destroy him . But if you can do anything , have compassion on us and help us . ”
41009023	And Jesus said to him , “ ‘ If you can ’ ! All things are possible for one who believes . ”
41009024	Immediately the father of the child cried out and said , “ I believe ; help my unbelief ! ”
41009025	And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , “ You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him and never enter him again . ”
41009026	And after crying out and convulsing him terribly , it came out , and the boy was like a corpse , so that most of them said , “ He is dead . ”
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up , and he arose .
41009028	And when he had entered the house , his disciples asked him privately , “ Why could we not cast it out ? ”
41009029	And he said to them , “ This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer . ”
41009030	They went on from there and passed through Galilee . And he did not want anyone to know ,
41009031	for he was teaching his disciples , saying to them , “ The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men , and they will kill him . And when he is killed , after three days he will rise . ”
41009032	But they did not understand the saying , and were afraid to ask him .
41009033	And they came to Capernaum . And when he was in the house he asked them , “ What were you discussing on the way ? ”
41009034	But they kept silent , for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest .
41009035	And he sat down and called the twelve . And he said to them , “ If anyone would be first , he must be last of all and servant of all . ”
41009036	And he took a child and put him in the midst of them , and taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
41009037	“ Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me , and whoever receives me , receives not me but him who sent me . ”
41009038	John said to him , “ Teacher , we saw someone casting out demons in your name , and we tried to stop him , because he was not following us . ”
41009039	But Jesus said , “ Do not stop him , for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me .
41009040	For the one who is not against us is for us .
41009041	For truly , I say to you , whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward .
41009042	“ Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea .
41009043	And if your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell , to the unquenchable fire .
41009045	And if your foot causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell .
41009047	And if your eye causes you to sin , tear it out . It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell ,
41009048	‘ where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched . ’
41009049	For everyone will be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good , but if the salt has lost its saltiness , how will you make it salty again ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . ”
41010001	And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan , and crowds gathered to him again . And again , as was his custom , he taught them .
41010002	And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked , “ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? ”
41010003	He answered them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
41010004	They said , “ Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away . ”
41010005	And Jesus said to them , “ Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
41010006	But from the beginning of creation , ‘ God made them male and female . ’
41010007	‘ Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife ,
41010008	and the two shall become one flesh . ’ So they are no longer two but one flesh .
41010009	What therefore God has joined together , let not man separate . ”
41010010	And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter .
41010011	And he said to them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her ,
41010012	and if she divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery . ”
41010013	And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them , and the disciples rebuked them .
41010014	But when Jesus saw it , he was indignant and said to them , “ Let the children come to me ; do not hinder them , for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
41010015	Truly , I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it . ”
41010016	And he took them in his arms and blessed them , laying his hands on them .
41010017	And as he was setting out on his journey , a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
41010018	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
41010019	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not murder , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honor your father and mother . ’ ”
41010020	And he said to him , “ Teacher , all these I have kept from my youth . ”
41010021	And Jesus , looking at him , loved him , and said to him , “ You lack one thing : go , sell all that you have and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . ”
41010022	Disheartened by the saying , he went away sorrowful , for he had great possessions .
41010023	And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , “ How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
41010024	And the disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus said to them again , “ Children , how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
41010026	And they were exceedingly astonished , and said to him , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , “ With man it is impossible , but not with God . For all things are possible with God . ”
41010028	Peter began to say to him , “ See , we have left everything and followed you . ”
41010029	Jesus said , “ Truly , I say to you , there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands , for my sake and for the gospel ,
41010030	who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions , and in the age to come eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first will be last , and the last first . ”
41010032	And they were on the road , going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking ahead of them . And they were amazed , and those who followed were afraid . And taking the twelve again , he began to tell them what was to happen to him ,
41010033	saying , “ See , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles .
41010034	And they will mock him and spit on him , and flog him and kill him . And after three days he will rise . ”
41010035	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came up to him and said to him , “ Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you . ”
41010036	And he said to them , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
41010037	And they said to him , “ Grant us to sit , one at your right hand and one at your left , in your glory . ”
41010038	Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I drink , or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? ”
41010039	And they said to him , “ We are able . ” And Jesus said to them , “ The cup that I drink you will drink , and with the baptism with which I am baptized , you will be baptized ,
41010040	but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared . ”
41010041	And when the ten heard it , they began to be indignant at James and John .
41010042	And Jesus called them to him and said to them , “ You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
41010043	But it shall not be so among you . But whoever would be great among you must be your servant ,
41010044	and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . ”
41010046	And they came to Jericho . And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , the son of Timaeus , was sitting by the roadside .
41010047	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010048	And many rebuked him , telling him to be silent . But he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010049	And Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him . ” And they called the blind man , saying to him , “ Take heart . Get up ; he is calling you . ”
41010050	And throwing off his cloak , he sprang up and came to Jesus .
41010051	And Jesus said to him , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” And the blind man said to him , “ Rabbi , let me recover my sight . ”
41010052	And Jesus said to him , “ Go your way ; your faith has made you well . ” And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way .
41011001	Now when they drew near to Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two of his disciples
41011002	and said to them , “ Go into the village in front of you , and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied , on which no one has ever sat . Untie it and bring it .
41011003	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately . ’ ”
41011004	And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street , and they untied it .
41011005	And some of those standing there said to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
41011006	And they told them what Jesus had said , and they let them go .
41011007	And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it , and he sat on it .
41011008	And many spread their cloaks on the road , and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields .
41011009	And those who went before and those who followed were shouting , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
41011011	And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple . And when he had looked around at everything , as it was already late , he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
41011012	On the following day , when they came from Bethany , he was hungry .
41011013	And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf , he went to see if he could find anything on it . When he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
41011014	And he said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again . ” And his disciples heard it .
41011015	And they came to Jerusalem . And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple , and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons .
41011016	And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple .
41011017	And he was teaching them and saying to them , “ Is it not written , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ’ ? But you have made it a den of robbers . ”
41011018	And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him , for they feared him , because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching .
41011019	And when evening came they went out of the city .
41011020	As they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots .
41011021	And Peter remembered and said to him , “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree that you cursed has withered . ”
41011022	And Jesus answered them , “ Have faith in God .
41011023	Truly , I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart , but believes that what he says will come to pass , it will be done for him .
41011024	Therefore I tell you , whatever you ask in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
41011025	And whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone , so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses . ”
41011027	And they came again to Jerusalem . And as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him ,
41011028	and they said to him , “ By what authority are you doing these things , or who gave you this authority to do them ? ”
41011029	Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one question ; answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
41011030	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man ? Answer me . ”
41011031	And they discussed it with one another , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
41011032	But shall we say , ‘ From man ’ ? ” — they were afraid of the people , for they all held that John really was a prophet .
41011033	So they answered Jesus , “ We do not know . ” And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
41012001	And he began to speak to them in parables . “ A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower , and leased it to tenants and went into another country .
41012002	When the season came , he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
41012003	And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	Again he sent to them another servant , and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully .
41012005	And he sent another , and him they killed . And so with many others : some they beat , and some they killed .
41012006	He had still one other , a beloved son . Finally he sent him to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
41012007	But those tenants said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . ’
41012008	And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	What will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Have you not read this Scripture : “ ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ;
41012011	this was the Lord’s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ? ”
41012012	And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people , for they perceived that he had told the parable against them . So they left him and went away .
41012013	And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians , to trap him in his talk .
41012014	And they came and said to him , “ Teacher , we know that you are true and do not care about anyone’s opinion . For you are not swayed by appearances , but truly teach the way of God . Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar , or not ? Should we pay them , or should we not ? ”
41012015	But , knowing their hypocrisy , he said to them , “ Why put me to the test ? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it . ”
41012016	And they brought one . And he said to them , “ Whose likeness and inscription is this ? ” They said to him , “ Caesar’s . ”
41012017	Jesus said to them , “ Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ” And they marveled at him .
41012018	And Sadducees came to him , who say that there is no resurrection . And they asked him a question , saying ,
41012019	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife , but leaves no child , the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
41012020	There were seven brothers ; the first took a wife , and when he died left no offspring .
41012021	And the second took her , and died , leaving no offspring . And the third likewise .
41012022	And the seven left no offspring . Last of all the woman also died .
41012023	In the resurrection , when they rise again , whose wife will she be ? For the seven had her as wife . ”
41012024	Jesus said to them , “ Is this not the reason you are wrong , because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God ?
41012025	For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
41012026	And as for the dead being raised , have you not read in the book of Moses , in the passage about the bush , how God spoke to him , saying , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
41012027	He is not God of the dead , but of the living . You are quite wrong . ”
41012028	And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another , and seeing that he answered them well , asked him , “ Which commandment is the most important of all ? ”
41012029	Jesus answered , “ The most important is , ‘ Hear , O Israel : The Lord our God , the Lord is one .
41012030	And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength . ’
41012031	The second is this : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ’ There is no other commandment greater than these . ”
41012032	And the scribe said to him , “ You are right , Teacher . You have truly said that he is one , and there is no other besides him .
41012033	And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength , and to love one’s neighbor as oneself , is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . ”
41012034	And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God . ” And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions .
41012035	And as Jesus taught in the temple , he said , “ How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
41012036	David himself , in the Holy Spirit , declared , “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies under your feet . ’
41012037	David himself calls him Lord . So how is he his son ? ” And the great throng heard him gladly .
41012038	And in his teaching he said , “ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces
41012039	and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts ,
41012040	who devour widows ’ houses and for a pretense make long prayers . They will receive the greater condemnation . ”
41012041	And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box . Many rich people put in large sums .
41012042	And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins , which make a penny .
41012043	And he called his disciples to him and said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box .
41012044	For they all contributed out of their abundance , but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had , all she had to live on . ”
41013001	And as he came out of the temple , one of his disciples said to him , “ Look , Teacher , what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings ! ”
41013002	And Jesus said to him , “ Do you see these great buildings ? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down . ”
41013003	And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	“ Tell us , when will these things be , and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished ? ”
41013005	And Jesus began to say to them , “ See that no one leads you astray .
41013006	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he ! ’ and they will lead many astray .
41013007	And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed . This must take place , but the end is not yet .
41013008	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places ; there will be famines . These are but the beginning of the birth pains .
41013009	“ But be on your guard . For they will deliver you over to councils , and you will be beaten in synagogues , and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake , to bear witness before them .
41013010	And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations .
41013011	And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over , do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say , but say whatever is given you in that hour , for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	And brother will deliver brother over to death , and the father his child , and children will rise against parents and have them put to death .
41013013	And you will be hated by all for my name’s sake . But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
41013014	“ But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be ( let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
41013015	Let the one who is on the housetop not go down , nor enter his house , to take anything out ,
41013016	and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak .
41013017	And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days !
41013018	Pray that it may not happen in winter .
41013019	For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now , and never will be .
41013020	And if the Lord had not cut short the days , no human being would be saved . But for the sake of the elect , whom he chose , he shortened the days .
41013021	And then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ do not believe it .
41013022	For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders , to lead astray , if possible , the elect .
41013023	But be on guard ; I have told you all things beforehand .
41013024	“ But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ,
41013025	and the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
41013026	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven .
41013028	“ From the fig tree learn its lesson : as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves , you know that summer is near .
41013029	So also , when you see these things taking place , you know that he is near , at the very gates .
41013030	Truly , I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
41013032	“ But concerning that day or that hour , no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
41013033	Be on guard , keep awake . For you do not know when the time will come .
41013034	It is like a man going on a journey , when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge , each with his work , and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake .
41013035	Therefore stay awake — for you do not know when the master of the house will come , in the evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or in the morning —
41013036	lest he come suddenly and find you asleep .
41013037	And what I say to you I say to all : Stay awake . ”
41014001	It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread . And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him ,
41014002	for they said , “ Not during the feast , lest there be an uproar from the people . ”
41014003	And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he was reclining at table , a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard , very costly , and she broke the flask and poured it over his head .
41014004	There were some who said to themselves indignantly , “ Why was the ointment wasted like that ?
41014005	For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor . ” And they scolded her .
41014006	But Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . Why do you trouble her ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
41014007	For you always have the poor with you , and whenever you want , you can do good for them . But you will not always have me .
41014008	She has done what she could ; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial .
41014009	And truly , I say to you , wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world , what she has done will be told in memory of her . ”
41014010	Then Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them .
41014011	And when they heard it , they were glad and promised to give him money . And he sought an opportunity to betray him .
41014012	And on the first day of Unleavened Bread , when they sacrificed the Passover lamb , his disciples said to him , “ Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover ? ”
41014013	And he sent two of his disciples and said to them , “ Go into the city , and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him ,
41014014	and wherever he enters , say to the master of the house , ‘ The Teacher says , Where is my guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’
41014015	And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready ; there prepare for us . ”
41014016	And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
41014017	And when it was evening , he came with the twelve .
41014018	And as they were reclining at table and eating , Jesus said , “ Truly , I say to you , one of you will betray me , one who is eating with me . ”
41014019	They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another , “ Is it I ? ”
41014020	He said to them , “ It is one of the twelve , one who is dipping bread into the dish with me .
41014021	For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born . ”
41014022	And as they were eating , he took bread , and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them , and said , “ Take ; this is my body . ”
41014023	And he took a cup , and when he had given thanks he gave it to them , and they all drank of it .
41014024	And he said to them , “ This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many .
41014025	Truly , I say to you , I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God . ”
41014026	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	And Jesus said to them , “ You will all fall away , for it is written , ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ’
41014028	But after I am raised up , I will go before you to Galilee . ”
41014029	Peter said to him , “ Even though they all fall away , I will not . ”
41014030	And Jesus said to him , “ Truly , I tell you , this very night , before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . ”
41014031	But he said emphatically , “ If I must die with you , I will not deny you . ” And they all said the same .
41014032	And they went to a place called Gethsemane . And he said to his disciples , “ Sit here while I pray . ”
41014033	And he took with him Peter and James and John , and began to be greatly distressed and troubled .
41014034	And he said to them , “ My soul is very sorrowful , even to death . Remain here and watch . ”
41014035	And going a little farther , he fell on the ground and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
41014036	And he said , “ Abba , Father , all things are possible for you . Remove this cup from me . Yet not what I will , but what you will . ”
41014037	And he came and found them sleeping , and he said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Could you not watch one hour ?
41014038	Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
41014039	And again he went away and prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	And again he came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy , and they did not know what to answer him .
41014041	And he came the third time and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? It is enough ; the hour has come . The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Rise , let us be going ; see , my betrayer is at hand . ”
41014043	And immediately , while he was still speaking , Judas came , one of the twelve , and with him a crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
41014044	Now the betrayer had given them a sign , saying , “ The one I will kiss is the man . Seize him and lead him away under guard . ”
41014045	And when he came , he went up to him at once and said , “ Rabbi ! ” And he kissed him .
41014046	And they laid hands on him and seized him .
41014047	But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
41014048	And Jesus said to them , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs to capture me ?
41014049	Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching , and you did not seize me . But let the Scriptures be fulfilled . ”
41014050	And they all left him and fled .
41014051	And a young man followed him , with nothing but a linen cloth about his body . And they seized him ,
41014052	but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked .
41014053	And they led Jesus to the high priest . And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together .
41014054	And Peter had followed him at a distance , right into the courtyard of the high priest . And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire .
41014055	Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death , but they found none .
41014056	For many bore false witness against him , but their testimony did not agree .
41014057	And some stood up and bore false witness against him , saying ,
41014058	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another , not made with hands . ’ ”
41014059	Yet even about this their testimony did not agree .
41014060	And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus , “ Have you no answer to make ? What is it that these men testify against you ? ”
41014061	But he remained silent and made no answer . Again the high priest asked him , “ Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? ”
41014062	And Jesus said , “ I am , and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power , and coming with the clouds of heaven . ”
41014063	And the high priest tore his garments and said , “ What further witnesses do we need ?
41014064	You have heard his blasphemy . What is your decision ? ” And they all condemned him as deserving death .
41014065	And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him , saying to him , “ Prophesy ! ” And the guards received him with blows .
41014066	And as Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the servant girls of the high priest came ,
41014067	and seeing Peter warming himself , she looked at him and said , “ You also were with the Nazarene , Jesus . ”
41014068	But he denied it , saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you mean . ” And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed .
41014069	And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders , “ This man is one of them . ”
41014070	But again he denied it . And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter , “ Certainly you are one of them , for you are a Galilean . ”
41014071	But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear , “ I do not know this man of whom you speak . ”
41014072	And immediately the rooster crowed a second time . And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him , “ Before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . ” And he broke down and wept .
41015001	And as soon as it was morning , the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Council . And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate .
41015002	And Pilate asked him , “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ” And he answered him , “ You have said so . ”
41015003	And the chief priests accused him of many things .
41015004	And Pilate again asked him , “ Have you no answer to make ? See how many charges they bring against you . ”
41015005	But Jesus made no further answer , so that Pilate was amazed .
41015006	Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked .
41015007	And among the rebels in prison , who had committed murder in the insurrection , there was a man called Barabbas .
41015008	And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them .
41015009	And he answered them , saying , “ Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews ? ”
41015010	For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead .
41015012	And Pilate again said to them , “ Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews ? ”
41015013	And they cried out again , “ Crucify him . ”
41015014	And Pilate said to them , “ Why , what evil has he done ? ” But they shouted all the more , “ Crucify him . ”
41015015	So Pilate , wishing to satisfy the crowd , released for them Barabbas , and having scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
41015016	And the soldiers led him away inside the palace ( that is , the governor’s headquarters ) , and they called together the whole battalion .
41015017	And they clothed him in a purple cloak , and twisting together a crown of thorns , they put it on him .
41015018	And they began to salute him , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
41015019	And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him .
41015020	And when they had mocked him , they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him . And they led him out to crucify him .
41015021	And they compelled a passerby , Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to carry his cross .
41015022	And they brought him to the place called Golgotha ( which means Place of a Skull ) .
41015023	And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh , but he did not take it .
41015024	And they crucified him and divided his garments among them , casting lots for them , to decide what each should take .
41015025	And it was the third hour when they crucified him .
41015026	And the inscription of the charge against him read , “ The King of the Jews . ”
41015027	And with him they crucified two robbers , one on his right and one on his left .
41015029	And those who passed by derided him , wagging their heads and saying , “ Aha ! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days ,
41015030	save yourself , and come down from the cross ! ”
41015031	So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another , saying , “ He saved others ; he cannot save himself .
41015032	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , come down now from the cross that we may see and believe . ” Those who were crucified with him also reviled him .
41015033	And when the sixth hour had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
41015034	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , “ Eloi , Eloi , lema sabachthani ? ” which means , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
41015035	And some of the bystanders hearing it said , “ Behold , he is calling Elijah . ”
41015036	And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine , put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink , saying , “ Wait , let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down . ”
41015037	And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last .
41015038	And the curtain of the temple was torn in two , from top to bottom .
41015039	And when the centurion , who stood facing him , saw that in this way he breathed his last , he said , “ Truly this man was the Son of God ! ”
41015040	There were also women looking on from a distance , among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses , and Salome .
41015041	When he was in Galilee , they followed him and ministered to him , and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	And when evening had come , since it was the day of Preparation , that is , the day before the Sabbath ,
41015043	Joseph of Arimathea , a respected member of the Council , who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God , took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
41015044	Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died . And summoning the centurion , he asked him whether he was already dead .
41015045	And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead , he granted the corpse to Joseph .
41015046	And Joseph bought a linen shroud , and taking him down , wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock . And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid .
41016001	When the Sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices , so that they might go and anoint him .
41016002	And very early on the first day of the week , when the sun had risen , they went to the tomb .
41016003	And they were saying to one another , “ Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb ? ”
41016004	And looking up , they saw that the stone had been rolled back — it was very large .
41016005	And entering the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , dressed in a white robe , and they were alarmed .
41016006	And he said to them , “ Do not be alarmed . You seek Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He has risen ; he is not here . See the place where they laid him .
41016007	But go , tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee . There you will see him , just as he told you . ”
41016008	And they went out and fled from the tomb , for trembling and astonishment had seized them , and they said nothing to anyone , for they were afraid .
41016009	[ [ Now when he rose early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
41016010	She went and told those who had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
41016011	But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her , they would not believe it .
41016012	After these things he appeared in another form to two of them , as they were walking into the country .
41016013	And they went back and told the rest , but they did not believe them .
41016014	Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table , and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen .
41016015	And he said to them , “ Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation .
41016016	Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved , but whoever does not believe will be condemned .
41016017	And these signs will accompany those who believe : in my name they will cast out demons ; they will speak in new tongues ;
41016018	they will pick up serpents with their hands ; and if they drink any deadly poison , it will not hurt them ; they will lay their hands on the sick , and they will recover . ”
41016019	So then the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	And they went out and preached everywhere , while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs . ] ]
42001001	Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us ,
42001002	just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us ,
42001003	it seemed good to me also , having followed all things closely for some time past , to write an orderly account for you , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught .
42001005	In the days of Herod , king of Judea , there was a priest named Zechariah , of the division of Abijah . And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
42001006	And they were both righteous before God , walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord .
42001007	But they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and both were advanced in years .
42001008	Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty ,
42001009	according to the custom of the priesthood , he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
42001010	And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense .
42001011	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him , and fear fell upon him .
42001013	But the angel said to him , “ Do not be afraid , Zechariah , for your prayer has been heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
42001014	And you will have joy and gladness , and many will rejoice at his birth ,
42001015	for he will be great before the Lord . And he must not drink wine or strong drink , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother’s womb .
42001016	And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God ,
42001017	and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just , to make ready for the Lord a people prepared . ”
42001018	And Zechariah said to the angel , “ How shall I know this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is advanced in years . ”
42001019	And the angel answered him , “ I am Gabriel . I stand in the presence of God , and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news .
42001020	And behold , you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place , because you did not believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their time . ”
42001021	And the people were waiting for Zechariah , and they were wondering at his delay in the temple .
42001022	And when he came out , he was unable to speak to them , and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple . And he kept making signs to them and remained mute .
42001023	And when his time of service was ended , he went to his home .
42001024	After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived , and for five months she kept herself hidden , saying ,
42001025	“ Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me , to take away my reproach among people . ”
42001026	In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth ,
42001027	to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . And the virgin’s name was Mary .
42001028	And he came to her and said , “ Greetings , O favored one , the Lord is with you ! ”
42001029	But she was greatly troubled at the saying , and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be .
42001030	And the angel said to her , “ Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God .
42001031	And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you shall call his name Jesus .
42001032	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High . And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David ,
42001033	and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever , and of his kingdom there will be no end . ”
42001034	And Mary said to the angel , “ How will this be , since I am a virgin ? ”
42001035	And the angel answered her , “ The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you ; therefore the child to be born will be called holy — the Son of God .
42001036	And behold , your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son , and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
42001037	For nothing will be impossible with God . ”
42001038	And Mary said , “ Behold , I am the servant of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word . ” And the angel departed from her .
42001039	In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country , to a town in Judah ,
42001040	and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary , the baby leaped in her womb . And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit ,
42001042	and she exclaimed with a loud cry , “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
42001043	And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
42001044	For behold , when the sound of your greeting came to my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy .
42001045	And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord . ”
42001046	And Mary said , “ My soul magnifies the Lord ,
42001047	and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior ,
42001048	for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant . For behold , from now on all generations will call me blessed ;
42001049	for he who is mighty has done great things for me , and holy is his name .
42001050	And his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation .
42001051	He has shown strength with his arm ; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts ;
42001052	he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate ;
42001053	he has filled the hungry with good things , and the rich he has sent away empty .
42001054	He has helped his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ,
42001055	as he spoke to our fathers , to Abraham and to his offspring forever . ”
42001056	And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home .
42001057	Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth , and she bore a son .
42001058	And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her , and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child . And they would have called him Zechariah after his father ,
42001060	but his mother answered , “ No ; he shall be called John . ”
42001061	And they said to her , “ None of your relatives is called by this name . ”
42001062	And they made signs to his father , inquiring what he wanted him to be called .
42001063	And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote , “ His name is John . ” And they all wondered .
42001064	And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he spoke , blessing God .
42001065	And fear came on all their neighbors . And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea ,
42001066	and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , “ What then will this child be ? ” For the hand of the Lord was with him .
42001067	And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied , saying ,
42001068	“ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , for he has visited and redeemed his people
42001069	and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ,
42001070	as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old ,
42001071	that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us ;
42001072	to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant ,
42001073	the oath that he swore to our father Abraham , to grant us
42001074	that we , being delivered from the hand of our enemies , might serve him without fear ,
42001075	in holiness and righteousness before him all our days .
42001076	And you , child , will be called the prophet of the Most High ; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways ,
42001077	to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins ,
42001078	because of the tender mercy of our God , whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high
42001079	to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace . ”
42001080	And the child grew and became strong in spirit , and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel .
42002001	In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered .
42002002	This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	And all went to be registered , each to his own town .
42002004	And Joseph also went up from Galilee , from the town of Nazareth , to Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and lineage of David ,
42002005	to be registered with Mary , his betrothed , who was with child .
42002006	And while they were there , the time came for her to give birth .
42002007	And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger , because there was no place for them in the inn .
42002008	And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
42002009	And an angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were filled with fear .
42002010	And the angel said to them , “ Fear not , for behold , I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people .
42002011	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior , who is Christ the Lord .
42002012	And this will be a sign for you : you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger . ”
42002013	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying ,
42002014	“ Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased ! ”
42002015	When the angels went away from them into heaven , the shepherds said to one another , “ Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . ”
42002016	And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph , and the baby lying in a manger .
42002017	And when they saw it , they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child .
42002018	And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them .
42002019	But Mary treasured up all these things , pondering them in her heart .
42002020	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen , as it had been told them .
42002021	And at the end of eight days , when he was circumcised , he was called Jesus , the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
42002022	And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses , they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
42002023	( as it is written in the Law of the Lord , “ Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ”
42002024	and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord , “ a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons . ”
42002025	Now there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon , and this man was righteous and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
42002026	And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ .
42002027	And he came in the Spirit into the temple , and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him according to the custom of the Law ,
42002028	he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said ,
42002029	“ Lord , now you are letting your servant depart in peace , according to your word ;
42002030	for my eyes have seen your salvation
42002031	that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples ,
42002032	a light for revelation to the Gentiles , and for glory to your people Israel . ”
42002033	And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him .
42002034	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother , “ Behold , this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel , and for a sign that is opposed
42002035	( and a sword will pierce through your own soul also ) , so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed . ”
42002036	And there was a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was advanced in years , having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin ,
42002037	and then as a widow until she was eighty-four . She did not depart from the temple , worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day .
42002038	And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem .
42002039	And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own town of Nazareth .
42002040	And the child grew and became strong , filled with wisdom . And the favor of God was upon him .
42002041	Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover .
42002042	And when he was twelve years old , they went up according to custom .
42002043	And when the feast was ended , as they were returning , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents did not know it ,
42002044	but supposing him to be in the group they went a day’s journey , but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances ,
42002045	and when they did not find him , they returned to Jerusalem , searching for him .
42002046	After three days they found him in the temple , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
42002048	And when his parents saw him , they were astonished . And his mother said to him , “ Son , why have you treated us so ? Behold , your father and I have been searching for you in great distress . ”
42002049	And he said to them , “ Why were you looking for me ? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house ? ”
42002050	And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them .
42002051	And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them . And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart .
42002052	And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man .
42003001	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene ,
42003002	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness .
42003003	And he went into all the region around the Jordan , proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
42003004	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , “ The voice of one crying in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
42003005	Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be made low , and the crooked shall become straight , and the rough places shall become level ways ,
42003006	and all flesh shall see the salvation of God . ’ ”
42003007	He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him , “ You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
42003008	Bear fruits in keeping with repentance . And do not begin to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I tell you , God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham .
42003009	Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees . Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . ”
42003010	And the crowds asked him , “ What then shall we do ? ”
42003011	And he answered them , “ Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none , and whoever has food is to do likewise . ”
42003012	Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him , “ Teacher , what shall we do ? ”
42003013	And he said to them , “ Collect no more than you are authorized to do . ”
42003014	Soldiers also asked him , “ And we , what shall we do ? ” And he said to them , “ Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation , and be content with your wages . ”
42003015	As the people were in expectation , and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John , whether he might be the Christ ,
42003016	John answered them all , saying , “ I baptize you with water , but he who is mightier than I is coming , the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
42003017	His winnowing fork is in his hand , to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn , but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire . ”
42003018	So with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people .
42003019	But Herod the tetrarch , who had been reproved by him for Herodias , his brother’s wife , and for all the evil things that Herod had done ,
42003020	added this to them all , that he locked up John in prison .
42003021	Now when all the people were baptized , and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying , the heavens were opened ,
42003022	and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form , like a dove ; and a voice came from heaven , “ You are my beloved Son ; with you I am well pleased . ”
42003023	Jesus , when he began his ministry , was about thirty years of age , being the son ( as was supposed
42003024	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	the son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	the son of Joshua , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	the son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Sala , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	the son of Amminadab , the son of Admin , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	the son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	the son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan ,
42003038	the son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	And Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness
42004002	for forty days , being tempted by the devil . And he ate nothing during those days . And when they were ended , he was hungry .
42004003	The devil said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , command this stone to become bread . ”
42004004	And Jesus answered him , “ It is written , ‘ Man shall not live by bread alone . ’ ”
42004005	And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time ,
42004006	and said to him , “ To you I will give all this authority and their glory , for it has been delivered to me , and I give it to whom I will .
42004007	If you , then , will worship me , it will all be yours . ”
42004008	And Jesus answered him , “ It is written , “ ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God , and him only shall you serve . ’ ”
42004009	And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down from here ,
42004010	for it is written , “ ‘ He will command his angels concerning you , to guard you , ’
42004011	and “ ‘ On their hands they will bear you up , lest you strike your foot against a stone . ’ ”
42004012	And Jesus answered him , “ It is said , ‘ You shall not put the Lord your God to the test . ’ ”
42004013	And when the devil had ended every temptation , he departed from him until an opportune time .
42004014	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country .
42004015	And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified by all .
42004016	And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up . And as was his custom , he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and he stood up to read .
42004017	And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him . He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written ,
42004018	“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty those who are oppressed ,
42004019	to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor . ”
42004020	And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down . And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him .
42004021	And he began to say to them , “ Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing . ”
42004022	And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth . And they said , “ Is not this Joseph’s son ? ”
42004023	And he said to them , “ Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb , ‘ Physician , heal yourself . ’ What we have heard you did at Capernaum , do here in your hometown as well . ”
42004024	And he said , “ Truly , I say to you , no prophet is acceptable in his hometown .
42004025	But in truth , I tell you , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heavens were shut up three years and six months , and a great famine came over all the land ,
42004026	and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
42004027	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha , and none of them was cleansed , but only Naaman the Syrian . ”
42004028	When they heard these things , all in the synagogue were filled with wrath .
42004029	And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built , so that they could throw him down the cliff .
42004030	But passing through their midst , he went away .
42004031	And he went down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . And he was teaching them on the Sabbath ,
42004032	and they were astonished at his teaching , for his word possessed authority .
42004033	And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
42004034	“ Ha ! What have you to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God . ”
42004035	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent and come out of him ! ” And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst , he came out of him , having done him no harm .
42004036	And they were all amazed and said to one another , “ What is this word ? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ! ”
42004037	And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region .
42004038	And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon’s house . Now Simon’s mother-in-law was ill with a high fever , and they appealed to him on her behalf .
42004039	And he stood over her and rebuked the fever , and it left her , and immediately she rose and began to serve them .
42004040	Now when the sun was setting , all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him , and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them .
42004041	And demons also came out of many , crying , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
42004042	And when it was day , he departed and went into a desolate place . And the people sought him and came to him , and would have kept him from leaving them ,
42004043	but he said to them , “ I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well ; for I was sent for this purpose . ”
42004044	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea .
42005001	On one occasion , while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God , he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret ,
42005002	and he saw two boats by the lake , but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets .
42005003	Getting into one of the boats , which was Simon’s , he asked him to put out a little from the land . And he sat down and taught the people from the boat .
42005004	And when he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , “ Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch . ”
42005005	And Simon answered , “ Master , we toiled all night and took nothing ! But at your word I will let down the nets . ”
42005006	And when they had done this , they enclosed a large number of fish , and their nets were breaking .
42005007	They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . And they came and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink .
42005008	But when Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , “ Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord . ”
42005009	For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken ,
42005010	and so also were James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , “ Do not be afraid ; from now on you will be catching men . ”
42005011	And when they had brought their boats to land , they left everything and followed him .
42005012	While he was in one of the cities , there came a man full of leprosy . And when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and begged him , “ Lord , if you will , you can make me clean . ”
42005013	And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I will ; be clean . ” And immediately the leprosy left him .
42005014	And he charged him to tell no one , but “ go and show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your cleansing , as Moses commanded , for a proof to them . ”
42005015	But now even more the report about him went abroad , and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities .
42005016	But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray .
42005017	On one of those days , as he was teaching , Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there , who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem . And the power of the Lord was with him to heal .
42005018	And behold , some men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed , and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus ,
42005019	but finding no way to bring him in , because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus .
42005020	And when he saw their faith , he said , “ Man , your sins are forgiven you . ”
42005021	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question , saying , “ Who is this who speaks blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
42005022	When Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answered them , “ Why do you question in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise and walk ’ ?
42005024	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” — he said to the man who was paralyzed — “ I say to you , rise , pick up your bed and go home . ”
42005025	And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home , glorifying God .
42005026	And amazement seized them all , and they glorified God and were filled with awe , saying , “ We have seen extraordinary things today . ”
42005027	After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi , sitting at the tax booth . And he said to him , “ Follow me . ”
42005028	And leaving everything , he rose and followed him .
42005029	And Levi made him a great feast in his house , and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them .
42005030	And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled at his disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
42005031	And Jesus answered them , “ Those who are well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick .
42005032	I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance . ”
42005033	And they said to him , “ The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers , and so do the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours eat and drink . ”
42005034	And Jesus said to them , “ Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them ?
42005035	The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast in those days . ”
42005036	He also told them a parable : “ No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment . If he does , he will tear the new , and the piece from the new will not match the old .
42005037	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . If he does , the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled , and the skins will be destroyed .
42005038	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .
42005039	And no one after drinking old wine desires new , for he says , ‘ The old is good . ’ ”
42006001	On a Sabbath , while he was going through the grainfields , his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain , rubbing them in their hands .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees said , “ Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath ? ”
42006003	And Jesus answered them , “ Have you not read what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him :
42006004	how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence , which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat , and also gave it to those with him ? ”
42006005	And he said to them , “ The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . ”
42006006	On another Sabbath , he entered the synagogue and was teaching , and a man was there whose right hand was withered .
42006007	And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him , to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath , so that they might find a reason to accuse him .
42006008	But he knew their thoughts , and he said to the man with the withered hand , “ Come and stand here . ” And he rose and stood there .
42006009	And Jesus said to them , “ I ask you , is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm , to save life or to destroy it ? ”
42006010	And after looking around at them all he said to him , “ Stretch out your hand . ” And he did so , and his hand was restored .
42006011	But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus .
42006012	In these days he went out to the mountain to pray , and all night he continued in prayer to God .
42006013	And when day came , he called his disciples and chose from them twelve , whom he named apostles :
42006014	Simon , whom he named Peter , and Andrew his brother , and James and John , and Philip , and Bartholomew ,
42006015	and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealot ,
42006016	and Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
42006017	And he came down with them and stood on a level place , with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon ,
42006018	who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases . And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured .
42006019	And all the crowd sought to touch him , for power came out from him and healed them all .
42006020	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said : “ Blessed are you who are poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
42006021	“ Blessed are you who are hungry now , for you shall be satisfied . “ Blessed are you who weep now , for you shall laugh .
42006022	“ Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil , on account of the Son of Man !
42006023	Rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven ; for so their fathers did to the prophets .
42006024	“ But woe to you who are rich , for you have received your consolation .
42006025	“ Woe to you who are full now , for you shall be hungry . “ Woe to you who laugh now , for you shall mourn and weep .
42006026	“ Woe to you , when all people speak well of you , for so their fathers did to the false prophets .
42006027	“ But I say to you who hear , Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	bless those who curse you , pray for those who abuse you .
42006029	To one who strikes you on the cheek , offer the other also , and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either .
42006030	Give to everyone who begs from you , and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back .
42006031	And as you wish that others would do to you , do so to them .
42006032	“ If you love those who love you , what benefit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what benefit is that to you ? For even sinners do the same .
42006034	And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , to get back the same amount .
42006035	But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing in return , and your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High , for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil .
42006036	Be merciful , even as your Father is merciful .
42006037	“ Judge not , and you will not be judged ; condemn not , and you will not be condemned ; forgive , and you will be forgiven ;
42006038	give , and it will be given to you . Good measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over , will be put into your lap . For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you . ”
42006039	He also told them a parable : “ Can a blind man lead a blind man ? Will they not both fall into a pit ?
42006040	A disciple is not above his teacher , but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher .
42006041	Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye , but do not notice the log that is in your own eye ?
42006042	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me take out the speck that is in your eye , ’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite , first take the log out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother’s eye .
42006043	“ For no good tree bears bad fruit , nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit ,
42006044	for each tree is known by its own fruit . For figs are not gathered from thornbushes , nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush .
42006045	The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good , and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil , for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks .
42006046	“ Why do you call me ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and not do what I tell you ?
42006047	Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them , I will show you what he is like :
42006048	he is like a man building a house , who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock . And when a flood arose , the stream broke against that house and could not shake it , because it had been well built .
42006049	But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation . When the stream broke against it , immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house was great . ”
42007001	After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people , he entered Capernaum .
42007002	Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death , who was highly valued by him .
42007003	When the centurion heard about Jesus , he sent to him elders of the Jews , asking him to come and heal his servant .
42007004	And when they came to Jesus , they pleaded with him earnestly , saying , “ He is worthy to have you do this for him ,
42007005	for he loves our nation , and he is the one who built us our synagogue . ”
42007006	And Jesus went with them . When he was not far from the house , the centurion sent friends , saying to him , “ Lord , do not trouble yourself , for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof .
42007007	Therefore I did not presume to come to you . But say the word , and let my servant be healed .
42007008	For I too am a man set under authority , with soldiers under me : and I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes ; and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . ”
42007009	When Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turning to the crowd that followed him , said , “ I tell you , not even in Israel have I found such faith . ”
42007010	And when those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the servant well .
42007011	Soon afterward he went to a town called Nain , and his disciples and a great crowd went with him .
42007012	As he drew near to the gate of the town , behold , a man who had died was being carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow , and a considerable crowd from the town was with her .
42007013	And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her and said to her , “ Do not weep . ”
42007014	Then he came up and touched the bier , and the bearers stood still . And he said , “ Young man , I say to you , arise . ”
42007015	And the dead man sat up and began to speak , and Jesus gave him to his mother .
42007016	Fear seized them all , and they glorified God , saying , “ A great prophet has arisen among us ! ” and “ God has visited his people ! ”
42007017	And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country .
42007018	The disciples of John reported all these things to him . And John ,
42007019	calling two of his disciples to him , sent them to the Lord , saying , “ Are you the one who is to come , or shall we look for another ? ”
42007020	And when the men had come to him , they said , “ John the Baptist has sent us to you , saying , ‘ Are you the one who is to come , or shall we look for another ? ’ ”
42007021	In that hour he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits , and on many who were blind he bestowed sight .
42007022	And he answered them , “ Go and tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the poor have good news preached to them .
42007023	And blessed is the one who is not offended by me . ”
42007024	When John’s messengers had gone , Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	What then did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Behold , those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings ’ courts .
42007026	What then did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	This is he of whom it is written , “ ‘ Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . ’
42007028	I tell you , among those born of women none is greater than John . Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . ”
42007029	( When all the people heard this , and the tax collectors too , they declared God just , having been baptized with the baptism of John ,
42007030	but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves , not having been baptized by him .
42007031	“ To what then shall I compare the people of this generation , and what are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another , “ ‘ We played the flute for you , and you did not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you did not weep . ’
42007033	For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon . ’
42007034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look at him ! A glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
42007035	Yet wisdom is justified by all her children . ”
42007036	One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him , and he went into the Pharisee’s house and took his place at the table .
42007037	And behold , a woman of the city , who was a sinner , when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house , brought an alabaster flask of ointment ,
42007038	and standing behind him at his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment .
42007039	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this , he said to himself , “ If this man were a prophet , he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him , for she is a sinner . ”
42007040	And Jesus answering said to him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you . ” And he answered , “ Say it , Teacher . ”
42007041	“ A certain moneylender had two debtors . One owed five hundred denarii , and the other fifty .
42007042	When they could not pay , he cancelled the debt of both . Now which of them will love him more ? ”
42007043	Simon answered , “ The one , I suppose , for whom he cancelled the larger debt . ” And he said to him , “ You have judged rightly . ”
42007044	Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered your house ; you gave me no water for my feet , but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You gave me no kiss , but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet .
42007046	You did not anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with ointment .
42007047	Therefore I tell you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven — for she loved much . But he who is forgiven little , loves little . ”
42007048	And he said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven . ”
42007049	Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves , “ Who is this , who even forgives sins ? ”
42007050	And he said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you ; go in peace . ”
42008001	Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God . And the twelve were with him ,
42008002	and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
42008003	and Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod’s household manager , and Susanna , and many others , who provided for them out of their means .
42008004	And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him , he said in a parable :
42008005	“ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot , and the birds of the air devoured it .
42008006	And some fell on the rock , and as it grew up , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
42008007	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it .
42008008	And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded a hundredfold . ” As he said these things , he called out , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
42008009	And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant ,
42008010	he said , “ To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God , but for others they are in parables , so that ‘ seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . ’
42008011	Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
42008012	The ones along the path are those who have heard ; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts , so that they may not believe and be saved .
42008013	And the ones on the rock are those who , when they hear the word , receive it with joy . But these have no root ; they believe for a while , and in time of testing fall away .
42008014	And as for what fell among the thorns , they are those who hear , but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life , and their fruit does not mature .
42008015	As for that in the good soil , they are those who , hearing the word , hold it fast in an honest and good heart , and bear fruit with patience .
42008016	“ No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed , but puts it on a stand , so that those who enter may see the light .
42008017	For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest , nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light .
42008018	Take care then how you hear , for to the one who has , more will be given , and from the one who has not , even what he thinks that he has will be taken away . ”
42008019	Then his mother and his brothers came to him , but they could not reach him because of the crowd .
42008020	And he was told , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , desiring to see you . ”
42008021	But he answered them , “ My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it . ”
42008022	One day he got into a boat with his disciples , and he said to them , “ Let us go across to the other side of the lake . ” So they set out ,
42008023	and as they sailed he fell asleep . And a windstorm came down on the lake , and they were filling with water and were in danger .
42008024	And they went and woke him , saying , “ Master , Master , we are perishing ! ” And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves , and they ceased , and there was a calm .
42008025	He said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” And they were afraid , and they marveled , saying to one another , “ Who then is this , that he commands even winds and water , and they obey him ? ”
42008026	Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42008027	When Jesus had stepped out on land , there met him a man from the city who had demons . For a long time he had worn no clothes , and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice , “ What have you to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , do not torment me . ”
42008029	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . ( For many a time it had seized him . He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles , but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert .
42008030	Jesus then asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Legion , ” for many demons had entered him .
42008031	And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss .
42008032	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside , and they begged him to let them enter these . So he gave them permission .
42008033	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned .
42008034	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they fled and told it in the city and in the country .
42008035	Then people went out to see what had happened , and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right mind , and they were afraid .
42008036	And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed .
42008037	Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them , for they were seized with great fear . So he got into the boat and returned .
42008038	The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him , but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	“ Return to your home , and declare how much God has done for you . ” And he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him .
42008040	Now when Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
42008041	And there came a man named Jairus , who was a ruler of the synagogue . And falling at Jesus ’ feet , he implored him to come to his house ,
42008042	for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . As Jesus went , the people pressed around him .
42008043	And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years , and though she had spent all her living on physicians , she could not be healed by anyone .
42008044	She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment , and immediately her discharge of blood ceased .
42008045	And Jesus said , “ Who was it that touched me ? ” When all denied it , Peter said , “ Master , the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you ! ”
42008046	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me , for I perceive that power has gone out from me . ”
42008047	And when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him , and how she had been immediately healed .
42008048	And he said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace . ”
42008049	While he was still speaking , someone from the ruler’s house came and said , “ Your daughter is dead ; do not trouble the Teacher any more . ”
42008050	But Jesus on hearing this answered him , “ Do not fear ; only believe , and she will be well . ”
42008051	And when he came to the house , he allowed no one to enter with him , except Peter and John and James , and the father and mother of the child .
42008052	And all were weeping and mourning for her , but he said , “ Do not weep , for she is not dead but sleeping . ”
42008053	And they laughed at him , knowing that she was dead .
42008054	But taking her by the hand he called , saying , “ Child , arise . ”
42008055	And her spirit returned , and she got up at once . And he directed that something should be given her to eat .
42008056	And her parents were amazed , but he charged them to tell no one what had happened .
42009001	And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases ,
42009002	and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal .
42009003	And he said to them , “ Take nothing for your journey , no staff , nor bag , nor bread , nor money ; and do not have two tunics .
42009004	And whatever house you enter , stay there , and from there depart .
42009005	And wherever they do not receive you , when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them . ”
42009006	And they departed and went through the villages , preaching the gospel and healing everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening , and he was perplexed , because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead ,
42009008	by some that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen .
42009009	Herod said , “ John I beheaded , but who is this about whom I hear such things ? ” And he sought to see him .
42009010	On their return the apostles told him all that they had done . And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida .
42009011	When the crowds learned it , they followed him , and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing .
42009012	Now the day began to wear away , and the twelve came and said to him , “ Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions , for we are here in a desolate place . ”
42009013	But he said to them , “ You give them something to eat . ” They said , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fish — unless we are to go and buy food for all these people . ”
42009014	For there were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , “ Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each . ”
42009015	And they did so , and had them all sit down .
42009016	And taking the five loaves and the two fish , he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them . Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd .
42009017	And they all ate and were satisfied . And what was left over was picked up , twelve baskets of broken pieces .
42009018	Now it happened that as he was praying alone , the disciples were with him . And he asked them , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ”
42009019	And they answered , “ John the Baptist . But others say , Elijah , and others , that one of the prophets of old has risen . ”
42009020	Then he said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” And Peter answered , “ The Christ of God . ”
42009021	And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one ,
42009022	saying , “ The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and on the third day be raised . ”
42009023	And he said to all , “ If anyone would come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me .
42009024	For whoever would save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it .
42009025	For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself ?
42009026	For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	But I tell you truly , there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God . ”
42009028	Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray .
42009029	And as he was praying , the appearance of his face was altered , and his clothing became dazzling white .
42009030	And behold , two men were talking with him , Moses and Elijah ,
42009031	who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure , which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
42009032	Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him .
42009033	And as the men were parting from him , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good that we are here . Let us make three tents , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah ” — not knowing what he said .
42009034	As he was saying these things , a cloud came and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
42009035	And a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , my Chosen One ; listen to him ! ”
42009036	And when the voice had spoken , Jesus was found alone . And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen .
42009037	On the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , a great crowd met him .
42009038	And behold , a man from the crowd cried out , “ Teacher , I beg you to look at my son , for he is my only child .
42009039	And behold , a spirit seizes him , and he suddenly cries out . It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth , and shatters him , and will hardly leave him .
42009040	And I begged your disciples to cast it out , but they could not . ”
42009041	Jesus answered , “ O faithless and twisted generation , how long am I to be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son here . ”
42009042	While he was coming , the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	And all were astonished at the majesty of God . But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing , Jesus said to his disciples ,
42009044	“ Let these words sink into your ears : The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men . ”
42009045	But they did not understand this saying , and it was concealed from them , so that they might not perceive it . And they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
42009046	An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest .
42009047	But Jesus , knowing the reasoning of their hearts , took a child and put him by his side
42009048	and said to them , “ Whoever receives this child in my name receives me , and whoever receives me receives him who sent me . For he who is least among you all is the one who is great . ”
42009049	John answered , “ Master , we saw someone casting out demons in your name , and we tried to stop him , because he does not follow with us . ”
42009050	But Jesus said to him , “ Do not stop him , for the one who is not against you is for you . ”
42009051	When the days drew near for him to be taken up , he set his face to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	And he sent messengers ahead of him , who went and entered a village of the Samaritans , to make preparations for him .
42009053	But the people did not receive him , because his face was set toward Jerusalem .
42009054	And when his disciples James and John saw it , they said , “ Lord , do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? ”
42009055	But he turned and rebuked them .
42009056	And they went on to another village .
42009057	As they were going along the road , someone said to him , “ I will follow you wherever you go . ”
42009058	And Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . ”
42009059	To another he said , “ Follow me . ” But he said , “ Lord , let me first go and bury my father . ”
42009060	And Jesus said to him , “ Leave the dead to bury their own dead . But as for you , go and proclaim the kingdom of God . ”
42009061	Yet another said , “ I will follow you , Lord , but let me first say farewell to those at my home . ”
42009062	Jesus said to him , “ No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God . ”
42010001	After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him , two by two , into every town and place where he himself was about to go .
42010002	And he said to them , “ The harvest is plentiful , but the laborers are few . Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest .
42010003	Go your way ; behold , I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves .
42010004	Carry no moneybag , no knapsack , no sandals , and greet no one on the road .
42010005	Whatever house you enter , first say , ‘ Peace be to this house ! ’
42010006	And if a son of peace is there , your peace will rest upon him . But if not , it will return to you .
42010007	And remain in the same house , eating and drinking what they provide , for the laborer deserves his wages . Do not go from house to house .
42010008	Whenever you enter a town and they receive you , eat what is set before you .
42010009	Heal the sick in it and say to them , ‘ The kingdom of God has come near to you . ’
42010010	But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you , go into its streets and say ,
42010011	‘ Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you . Nevertheless know this , that the kingdom of God has come near . ’
42010012	I tell you , it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town .
42010013	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
42010015	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades .
42010016	“ The one who hears you hears me , and the one who rejects you rejects me , and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me . ”
42010017	The seventy-two returned with joy , saying , “ Lord , even the demons are subject to us in your name ! ”
42010018	And he said to them , “ I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Behold , I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing shall hurt you .
42010020	Nevertheless , do not rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . ”
42010021	In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said , “ I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children ; yes , Father , for such was your gracious will .
42010022	All things have been handed over to me by my Father , and no one knows who the Son is except the Father , or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him . ”
42010023	Then turning to the disciples he said privately , “ Blessed are the eyes that see what you see !
42010024	For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it . ”
42010025	And behold , a lawyer stood up to put him to the test , saying , “ Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
42010026	He said to him , “ What is written in the Law ? How do you read it ? ”
42010027	And he answered , “ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind , and your neighbor as yourself . ”
42010028	And he said to him , “ You have answered correctly ; do this , and you will live . ”
42010029	But he , desiring to justify himself , said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
42010030	Jesus replied , “ A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he fell among robbers , who stripped him and beat him and departed , leaving him half dead .
42010031	Now by chance a priest was going down that road , and when he saw him he passed by on the other side .
42010032	So likewise a Levite , when he came to the place and saw him , passed by on the other side .
42010033	But a Samaritan , as he journeyed , came to where he was , and when he saw him , he had compassion .
42010034	He went to him and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him .
42010035	And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper , saying , ‘ Take care of him , and whatever more you spend , I will repay you when I come back . ’
42010036	Which of these three , do you think , proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers ? ”
42010037	He said , “ The one who showed him mercy . ” And Jesus said to him , “ You go , and do likewise . ”
42010038	Now as they went on their way , Jesus entered a village . And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house .
42010039	And she had a sister called Mary , who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to his teaching .
42010040	But Martha was distracted with much serving . And she went up to him and said , “ Lord , do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Tell her then to help me . ”
42010041	But the Lord answered her , “ Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled about many things ,
42010042	but one thing is necessary . Mary has chosen the good portion , which will not be taken away from her . ”
42011001	Now Jesus was praying in a certain place , and when he finished , one of his disciples said to him , “ Lord , teach us to pray , as John taught his disciples . ”
42011002	And he said to them , “ When you pray , say : “ Father , hallowed be your name . Your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us each day our daily bread ,
42011004	and forgive us our sins , for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation . ”
42011005	And he said to them , “ Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ,
42011006	for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey , and I have nothing to set before him ’ ;
42011007	and he will answer from within , ‘ Do not bother me ; the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed . I cannot get up and give you anything ’ ?
42011008	I tell you , though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend , yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs .
42011009	And I tell you , ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
42011010	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks it will be opened .
42011011	What father among you , if his son asks for a fish , will instead of a fish give him a serpent ;
42011012	or if he asks for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
42011013	If you then , who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ”
42011014	Now he was casting out a demon that was mute . When the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke , and the people marveled .
42011015	But some of them said , “ He casts out demons by Beelzebul , the prince of demons , ”
42011016	while others , to test him , kept seeking from him a sign from heaven .
42011017	But he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and a divided household falls .
42011018	And if Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul .
42011019	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
42011020	But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
42011021	When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his goods are safe ;
42011022	but when one stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him , he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoil .
42011023	Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
42011024	“ When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person , it passes through waterless places seeking rest , and finding none it says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came . ’
42011025	And when it comes , it finds the house swept and put in order .
42011026	Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they enter and dwell there . And the last state of that person is worse than the first . ”
42011027	As he said these things , a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him , “ Blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breasts at which you nursed ! ”
42011028	But he said , “ Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it ! ”
42011029	When the crowds were increasing , he began to say , “ This generation is an evil generation . It seeks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah .
42011030	For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh , so will the Son of Man be to this generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , something greater than Solomon is here .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , something greater than Jonah is here .
42011033	“ No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket , but on a stand , so that those who enter may see the light .
42011034	Your eye is the lamp of your body . When your eye is healthy , your whole body is full of light , but when it is bad , your body is full of darkness .
42011035	Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness .
42011036	If then your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly bright , as when a lamp with its rays gives you light . ”
42011037	While Jesus was speaking , a Pharisee asked him to dine with him , so he went in and reclined at table .
42011038	The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner .
42011039	And the Lord said to him , “ Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish , but inside you are full of greed and wickedness .
42011040	You fools ! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also ?
42011041	But give as alms those things that are within , and behold , everything is clean for you .
42011042	“ But woe to you Pharisees ! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb , and neglect justice and the love of God . These you ought to have done , without neglecting the others .
42011043	Woe to you Pharisees ! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces .
42011044	Woe to you ! For you are like unmarked graves , and people walk over them without knowing it . ”
42011045	One of the lawyers answered him , “ Teacher , in saying these things you insult us also . ”
42011046	And he said , “ Woe to you lawyers also ! For you load people with burdens hard to bear , and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
42011047	Woe to you ! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed .
42011048	So you are witnesses and you consent to the deeds of your fathers , for they killed them , and you build their tombs .
42011049	Therefore also the Wisdom of God said , ‘ I will send them prophets and apostles , some of whom they will kill and persecute , ’
42011050	so that the blood of all the prophets , shed from the foundation of the world , may be charged against this generation ,
42011051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who perished between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , it will be required of this generation .
42011052	Woe to you lawyers ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge . You did not enter yourselves , and you hindered those who were entering . ”
42011053	As he went away from there , the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things ,
42011054	lying in wait for him , to catch him in something he might say .
42012001	In the meantime , when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another , he began to say to his disciples first , “ Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed , or hidden that will not be known .
42012003	Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light , and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops .
42012004	“ I tell you , my friends , do not fear those who kill the body , and after that have nothing more that they can do .
42012005	But I will warn you whom to fear : fear him who , after he has killed , has authority to cast into hell . Yes , I tell you , fear him !
42012006	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? And not one of them is forgotten before God .
42012007	Why , even the hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not ; you are of more value than many sparrows .
42012008	“ And I tell you , everyone who acknowledges me before men , the Son of Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God ,
42012009	but the one who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God .
42012010	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities , do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say ,
42012012	for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say . ”
42012013	Someone in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . ”
42012014	But he said to him , “ Man , who made me a judge or arbitrator over you ? ”
42012015	And he said to them , “ Take care , and be on your guard against all covetousness , for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions . ”
42012016	And he told them a parable , saying , “ The land of a rich man produced plentifully ,
42012017	and he thought to himself , ‘ What shall I do , for I have nowhere to store my crops ? ’
42012018	And he said , ‘ I will do this : I will tear down my barns and build larger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
42012019	And I will say to my soul , Soul , you have ample goods laid up for many years ; relax , eat , drink , be merry . ’
42012020	But God said to him , ‘ Fool ! This night your soul is required of you , and the things you have prepared , whose will they be ? ’
42012021	So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God . ”
42012022	And he said to his disciples , “ Therefore I tell you , do not be anxious about your life , what you will eat , nor about your body , what you will put on .
42012023	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens : they neither sow nor reap , they have neither storehouse nor barn , and yet God feeds them . Of how much more value are you than the birds !
42012025	And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life ?
42012026	If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that , why are you anxious about the rest ?
42012027	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they neither toil nor spin , yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
42012028	But if God so clothes the grass , which is alive in the field today , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith !
42012029	And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink , nor be worried .
42012030	For all the nations of the world seek after these things , and your Father knows that you need them .
42012031	Instead , seek his kingdom , and these things will be added to you .
42012032	“ Fear not , little flock , for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell your possessions , and give to the needy . Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old , with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail , where no thief approaches and no moth destroys .
42012034	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
42012035	“ Stay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning ,
42012036	and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast , so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks .
42012037	Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes . Truly , I say to you , he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table , and he will come and serve them .
42012038	If he comes in the second watch , or in the third , and finds them awake , blessed are those servants !
42012039	But know this , that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have left his house to be broken into .
42012040	You also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect . ”
42012041	Peter said , “ Lord , are you telling this parable for us or for all ? ”
42012042	And the Lord said , “ Who then is the faithful and wise manager , whom his master will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the proper time ?
42012043	Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes .
42012044	Truly , I say to you , he will set him over all his possessions .
42012045	But if that servant says to himself , ‘ My master is delayed in coming , ’ and begins to beat the male and female servants , and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
42012046	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know , and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful .
42012047	And that servant who knew his master’s will but did not get ready or act according to his will , will receive a severe beating .
42012048	But the one who did not know , and did what deserved a beating , will receive a light beating . Everyone to whom much was given , of him much will be required , and from him to whom they entrusted much , they will demand the more .
42012049	“ I came to cast fire on the earth , and would that it were already kindled !
42012050	I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how great is my distress until it is accomplished !
42012051	Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division .
42012052	For from now on in one house there will be five divided , three against two and two against three .
42012053	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . ”
42012054	He also said to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud rising in the west , you say at once , ‘ A shower is coming . ’ And so it happens .
42012055	And when you see the south wind blowing , you say , ‘ There will be scorching heat , ’ and it happens .
42012056	You hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky , but why do you not know how to interpret the present time ?
42012057	“ And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	As you go with your accuser before the magistrate , make an effort to settle with him on the way , lest he drag you to the judge , and the judge hand you over to the officer , and the officer put you in prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny . ”
42013001	There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
42013002	And he answered them , “ Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans , because they suffered in this way ?
42013003	No , I tell you ; but unless you repent , you will all likewise perish .
42013004	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them : do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem ?
42013005	No , I tell you ; but unless you repent , you will all likewise perish . ”
42013006	And he told this parable : “ A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it and found none .
42013007	And he said to the vinedresser , ‘ Look , for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and I find none . Cut it down . Why should it use up the ground ? ’
42013008	And he answered him , ‘ Sir , let it alone this year also , until I dig around it and put on manure .
42013009	Then if it should bear fruit next year , well and good ; but if not , you can cut it down . ’ ”
42013010	Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
42013011	And there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years . She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself .
42013012	When Jesus saw her , he called her over and said to her , “ Woman , you are freed from your disability . ”
42013013	And he laid his hands on her , and immediately she was made straight , and she glorified God .
42013014	But the ruler of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , said to the people , “ There are six days in which work ought to be done . Come on those days and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day . ”
42013015	Then the Lord answered him , “ You hypocrites ! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it ?
42013016	And ought not this woman , a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day ? ”
42013017	As he said these things , all his adversaries were put to shame , and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him .
42013018	He said therefore , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden , and it grew and became a tree , and the birds of the air made nests in its branches . ”
42013020	And again he said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour , until it was all leavened . ”
42013022	He went on his way through towns and villages , teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem .
42013023	And someone said to him , “ Lord , will those who are saved be few ? ” And he said to them ,
42013024	“ Strive to enter through the narrow door . For many , I tell you , will seek to enter and will not be able .
42013025	When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door , and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door , saying , ‘ Lord , open to us , ’ then he will answer you , ‘ I do not know where you come from . ’
42013026	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . ’
42013027	But he will say , ‘ I tell you , I do not know where you come from . Depart from me , all you workers of evil ! ’
42013028	In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out .
42013029	And people will come from east and west , and from north and south , and recline at table in the kingdom of God .
42013030	And behold , some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last . ”
42013031	At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him , “ Get away from here , for Herod wants to kill you . ”
42013032	And he said to them , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I finish my course .
42013033	Nevertheless , I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following , for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem . ’
42013034	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it ! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings , and you would not !
42013035	Behold , your house is forsaken . And I tell you , you will not see me until you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ ”
42014001	One Sabbath , when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees , they were watching him carefully .
42014002	And behold , there was a man before him who had dropsy .
42014003	And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? ”
42014004	But they remained silent . Then he took him and healed him and sent him away .
42014005	And he said to them , “ Which of you , having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day , will not immediately pull him out ? ”
42014006	And they could not reply to these things .
42014007	Now he told a parable to those who were invited , when he noticed how they chose the places of honor , saying to them ,
42014008	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , do not sit down in a place of honor , lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him ,
42014009	and he who invited you both will come and say to you , ‘ Give your place to this person , ’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place .
42014010	But when you are invited , go and sit in the lowest place , so that when your host comes he may say to you , ‘ Friend , move up higher . ’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you .
42014011	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42014012	He said also to the man who had invited him , “ When you give a dinner or a banquet , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors , lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid .
42014013	But when you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ,
42014014	and you will be blessed , because they cannot repay you . For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just . ”
42014015	When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things , he said to him , “ Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ”
42014016	But he said to him , “ A man once gave a great banquet and invited many .
42014017	And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited , ‘ Come , for everything is now ready . ’
42014018	But they all alike began to make excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I have bought a field , and I must go out and see it . Please have me excused . ’
42014019	And another said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to examine them . Please have me excused . ’
42014020	And another said , ‘ I have married a wife , and therefore I cannot come . ’
42014021	So the servant came and reported these things to his master . Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant , ‘ Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame . ’
42014022	And the servant said , ‘ Sir , what you commanded has been done , and still there is room . ’
42014023	And the master said to the servant , ‘ Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in , that my house may be filled .
42014024	For I tell you , none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet . ’ ”
42014025	Now great crowds accompanied him , and he turned and said to them ,
42014026	“ If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , yes , and even his own life , he cannot be my disciple .
42014027	Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple .
42014028	For which of you , desiring to build a tower , does not first sit down and count the cost , whether he has enough to complete it ?
42014029	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish , all who see it begin to mock him ,
42014030	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish . ’
42014031	Or what king , going out to encounter another king in war , will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	And if not , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace .
42014033	So therefore , any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple .
42014034	“ Salt is good , but if salt has lost its taste , how shall its saltiness be restored ?
42014035	It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile . It is thrown away . He who has ears to hear , let him hear . ”
42015001	Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him .
42015002	And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled , saying , “ This man receives sinners and eats with them . ”
42015003	So he told them this parable :
42015004	“ What man of you , having a hundred sheep , if he has lost one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country , and go after the one that is lost , until he finds it ?
42015005	And when he has found it , he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	And when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep that was lost . ’
42015007	Just so , I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance .
42015008	“ Or what woman , having ten silver coins , if she loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it ?
42015009	And when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin that I had lost . ’
42015010	Just so , I tell you , there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents . ”
42015011	And he said , “ There was a man who had two sons .
42015012	And the younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of property that is coming to me . ’ And he divided his property between them .
42015013	Not many days later , the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country , and there he squandered his property in reckless living .
42015014	And when he had spent everything , a severe famine arose in that country , and he began to be in need .
42015015	So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed pigs .
42015016	And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate , and no one gave him anything .
42015017	“ But when he came to himself , he said , ‘ How many of my father’s hired servants have more than enough bread , but I perish here with hunger !
42015018	I will arise and go to my father , and I will say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you .
42015019	I am no longer worthy to be called your son . Treat me as one of your hired servants . ” ’
42015020	And he arose and came to his father . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and felt compassion , and ran and embraced him and kissed him .
42015021	And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you . I am no longer worthy to be called your son . ’
42015022	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Bring quickly the best robe , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet .
42015023	And bring the fattened calf and kill it , and let us eat and celebrate .
42015024	For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . ’ And they began to celebrate .
42015025	“ Now his older son was in the field , and as he came and drew near to the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant .
42015027	And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf , because he has received him back safe and sound . ’
42015028	But he was angry and refused to go in . His father came out and entreated him ,
42015029	but he answered his father , ‘ Look , these many years I have served you , and I never disobeyed your command , yet you never gave me a young goat , that I might celebrate with my friends .
42015030	But when this son of yours came , who has devoured your property with prostitutes , you killed the fattened calf for him ! ’
42015031	And he said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and all that is mine is yours .
42015032	It was fitting to celebrate and be glad , for this your brother was dead , and is alive ; he was lost , and is found . ’ ”
42016001	He also said to the disciples , “ There was a rich man who had a manager , and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions .
42016002	And he called him and said to him , ‘ What is this that I hear about you ? Turn in the account of your management , for you can no longer be manager . ’
42016003	And the manager said to himself , ‘ What shall I do , since my master is taking the management away from me ? I am not strong enough to dig , and I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	I have decided what to do , so that when I am removed from management , people may receive me into their houses . ’
42016005	So , summoning his master’s debtors one by one , he said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
42016006	He said , ‘ A hundred measures of oil . ’ He said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . ’
42016007	Then he said to another , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ He said , ‘ A hundred measures of wheat . ’ He said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and write eighty . ’
42016008	The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness . For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light .
42016009	And I tell you , make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth , so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings .
42016010	“ One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much , and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much .
42016011	If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth , who will entrust to you the true riches ?
42016012	And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s , who will give you that which is your own ?
42016013	No servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and money . ”
42016014	The Pharisees , who were lovers of money , heard all these things , and they ridiculed him .
42016015	And he said to them , “ You are those who justify yourselves before men , but God knows your hearts . For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
42016016	“ The Law and the Prophets were until John ; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached , and everyone forces his way into it .
42016017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void .
42016018	“ Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery .
42016019	“ There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day .
42016020	And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus , covered with sores ,
42016021	who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table . Moreover , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side . The rich man also died and was buried ,
42016023	and in Hades , being in torment , he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side .
42016024	And he called out , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am in anguish in this flame . ’
42016025	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember that you in your lifetime received your good things , and Lazarus in like manner bad things ; but now he is comforted here , and you are in anguish .
42016026	And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been fixed , in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able , and none may cross from there to us . ’
42016027	And he said , ‘ Then I beg you , father , to send him to my father’s house —
42016028	for I have five brothers — so that he may warn them , lest they also come into this place of torment . ’
42016029	But Abraham said , ‘ They have Moses and the Prophets ; let them hear them . ’
42016030	And he said , ‘ No , father Abraham , but if someone goes to them from the dead , they will repent . ’
42016031	He said to him , ‘ If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets , neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead . ’ ”
42017001	And he said to his disciples , “ Temptations to sin are sure to come , but woe to the one through whom they come !
42017002	It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin .
42017003	Pay attention to yourselves ! If your brother sins , rebuke him , and if he repents , forgive him ,
42017004	and if he sins against you seven times in the day , and turns to you seven times , saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you must forgive him . ”
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith ! ”
42017006	And the Lord said , “ If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	“ Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field , ‘ Come at once and recline at table ’ ?
42017008	Will he not rather say to him , ‘ Prepare supper for me , and dress properly , and serve me while I eat and drink , and afterward you will eat and drink ’ ?
42017009	Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded ?
42017010	So you also , when you have done all that you were commanded , say , ‘ We are unworthy servants ; we have only done what was our duty . ’ ”
42017011	On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	And as he entered a village , he was met by ten lepers , who stood at a distance
42017013	and lifted up their voices , saying , “ Jesus , Master , have mercy on us . ”
42017014	When he saw them he said to them , “ Go and show yourselves to the priests . ” And as they went they were cleansed .
42017015	Then one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , praising God with a loud voice ;
42017016	and he fell on his face at Jesus ’ feet , giving him thanks . Now he was a Samaritan .
42017017	Then Jesus answered , “ Were not ten cleansed ? Where are the nine ?
42017018	Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner ? ”
42017019	And he said to him , “ Rise and go your way ; your faith has made you well . ”
42017020	Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , he answered them , “ The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed ,
42017021	nor will they say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or ‘ There ! ’ for behold , the kingdom of God is in the midst of you . ”
42017022	And he said to the disciples , “ The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
42017023	And they will say to you , ‘ Look , there ! ’ or ‘ Look , here ! ’ Do not go out or follow them .
42017024	For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other , so will the Son of Man be in his day .
42017025	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	Just as it was in the days of Noah , so will it be in the days of the Son of Man .
42017027	They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage , until the day when Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	Likewise , just as it was in the days of Lot — they were eating and drinking , buying and selling , planting and building ,
42017029	but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom , fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all —
42017030	so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed .
42017031	On that day , let the one who is on the housetop , with his goods in the house , not come down to take them away , and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife .
42017033	Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life will keep it .
42017034	I tell you , in that night there will be two in one bed . One will be taken and the other left .
42017035	There will be two women grinding together . One will be taken and the other left . ”
42017037	And they said to him , “ Where , Lord ? ” He said to them , “ Where the corpse is , there the vultures will gather . ”
42018001	And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart .
42018002	He said , “ In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man .
42018003	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying , ‘ Give me justice against my adversary . ’
42018004	For a while he refused , but afterward he said to himself , ‘ Though I neither fear God nor respect man ,
42018005	yet because this widow keeps bothering me , I will give her justice , so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming . ’ ”
42018006	And the Lord said , “ Hear what the unrighteous judge says .
42018007	And will not God give justice to his elect , who cry to him day and night ? Will he delay long over them ?
42018008	I tell you , he will give justice to them speedily . Nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on earth ? ”
42018009	He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and treated others with contempt :
42018010	“ Two men went up into the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee , standing by himself , prayed thus : ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other men , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week ; I give tithes of all that I get . ’
42018013	But the tax collector , standing far off , would not even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ‘ God , be merciful to me , a sinner ! ’
42018014	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified , rather than the other . For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42018015	Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them . And when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
42018016	But Jesus called them to him , saying , “ Let the children come to me , and do not hinder them , for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
42018017	Truly , I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it . ”
42018018	And a ruler asked him , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
42018019	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
42018020	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery , Do not murder , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor your father and mother . ’ ”
42018021	And he said , “ All these I have kept from my youth . ”
42018022	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ One thing you still lack . Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . ”
42018023	But when he heard these things , he became very sad , for he was extremely rich .
42018024	Jesus , seeing that he had become sad , said , “ How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God !
42018025	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
42018026	Those who heard it said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
42018027	But he said , “ What is impossible with men is possible with God . ”
42018028	And Peter said , “ See , we have left our homes and followed you . ”
42018029	And he said to them , “ Truly , I say to you , there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children , for the sake of the kingdom of God ,
42018030	who will not receive many times more in this time , and in the age to come eternal life . ”
42018031	And taking the twelve , he said to them , “ See , we are going up to Jerusalem , and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished .
42018032	For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon .
42018033	And after flogging him , they will kill him , and on the third day he will rise . ”
42018034	But they understood none of these things . This saying was hidden from them , and they did not grasp what was said .
42018035	As he drew near to Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
42018036	And hearing a crowd going by , he inquired what this meant .
42018037	They told him , “ Jesus of Nazareth is passing by . ”
42018038	And he cried out , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018039	And those who were in front rebuked him , telling him to be silent . But he cried out all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018040	And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him . And when he came near , he asked him ,
42018041	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He said , “ Lord , let me recover my sight . ”
42018042	And Jesus said to him , “ Recover your sight ; your faith has made you well . ”
42018043	And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him , glorifying God . And all the people , when they saw it , gave praise to God .
42019001	He entered Jericho and was passing through .
42019002	And there was a man named Zacchaeus . He was a chief tax collector and was rich .
42019003	And he was seeking to see who Jesus was , but on account of the crowd he could not , because he was small of stature .
42019004	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him , for he was about to pass that way .
42019005	And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for I must stay at your house today . ”
42019006	So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully .
42019007	And when they saw it , they all grumbled , “ He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner . ”
42019008	And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , “ Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor . And if I have defrauded anyone of anything , I restore it fourfold . ”
42019009	And Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , since he also is a son of Abraham .
42019010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost . ”
42019011	As they heard these things , he proceeded to tell a parable , because he was near to Jerusalem , and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately .
42019012	He said therefore , “ A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return .
42019013	Calling ten of his servants , he gave them ten minas , and said to them , ‘ Engage in business until I come . ’
42019014	But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this man to reign over us . ’
42019015	When he returned , having received the kingdom , he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by doing business .
42019016	The first came before him , saying , ‘ Lord , your mina has made ten minas more . ’
42019017	And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good servant ! Because you have been faithful in a very little , you shall have authority over ten cities . ’
42019018	And the second came , saying , ‘ Lord , your mina has made five minas . ’
42019019	And he said to him , ‘ And you are to be over five cities . ’
42019020	Then another came , saying , ‘ Lord , here is your mina , which I kept laid away in a handkerchief ;
42019021	for I was afraid of you , because you are a severe man . You take what you did not deposit , and reap what you did not sow . ’
42019022	He said to him , ‘ I will condemn you with your own words , you wicked servant ! You knew that I was a severe man , taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow ?
42019023	Why then did you not put my money in the bank , and at my coming I might have collected it with interest ? ’
42019024	And he said to those who stood by , ‘ Take the mina from him , and give it to the one who has the ten minas . ’
42019025	And they said to him , ‘ Lord , he has ten minas ! ’
42019026	‘ I tell you that to everyone who has , more will be given , but from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
42019027	But as for these enemies of mine , who did not want me to reign over them , bring them here and slaughter them before me . ’ ”
42019028	And when he had said these things , he went on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount that is called Olivet , he sent two of the disciples ,
42019030	saying , “ Go into the village in front of you , where on entering you will find a colt tied , on which no one has ever yet sat . Untie it and bring it here .
42019031	If anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ you shall say this : ‘ The Lord has need of it . ’ ”
42019032	So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them .
42019033	And as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
42019034	And they said , “ The Lord has need of it . ”
42019035	And they brought it to Jesus , and throwing their cloaks on the colt , they set Jesus on it .
42019036	And as he rode along , they spread their cloaks on the road .
42019037	As he was drawing near — already on the way down the Mount of Olives — the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ,
42019038	saying , “ Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! ”
42019039	And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , rebuke your disciples . ”
42019040	He answered , “ I tell you , if these were silent , the very stones would cry out . ”
42019041	And when he drew near and saw the city , he wept over it ,
42019042	saying , “ Would that you , even you , had known on this day the things that make for peace ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	For the days will come upon you , when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side
42019044	and tear you down to the ground , you and your children within you . And they will not leave one stone upon another in you , because you did not know the time of your visitation . ”
42019045	And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold ,
42019046	saying to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house shall be a house of prayer , ’ but you have made it a den of robbers . ”
42019047	And he was teaching daily in the temple . The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him ,
42019048	but they did not find anything they could do , for all the people were hanging on his words .
42020001	One day , as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up
42020002	and said to him , “ Tell us by what authority you do these things , or who it is that gave you this authority . ”
42020003	He answered them , “ I also will ask you a question . Now tell me ,
42020004	was the baptism of John from heaven or from man ? ”
42020005	And they discussed it with one another , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ From man , ’ all the people will stone us to death , for they are convinced that John was a prophet . ”
42020007	So they answered that they did not know where it came from .
42020008	And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things . ”
42020009	And he began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while .
42020010	When the time came , he sent a servant to the tenants , so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	And he sent another servant . But they also beat and treated him shamefully , and sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	And he sent yet a third . This one also they wounded and cast out .
42020013	Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; perhaps they will respect him . ’
42020014	But when the tenants saw him , they said to themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Let us kill him , so that the inheritance may be ours . ’
42020015	And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others . ” When they heard this , they said , “ Surely not ! ”
42020017	But he looked directly at them and said , “ What then is this that is written : “ ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ’ ?
42020018	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces , and when it falls on anyone , it will crush him . ”
42020019	The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour , for they perceived that he had told this parable against them , but they feared the people .
42020020	So they watched him and sent spies , who pretended to be sincere , that they might catch him in something he said , so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor .
42020021	So they asked him , “ Teacher , we know that you speak and teach rightly , and show no partiality , but truly teach the way of God .
42020022	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar , or not ? ”
42020023	But he perceived their craftiness , and said to them ,
42020024	“ Show me a denarius . Whose likeness and inscription does it have ? ” They said , “ Caesar’s . ”
42020025	He said to them , “ Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ”
42020026	And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said , but marveling at his answer they became silent .
42020027	There came to him some Sadducees , those who deny that there is a resurrection ,
42020028	and they asked him a question , saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies , having a wife but no children , the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
42020029	Now there were seven brothers . The first took a wife , and died without children .
42020030	And the second
42020031	and the third took her , and likewise all seven left no children and died .
42020032	Afterward the woman also died .
42020033	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife will the woman be ? For the seven had her as wife . ”
42020034	And Jesus said to them , “ The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage ,
42020035	but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage ,
42020036	for they cannot die anymore , because they are equal to angels and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection .
42020037	But that the dead are raised , even Moses showed , in the passage about the bush , where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob .
42020038	Now he is not God of the dead , but of the living , for all live to him . ”
42020039	Then some of the scribes answered , “ Teacher , you have spoken well . ”
42020040	For they no longer dared to ask him any question .
42020041	But he said to them , “ How can they say that the Christ is David’s son ?
42020042	For David himself says in the Book of Psalms , “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand ,
42020043	until I make your enemies your footstool . ’
42020044	David thus calls him Lord , so how is he his son ? ”
42020045	And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples ,
42020046	“ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes , and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts ,
42020047	who devour widows ’ houses and for a pretense make long prayers . They will receive the greater condemnation . ”
42021001	Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box ,
42021002	and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins .
42021003	And he said , “ Truly , I tell you , this poor widow has put in more than all of them .
42021004	For they all contributed out of their abundance , but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on . ”
42021005	And while some were speaking of the temple , how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings , he said ,
42021006	“ As for these things that you see , the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down . ”
42021007	And they asked him , “ Teacher , when will these things be , and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place ? ”
42021008	And he said , “ See that you are not led astray . For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he ! ’ and , ‘ The time is at hand ! ’ Do not go after them .
42021009	And when you hear of wars and tumults , do not be terrified , for these things must first take place , but the end will not be at once . ”
42021010	Then he said to them , “ Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	There will be great earthquakes , and in various places famines and pestilences . And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven .
42021012	But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons , and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake .
42021013	This will be your opportunity to bear witness .
42021014	Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer ,
42021015	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict .
42021016	You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends , and some of you they will put to death .
42021017	You will be hated by all for my name’s sake .
42021018	But not a hair of your head will perish .
42021019	By your endurance you will gain your lives .
42021020	“ But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then know that its desolation has come near .
42021021	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains , and let those who are inside the city depart , and let not those who are out in the country enter it ,
42021022	for these are days of vengeance , to fulfill all that is written .
42021023	Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days ! For there will be great distress upon the earth and wrath against this people .
42021024	They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations , and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
42021025	“ And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars , and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves ,
42021026	people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world . For the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42021027	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
42021028	Now when these things begin to take place , straighten up and raise your heads , because your redemption is drawing near . ”
42021029	And he told them a parable : “ Look at the fig tree , and all the trees .
42021030	As soon as they come out in leaf , you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near .
42021031	So also , when you see these things taking place , you know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	Truly , I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all has taken place .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
42021034	“ But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life , and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap .
42021035	For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth .
42021036	But stay awake at all times , praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place , and to stand before the Son of Man . ”
42021037	And every day he was teaching in the temple , but at night he went out and lodged on the mount called Olivet .
42021038	And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him .
42022001	Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near , which is called the Passover .
42022002	And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death , for they feared the people .
42022003	Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot , who was of the number of the twelve .
42022004	He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them .
42022005	And they were glad , and agreed to give him money .
42022006	So he consented and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of a crowd .
42022007	Then came the day of Unleavened Bread , on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
42022008	So Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover for us , that we may eat it . ”
42022009	They said to him , “ Where will you have us prepare it ? ”
42022010	He said to them , “ Behold , when you have entered the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house that he enters
42022011	and tell the master of the house , ‘ The Teacher says to you , Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ’
42022012	And he will show you a large upper room furnished ; prepare it there . ”
42022013	And they went and found it just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
42022014	And when the hour came , he reclined at table , and the apostles with him .
42022015	And he said to them , “ I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
42022016	For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . ”
42022017	And he took a cup , and when he had given thanks he said , “ Take this , and divide it among yourselves .
42022018	For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes . ”
42022019	And he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is my body , which is given for you . Do this in remembrance of me . ”
42022020	And likewise the cup after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood .
42022021	But behold , the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table .
42022022	For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined , but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed ! ”
42022023	And they began to question one another , which of them it could be who was going to do this .
42022024	A dispute also arose among them , as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest .
42022025	And he said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them , and those in authority over them are called benefactors .
42022026	But not so with you . Rather , let the greatest among you become as the youngest , and the leader as one who serves .
42022027	For who is the greater , one who reclines at table or one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines at table ? But I am among you as the one who serves .
42022028	“ You are those who have stayed with me in my trials ,
42022029	and I assign to you , as my Father assigned to me , a kingdom ,
42022030	that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	“ Simon , Simon , behold , Satan demanded to have you , that he might sift you like wheat ,
42022032	but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail . And when you have turned again , strengthen your brothers . ”
42022033	Peter said to him , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death . ”
42022034	Jesus said , “ I tell you , Peter , the rooster will not crow this day , until you deny three times that you know me . ”
42022035	And he said to them , “ When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals , did you lack anything ? ” They said , “ Nothing . ”
42022036	He said to them , “ But now let the one who has a moneybag take it , and likewise a knapsack . And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one .
42022037	For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me : ‘ And he was numbered with the transgressors . ’ For what is written about me has its fulfillment . ”
42022038	And they said , “ Look , Lord , here are two swords . ” And he said to them , “ It is enough . ”
42022039	And he came out and went , as was his custom , to the Mount of Olives , and the disciples followed him .
42022040	And when he came to the place , he said to them , “ Pray that you may not enter into temptation . ”
42022041	And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw , and knelt down and prayed ,
42022042	saying , “ Father , if you are willing , remove this cup from me . Nevertheless , not my will , but yours , be done . ”
42022043	And there appeared to him an angel from heaven , strengthening him .
42022044	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly ; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
42022045	And when he rose from prayer , he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow ,
42022046	and he said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation . ”
42022047	While he was still speaking , there came a crowd , and the man called Judas , one of the twelve , was leading them . He drew near to Jesus to kiss him ,
42022048	but Jesus said to him , “ Judas , would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
42022049	And when those who were around him saw what would follow , they said , “ Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? ”
42022050	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus said , “ No more of this ! ” And he touched his ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders , who had come out against him , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs ?
42022053	When I was with you day after day in the temple , you did not lay hands on me . But this is your hour , and the power of darkness . ”
42022054	Then they seized him and led him away , bringing him into the high priest’s house , and Peter was following at a distance .
42022055	And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together , Peter sat down among them .
42022056	Then a servant girl , seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him , said , “ This man also was with him . ”
42022057	But he denied it , saying , “ Woman , I do not know him . ”
42022058	And a little later someone else saw him and said , “ You also are one of them . ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not . ”
42022059	And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted , saying , “ Certainly this man also was with him , for he too is a Galilean . ”
42022060	But Peter said , “ Man , I do not know what you are talking about . ” And immediately , while he was still speaking , the rooster crowed .
42022061	And the Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord , how he had said to him , “ Before the rooster crows today , you will deny me three times . ”
42022062	And he went out and wept bitterly .
42022063	Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him .
42022064	They also blindfolded him and kept asking him , “ Prophesy ! Who is it that struck you ? ”
42022065	And they said many other things against him , blaspheming him .
42022066	When day came , the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together , both chief priests and scribes . And they led him away to their council , and they said ,
42022067	“ If you are the Christ , tell us . ” But he said to them , “ If I tell you , you will not believe ,
42022068	and if I ask you , you will not answer .
42022069	But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God . ”
42022070	So they all said , “ Are you the Son of God , then ? ” And he said to them , “ You say that I am . ”
42022071	Then they said , “ What further testimony do we need ? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips . ”
42023001	Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate .
42023002	And they began to accuse him , saying , “ We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar , and saying that he himself is Christ , a king . ”
42023003	And Pilate asked him , “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ” And he answered him , “ You have said so . ”
42023004	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , “ I find no guilt in this man . ”
42023005	But they were urgent , saying , “ He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , from Galilee even to this place . ”
42023006	When Pilate heard this , he asked whether the man was a Galilean .
42023007	And when he learned that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent him over to Herod , who was himself in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	When Herod saw Jesus , he was very glad , for he had long desired to see him , because he had heard about him , and he was hoping to see some sign done by him .
42023009	So he questioned him at some length , but he made no answer .
42023010	The chief priests and the scribes stood by , vehemently accusing him .
42023011	And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him . Then , arraying him in splendid clothing , he sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day , for before this they had been at enmity with each other .
42023013	Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
42023014	and said to them , “ You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people . And after examining him before you , behold , I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him .
42023015	Neither did Herod , for he sent him back to us . Look , nothing deserving death has been done by him .
42023016	I will therefore punish and release him . ”
42023018	But they all cried out together , “ Away with this man , and release to us Barabbas ” —
42023019	a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder .
42023020	Pilate addressed them once more , desiring to release Jesus ,
42023021	but they kept shouting , “ Crucify , crucify him ! ”
42023022	A third time he said to them , “ Why , what evil has he done ? I have found in him no guilt deserving death . I will therefore punish and release him . ”
42023023	But they were urgent , demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified . And their voices prevailed .
42023024	So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted .
42023025	He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , for whom they asked , but he delivered Jesus over to their will .
42023026	And as they led him away , they seized one Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country , and laid on him the cross , to carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him .
42023028	But turning to them Jesus said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	For behold , the days are coming when they will say , ‘ Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed ! ’
42023030	Then they will begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us , ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us . ’
42023031	For if they do these things when the wood is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ”
42023032	Two others , who were criminals , were led away to be put to death with him .
42023033	And when they came to the place that is called The Skull , there they crucified him , and the criminals , one on his right and one on his left .
42023034	And Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . ” And they cast lots to divide his garments .
42023035	And the people stood by , watching , but the rulers scoffed at him , saying , “ He saved others ; let him save himself , if he is the Christ of God , his Chosen One ! ”
42023036	The soldiers also mocked him , coming up and offering him sour wine
42023037	and saying , “ If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
42023038	There was also an inscription over him , “ This is the King of the Jews . ”
42023039	One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him , saying , “ Are you not the Christ ? Save yourself and us ! ”
42023040	But the other rebuked him , saying , “ Do you not fear God , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ?
42023041	And we indeed justly , for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds ; but this man has done nothing wrong . ”
42023042	And he said , “ Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom . ”
42023043	And he said to him , “ Truly , I say to you , today you will be with me in Paradise . ”
42023044	It was now about the sixth hour , and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour ,
42023045	while the sun’s light failed . And the curtain of the temple was torn in two .
42023046	Then Jesus , calling out with a loud voice , said , “ Father , into your hands I commit my spirit ! ” And having said this he breathed his last .
42023047	Now when the centurion saw what had taken place , he praised God , saying , “ Certainly this man was innocent ! ”
42023048	And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle , when they saw what had taken place , returned home beating their breasts .
42023049	And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things .
42023050	Now there was a man named Joseph , from the Jewish town of Arimathea . He was a member of the council , a good and righteous man ,
42023051	who had not consented to their decision and action ; and he was looking for the kingdom of God .
42023052	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42023053	Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone , where no one had ever yet been laid .
42023054	It was the day of Preparation , and the Sabbath was beginning .
42023055	The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid .
42023056	Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments . On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment .
42024001	But on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they went to the tomb , taking the spices they had prepared .
42024002	And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
42024003	but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	While they were perplexed about this , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling apparel .
42024005	And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground , the men said to them , “ Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
42024006	He is not here , but has risen . Remember how he told you , while he was still in Galilee ,
42024007	that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise . ”
42024008	And they remembered his words ,
42024009	and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
42024010	Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles ,
42024011	but these words seemed to them an idle tale , and they did not believe them .
42024012	But Peter rose and ran to the tomb ; stooping and looking in , he saw the linen cloths by themselves ; and he went home marveling at what had happened .
42024013	That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem ,
42024014	and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened .
42024015	While they were talking and discussing together , Jesus himself drew near and went with them .
42024016	But their eyes were kept from recognizing him .
42024017	And he said to them , “ What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk ? ” And they stood still , looking sad .
42024018	Then one of them , named Cleopas , answered him , “ Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days ? ”
42024019	And he said to them , “ What things ? ” And they said to him , “ Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ,
42024020	and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
42024021	But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel . Yes , and besides all this , it is now the third day since these things happened .
42024022	Moreover , some women of our company amazed us . They were at the tomb early in the morning ,
42024023	and when they did not find his body , they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
42024024	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said , but him they did not see . ”
42024025	And he said to them , “ O foolish ones , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
42024026	Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory ? ”
42024027	And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets , he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself .
42024028	So they drew near to the village to which they were going . He acted as if he were going farther ,
42024029	but they urged him strongly , saying , “ Stay with us , for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent . ” So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	When he was at table with them , he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them .
42024031	And their eyes were opened , and they recognized him . And he vanished from their sight .
42024032	They said to each other , “ Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road , while he opened to us the Scriptures ? ”
42024033	And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem . And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together ,
42024034	saying , “ The Lord has risen indeed , and has appeared to Simon ! ”
42024035	Then they told what had happened on the road , and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread .
42024036	As they were talking about these things , Jesus himself stood among them , and said to them , “ Peace to you ! ”
42024037	But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit .
42024038	And he said to them , “ Why are you troubled , and why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
42024039	See my hands and my feet , that it is I myself . Touch me , and see . For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have . ”
42024040	And when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
42024041	And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling , he said to them , “ Have you anything here to eat ? ”
42024042	They gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
42024043	and he took it and ate before them .
42024044	Then he said to them , “ These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you , that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled . ”
42024045	Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42024046	and said to them , “ Thus it is written , that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead ,
42024047	and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And behold , I am sending the promise of my Father upon you . But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high . ”
42024050	Then he led them out as far as Bethany , and lifting up his hands he blessed them .
42024051	While he blessed them , he parted from them and was carried up into heaven .
42024052	And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
42024053	and were continually in the temple blessing God .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was in the beginning with God .
43001003	All things were made through him , and without him was not any thing made that was made .
43001004	In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overcome it .
43001006	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	He came as a witness , to bear witness about the light , that all might believe through him .
43001008	He was not the light , but came to bear witness about the light .
43001009	The true light , which enlightens everyone , was coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world was made through him , yet the world did not know him .
43001011	He came to his own , and his own people did not receive him .
43001012	But to all who did receive him , who believed in his name , he gave the right to become children of God ,
43001013	who were born , not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man , but of God .
43001014	And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us , and we have seen his glory , glory as of the only Son from the Father , full of grace and truth .
43001015	( John bore witness about him , and cried out , “ This was he of whom I said , ‘ He who comes after me ranks before me , because he was before me . ’ ”
43001016	And from his fullness we have all received , grace upon grace .
43001017	For the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God ; the only God , who is at the Father’s side , he has made him known .
43001019	And this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
43001020	He confessed , and did not deny , but confessed , “ I am not the Christ . ”
43001021	And they asked him , “ What then ? Are you Elijah ? ” He said , “ I am not . ” “ Are you the Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No . ”
43001022	So they said to him , “ Who are you ? We need to give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
43001023	He said , “ I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness , ‘ Make straight the way of the Lord , ’ as the prophet Isaiah said . ”
43001024	( Now they had been sent from the Pharisees .
43001025	They asked him , “ Then why are you baptizing , if you are neither the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? ”
43001026	John answered them , “ I baptize with water , but among you stands one you do not know ,
43001027	even he who comes after me , the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie . ”
43001028	These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him , and said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is he of whom I said , ‘ After me comes a man who ranks before me , because he was before me . ’
43001031	I myself did not know him , but for this purpose I came baptizing with water , that he might be revealed to Israel . ”
43001032	And John bore witness : “ I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove , and it remained on him .
43001033	I myself did not know him , but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me , ‘ He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain , this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . ’
43001034	And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God . ”
43001035	The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples ,
43001036	and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God ! ”
43001037	The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Jesus .
43001038	Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them , “ What are you seeking ? ” And they said to him , “ Rabbi ” ( which means Teacher ) , “ where are you staying ? ”
43001039	He said to them , “ Come and you will see . ” So they came and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day , for it was about the tenth hour .
43001040	One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother .
43001041	He first found his own brother Simon and said to him , “ We have found the Messiah ” ( which means Christ ) .
43001042	He brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ So you are Simon the son of John ? You shall be called Cephas ” ( which means Peter ) .
43001043	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow me . ”
43001044	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and said to him , “ We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . ”
43001046	Nathanael said to him , “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see . ”
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him , “ Behold , an Israelite indeed , in whom there is no deceit ! ”
43001048	Nathanael said to him , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered him , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . ”
43001049	Nathanael answered him , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! You are the King of Israel ! ”
43001050	Jesus answered him , “ Because I said to you , ‘ I saw you under the fig tree , ’ do you believe ? You will see greater things than these . ”
43001051	And he said to him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . ”
43002001	On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there .
43002002	Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples .
43002003	When the wine ran out , the mother of Jesus said to him , “ They have no wine . ”
43002004	And Jesus said to her , “ Woman , what does this have to do with me ? My hour has not yet come . ”
43002005	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you . ”
43002006	Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification , each holding twenty or thirty gallons .
43002007	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the jars with water . ” And they filled them up to the brim .
43002008	And he said to them , “ Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast . ” So they took it .
43002009	When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine , and did not know where it came from ( though the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the master of the feast called the bridegroom
43002010	and said to him , “ Everyone serves the good wine first , and when people have drunk freely , then the poor wine . But you have kept the good wine until now . ”
43002011	This , the first of his signs , Jesus did at Cana in Galilee , and manifested his glory . And his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this he went down to Capernaum , with his mother and his brothers and his disciples , and they stayed there for a few days .
43002013	The Passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons , and the money-changers sitting there .
43002015	And making a whip of cords , he drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and oxen . And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables .
43002016	And he told those who sold the pigeons , “ Take these things away ; do not make my Father’s house a house of trade . ”
43002017	His disciples remembered that it was written , “ Zeal for your house will consume me . ”
43002018	So the Jews said to him , “ What sign do you show us for doing these things ? ”
43002019	Jesus answered them , “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . ”
43002020	The Jews then said , “ It has taken forty-six years to build this temple , and will you raise it up in three days ? ”
43002021	But he was speaking about the temple of his body .
43002022	When therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this , and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken .
43002023	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast , many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing .
43002024	But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them , because he knew all people
43002025	and needed no one to bear witness about man , for he himself knew what was in man .
43003001	Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews .
43003002	This man came to Jesus by night and said to him , “ Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher come from God , for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him . ”
43003003	Jesus answered him , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God . ”
43003004	Nicodemus said to him , “ How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born ? ”
43003005	Jesus answered , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless one is born of water and the Spirit , he cannot enter the kingdom of God .
43003006	That which is born of the flesh is flesh , and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Do not marvel that I said to you , ‘ You must be born again . ’
43003008	The wind blows where it wishes , and you hear its sound , but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit . ”
43003009	Nicodemus said to him , “ How can these things be ? ”
43003010	Jesus answered him , “ Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things ?
43003011	Truly , truly , I say to you , we speak of what we know , and bear witness to what we have seen , but you do not receive our testimony .
43003012	If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe , how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven , the Son of Man .
43003014	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
43003015	that whoever believes in him may have eternal life .
43003016	“ For God so loved the world , that he gave his only Son , that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but in order that the world might be saved through him .
43003018	Whoever believes in him is not condemned , but whoever does not believe is condemned already , because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God .
43003019	And this is the judgment : the light has come into the world , and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil .
43003020	For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light , lest his works should be exposed .
43003021	But whoever does what is true comes to the light , so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God . ”
43003022	After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside , and he remained there with them and was baptizing .
43003023	John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because water was plentiful there , and people were coming and being baptized
43003024	( for John had not yet been put in prison ) .
43003025	Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a Jew over purification .
43003026	And they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , he who was with you across the Jordan , to whom you bore witness — look , he is baptizing , and all are going to him . ”
43003027	John answered , “ A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves bear me witness , that I said , ‘ I am not the Christ , but I have been sent before him . ’
43003029	The one who has the bride is the bridegroom . The friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice . Therefore this joy of mine is now complete .
43003030	He must increase , but I must decrease . ”
43003031	He who comes from above is above all . He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way . He who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	He bears witness to what he has seen and heard , yet no one receives his testimony .
43003033	Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this , that God is true .
43003034	For he whom God has sent utters the words of God , for he gives the Spirit without measure .
43003035	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand .
43003036	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life ; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God remains on him .
43004001	Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
43004002	( although Jesus himself did not baptize , but only his disciples ) ,
43004003	he left Judea and departed again for Galilee .
43004004	And he had to pass through Samaria .
43004005	So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar , near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob’s well was there ; so Jesus , wearied as he was from his journey , was sitting beside the well . It was about the sixth hour .
43004007	A woman from Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give me a drink . ”
43004008	( For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food .
43004009	The Samaritan woman said to him , “ How is it that you , a Jew , ask for a drink from me , a woman of Samaria ? ” ( For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans .
43004010	Jesus answered her , “ If you knew the gift of God , and who it is that is saying to you , ‘ Give me a drink , ’ you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . ”
43004011	The woman said to him , “ Sir , you have nothing to draw water with , and the well is deep . Where do you get that living water ?
43004012	Are you greater than our father Jacob ? He gave us the well and drank from it himself , as did his sons and his livestock . ”
43004013	Jesus said to her , “ Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again ,
43004014	but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again . The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life . ”
43004015	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water , so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water . ”
43004016	Jesus said to her , “ Go , call your husband , and come here . ”
43004017	The woman answered him , “ I have no husband . ” Jesus said to her , “ You are right in saying , ‘ I have no husband ’ ;
43004018	for you have had five husbands , and the one you now have is not your husband . What you have said is true . ”
43004019	The woman said to him , “ Sir , I perceive that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship . ”
43004021	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , believe me , the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father .
43004022	You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we know , for salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But the hour is coming , and is now here , when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father is seeking such people to worship him .
43004024	God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . ”
43004025	The woman said to him , “ I know that Messiah is coming ( he who is called Christ ) . When he comes , he will tell us all things . ”
43004026	Jesus said to her , “ I who speak to you am he . ”
43004027	Just then his disciples came back . They marveled that he was talking with a woman , but no one said , “ What do you seek ? ” or , “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
43004028	So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people ,
43004029	“ Come , see a man who told me all that I ever did . Can this be the Christ ? ”
43004030	They went out of the town and were coming to him .
43004031	Meanwhile the disciples were urging him , saying , “ Rabbi , eat . ”
43004032	But he said to them , “ I have food to eat that you do not know about . ”
43004033	So the disciples said to one another , “ Has anyone brought him something to eat ? ”
43004034	Jesus said to them , “ My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work .
43004035	Do you not say , ‘ There are yet four months , then comes the harvest ’ ? Look , I tell you , lift up your eyes , and see that the fields are white for harvest .
43004036	Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life , so that sower and reaper may rejoice together .
43004037	For here the saying holds true , ‘ One sows and another reaps . ’
43004038	I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor . Others have labored , and you have entered into their labor . ”
43004039	Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony , “ He told me all that I ever did . ”
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to him , they asked him to stay with them , and he stayed there two days .
43004041	And many more believed because of his word .
43004042	They said to the woman , “ It is no longer because of what you said that we believe , for we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world . ”
43004043	After the two days he departed for Galilee .
43004044	( For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown .
43004045	So when he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him , having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast . For they too had gone to the feast .
43004046	So he came again to Cana in Galilee , where he had made the water wine . And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill .
43004047	When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
43004048	So Jesus said to him , “ Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe . ”
43004049	The official said to him , “ Sir , come down before my child dies . ”
43004050	Jesus said to him , “ Go ; your son will live . ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way .
43004051	As he was going down , his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering .
43004052	So he asked them the hour when he began to get better , and they said to him , “ Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . ”
43004053	The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him , “ Your son will live . ” And he himself believed , and all his household .
43004054	This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	After this there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool , in Aramaic called Bethesda , which has five roofed colonnades .
43005003	In these lay a multitude of invalids — blind , lame , and paralyzed .
43005005	One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time , he said to him , “ Do you want to be healed ? ”
43005007	The sick man answered him , “ Sir , I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up , and while I am going another steps down before me . ”
43005008	Jesus said to him , “ Get up , take up your bed , and walk . ”
43005009	And at once the man was healed , and he took up his bed and walked . Now that day was the Sabbath .
43005010	So the Jews said to the man who had been healed , “ It is the Sabbath , and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed . ”
43005011	But he answered them , “ The man who healed me , that man said to me , ‘ Take up your bed , and walk . ’ ”
43005012	They asked him , “ Who is the man who said to you , ‘ Take up your bed and walk ’ ? ”
43005013	Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had withdrawn , as there was a crowd in the place .
43005014	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him , “ See , you are well ! Sin no more , that nothing worse may happen to you . ”
43005015	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him .
43005016	And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus , because he was doing these things on the Sabbath .
43005017	But Jesus answered them , “ My Father is working until now , and I am working . ”
43005018	This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him , because not only was he breaking the Sabbath , but he was even calling God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
43005019	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , the Son can do nothing of his own accord , but only what he sees the Father doing . For whatever the Father does , that the Son does likewise .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing . And greater works than these will he show him , so that you may marvel .
43005021	For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so also the Son gives life to whom he will .
43005022	The Father judges no one , but has given all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	that all may honor the Son , just as they honor the Father . Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	Truly , truly , I say to you , whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life . He does not come into judgment , but has passed from death to life .
43005025	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , an hour is coming , and is now here , when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear will live .
43005026	For as the Father has life in himself , so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself .
43005027	And he has given him authority to execute judgment , because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	Do not marvel at this , for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
43005029	and come out , those who have done good to the resurrection of life , and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment .
43005030	“ I can do nothing on my own . As I hear , I judge , and my judgment is just , because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me .
43005031	If I alone bear witness about myself , my testimony is not deemed true .
43005032	There is another who bears witness about me , and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true .
43005033	You sent to John , and he has borne witness to the truth .
43005034	Not that the testimony that I receive is from man , but I say these things so that you may be saved .
43005035	He was a burning and shining lamp , and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light .
43005036	But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John . For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish , the very works that I am doing , bear witness about me that the Father has sent me .
43005037	And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me . His voice you have never heard , his form you have never seen ,
43005038	and you do not have his word abiding in you , for you do not believe the one whom he has sent .
43005039	You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and it is they that bear witness about me ,
43005040	yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life .
43005041	I do not receive glory from people .
43005042	But I know that you do not have the love of God within you .
43005043	I have come in my Father’s name , and you do not receive me . If another comes in his own name , you will receive him .
43005044	How can you believe , when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
43005045	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father . There is one who accuses you : Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
43005046	For if you believed Moses , you would believe me ; for he wrote of me .
43005047	But if you do not believe his writings , how will you believe my words ? ”
43006001	After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee , which is the Sea of Tiberias .
43006002	And a large crowd was following him , because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick .
43006003	Jesus went up on the mountain , and there he sat down with his disciples .
43006004	Now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was at hand .
43006005	Lifting up his eyes , then , and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him , Jesus said to Philip , “ Where are we to buy bread , so that these people may eat ? ”
43006006	He said this to test him , for he himself knew what he would do .
43006007	Philip answered him , “ Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little . ”
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , said to him ,
43006009	“ There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish , but what are they for so many ? ”
43006010	Jesus said , “ Have the people sit down . ” Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , about five thousand in number .
43006011	Jesus then took the loaves , and when he had given thanks , he distributed them to those who were seated . So also the fish , as much as they wanted .
43006012	And when they had eaten their fill , he told his disciples , “ Gather up the leftover fragments , that nothing may be lost . ”
43006013	So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten .
43006014	When the people saw the sign that he had done , they said , “ This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world ! ”
43006015	Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king , Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
43006016	When evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ,
43006017	got into a boat , and started across the sea to Capernaum . It was now dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
43006018	The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing .
43006019	When they had rowed about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat , and they were frightened .
43006020	But he said to them , “ It is I ; do not be afraid . ”
43006021	Then they were glad to take him into the boat , and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going .
43006022	On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there , and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples , but that his disciples had gone away alone .
43006023	Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum , seeking Jesus .
43006025	When they found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , “ Rabbi , when did you come here ? ”
43006026	Jesus answered them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , you are seeking me , not because you saw signs , but because you ate your fill of the loaves .
43006027	Do not labor for the food that perishes , but for the food that endures to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you . For on him God the Father has set his seal . ”
43006028	Then they said to him , “ What must we do , to be doing the works of God ? ”
43006029	Jesus answered them , “ This is the work of God , that you believe in him whom he has sent . ”
43006030	So they said to him , “ Then what sign do you do , that we may see and believe you ? What work do you perform ?
43006031	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
43006032	Jesus then said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
43006034	They said to him , “ Sir , give us this bread always . ”
43006035	Jesus said to them , “ I am the bread of life ; whoever comes to me shall not hunger , and whoever believes in me shall never thirst .
43006036	But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe .
43006037	All that the Father gives me will come to me , and whoever comes to me I will never cast out .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven , not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me .
43006039	And this is the will of him who sent me , that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me , but raise it up on the last day .
43006040	For this is the will of my Father , that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day . ”
43006041	So the Jews grumbled about him , because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven . ”
43006042	They said , “ Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How does he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
43006043	Jesus answered them , “ Do not grumble among yourselves .
43006044	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him . And I will raise him up on the last day .
43006045	It is written in the Prophets , ‘ And they will all be taught by God . ’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me —
43006046	not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God ; he has seen the Father .
43006047	Truly , truly , I say to you , whoever believes has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
43006050	This is the bread that comes down from heaven , so that one may eat of it and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . If anyone eats of this bread , he will live forever . And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh . ”
43006052	The Jews then disputed among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
43006053	So Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you have no life in you .
43006054	Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
43006056	Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me , and I in him .
43006057	As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so whoever feeds on me , he also will live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread that came down from heaven , not like the bread the fathers ate and died . Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever . ”
43006059	Jesus said these things in the synagogue , as he taught at Capernaum .
43006060	When many of his disciples heard it , they said , “ This is a hard saying ; who can listen to it ? ”
43006061	But Jesus , knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this , said to them , “ Do you take offense at this ?
43006062	Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before ?
43006063	It is the Spirit who gives life ; the flesh is no help at all . The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life .
43006064	But there are some of you who do not believe . ” ( For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe , and who it was who would betray him .
43006065	And he said , “ This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father . ”
43006066	After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him .
43006067	So Jesus said to the Twelve , “ Do you want to go away as well ? ”
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life ,
43006069	and we have believed , and have come to know , that you are the Holy One of God . ”
43006070	Jesus answered them , “ Did I not choose you , the Twelve ? And yet one of you is a devil . ”
43006071	He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot , for he , one of the Twelve , was going to betray him .
43007001	After this Jesus went about in Galilee . He would not go about in Judea , because the Jews were seeking to kill him .
43007002	Now the Jews ’ Feast of Booths was at hand .
43007003	So his brothers said to him , “ Leave here and go to Judea , that your disciples also may see the works you are doing .
43007004	For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly . If you do these things , show yourself to the world . ”
43007005	For not even his brothers believed in him .
43007006	Jesus said to them , “ My time has not yet come , but your time is always here .
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil .
43007008	You go up to the feast . I am not going up to this feast , for my time has not yet fully come . ”
43007009	After saying this , he remained in Galilee .
43007010	But after his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly but in private .
43007011	The Jews were looking for him at the feast , and saying , “ Where is he ? ”
43007012	And there was much muttering about him among the people . While some said , “ He is a good man , ” others said , “ No , he is leading the people astray . ”
43007013	Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him .
43007014	About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching .
43007015	The Jews therefore marveled , saying , “ How is it that this man has learning , when he has never studied ? ”
43007016	So Jesus answered them , “ My teaching is not mine , but his who sent me .
43007017	If anyone’s will is to do God’s will , he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority .
43007018	The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory ; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and in him there is no falsehood .
43007019	Has not Moses given you the law ? Yet none of you keeps the law . Why do you seek to kill me ? ”
43007020	The crowd answered , “ You have a demon ! Who is seeking to kill you ? ”
43007021	Jesus answered them , “ I did one work , and you all marvel at it .
43007022	Moses gave you circumcision ( not that it is from Moses , but from the fathers ) , and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
43007023	If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision , so that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man’s whole body well ?
43007024	Do not judge by appearances , but judge with right judgment . ”
43007025	Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said , “ Is not this the man whom they seek to kill ?
43007026	And here he is , speaking openly , and they say nothing to him ! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ ?
43007027	But we know where this man comes from , and when the Christ appears , no one will know where he comes from . ”
43007028	So Jesus proclaimed , as he taught in the temple , “ You know me , and you know where I come from ? But I have not come of my own accord . He who sent me is true , and him you do not know .
43007029	I know him , for I come from him , and he sent me . ”
43007030	So they were seeking to arrest him , but no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
43007031	Yet many of the people believed in him . They said , “ When the Christ appears , will he do more signs than this man has done ? ”
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him , and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
43007033	Jesus then said , “ I will be with you a little longer , and then I am going to him who sent me .
43007034	You will seek me and you will not find me . Where I am you cannot come . ”
43007035	The Jews said to one another , “ Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him ? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What does he mean by saying , ‘ You will seek me and you will not find me , ’ and , ‘ Where I am you cannot come ’ ? ”
43007037	On the last day of the feast , the great day , Jesus stood up and cried out , “ If anyone thirsts , let him come to me and drink .
43007038	Whoever believes in me , as the Scripture has said , ‘ Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water . ’ ”
43007039	Now this he said about the Spirit , whom those who believed in him were to receive , for as yet the Spirit had not been given , because Jesus was not yet glorified .
43007040	When they heard these words , some of the people said , “ This really is the Prophet . ”
43007041	Others said , “ This is the Christ . ” But some said , “ Is the Christ to come from Galilee ?
43007042	Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David , and comes from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? ”
43007043	So there was a division among the people over him .
43007044	Some of them wanted to arrest him , but no one laid hands on him .
43007045	The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees , who said to them , “ Why did you not bring him ? ”
43007046	The officers answered , “ No one ever spoke like this man ! ”
43007047	The Pharisees answered them , “ Have you also been deceived ?
43007048	Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him ?
43007049	But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed . ”
43007050	Nicodemus , who had gone to him before , and who was one of them , said to them ,
43007051	“ Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does ? ”
43007052	They replied , “ Are you from Galilee too ? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee . ”
43007053	[ [ They went each to his own house ,
43008001	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	Early in the morning he came again to the temple . All the people came to him , and he sat down and taught them .
43008003	The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery , and placing her in the midst
43008004	they said to him , “ Teacher , this woman has been caught in the act of adultery .
43008005	Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women . So what do you say ? ”
43008006	This they said to test him , that they might have some charge to bring against him . Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground .
43008007	And as they continued to ask him , he stood up and said to them , “ Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her . ”
43008008	And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground .
43008009	But when they heard it , they went away one by one , beginning with the older ones , and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him .
43008010	Jesus stood up and said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? ”
43008011	She said , “ No one , Lord . ” And Jesus said , “ Neither do I condemn you ; go , and from now on sin no more . ” ] ]
43008012	Again Jesus spoke to them , saying , “ I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . ”
43008013	So the Pharisees said to him , “ You are bearing witness about yourself ; your testimony is not true . ”
43008014	Jesus answered , “ Even if I do bear witness about myself , my testimony is true , for I know where I came from and where I am going , but you do not know where I come from or where I am going .
43008015	You judge according to the flesh ; I judge no one .
43008016	Yet even if I do judge , my judgment is true , for it is not I alone who judge , but I and the Father who sent me .
43008017	In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true .
43008018	I am the one who bears witness about myself , and the Father who sent me bears witness about me . ”
43008019	They said to him therefore , “ Where is your Father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You know neither me nor my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father also . ”
43008020	These words he spoke in the treasury , as he taught in the temple ; but no one arrested him , because his hour had not yet come .
43008021	So he said to them again , “ I am going away , and you will seek me , and you will die in your sin . Where I am going , you cannot come . ”
43008022	So the Jews said , “ Will he kill himself , since he says , ‘ Where I am going , you cannot come ’ ? ”
43008023	He said to them , “ You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ; I am not of this world .
43008024	I told you that you would die in your sins , for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins . ”
43008025	So they said to him , “ Who are you ? ” Jesus said to them , “ Just what I have been telling you from the beginning .
43008026	I have much to say about you and much to judge , but he who sent me is true , and I declare to the world what I have heard from him . ”
43008027	They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father .
43008028	So Jesus said to them , “ When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and that I do nothing on my own authority , but speak just as the Father taught me .
43008029	And he who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , for I always do the things that are pleasing to him . ”
43008030	As he was saying these things , many believed in him .
43008031	So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him , “ If you abide in my word , you are truly my disciples ,
43008032	and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
43008033	They answered him , “ We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone . How is it that you say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ”
43008034	Jesus answered them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin .
43008035	The slave does not remain in the house forever ; the son remains forever .
43008036	So if the Son sets you free , you will be free indeed .
43008037	I know that you are offspring of Abraham ; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you .
43008038	I speak of what I have seen with my Father , and you do what you have heard from your father . ”
43008039	They answered him , “ Abraham is our father . ” Jesus said to them , “ If you were Abraham’s children , you would be doing the works Abraham did ,
43008040	but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God . This is not what Abraham did .
43008041	You are doing the works your father did . ” They said to him , “ We were not born of sexual immorality . We have one Father — even God . ”
43008042	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your Father , you would love me , for I came from God and I am here . I came not of my own accord , but he sent me .
43008043	Why do you not understand what I say ? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word .
43008044	You are of your father the devil , and your will is to do your father’s desires . He was a murderer from the beginning , and has nothing to do with the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks out of his own character , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
43008045	But because I tell the truth , you do not believe me .
43008046	Which one of you convicts me of sin ? If I tell the truth , why do you not believe me ?
43008047	Whoever is of God hears the words of God . The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God . ”
43008048	The Jews answered him , “ Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon ? ”
43008049	Jesus answered , “ I do not have a demon , but I honor my Father , and you dishonor me .
43008050	Yet I do not seek my own glory ; there is One who seeks it , and he is the judge .
43008051	Truly , truly , I say to you , if anyone keeps my word , he will never see death . ”
43008052	The Jews said to him , “ Now we know that you have a demon ! Abraham died , as did the prophets , yet you say , ‘ If anyone keeps my word , he will never taste death . ’
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham , who died ? And the prophets died ! Who do you make yourself out to be ? ”
43008054	Jesus answered , “ If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . It is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say , ‘ He is our God . ’
43008055	But you have not known him . I know him . If I were to say that I do not know him , I would be a liar like you , but I do know him and I keep his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day . He saw it and was glad . ”
43008057	So the Jews said to him , “ You are not yet fifty years old , and have you seen Abraham ? ”
43008058	Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , before Abraham was , I am . ”
43008059	So they picked up stones to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple .
43009001	As he passed by , he saw a man blind from birth .
43009002	And his disciples asked him , “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? ”
43009003	Jesus answered , “ It was not that this man sinned , or his parents , but that the works of God might be displayed in him .
43009004	We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day ; night is coming , when no one can work .
43009005	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ”
43009006	Having said these things , he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva . Then he anointed the man’s eyes with the mud
43009007	and said to him , “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( which means Sent ) . So he went and washed and came back seeing .
43009008	The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying , “ Is this not the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
43009009	Some said , “ It is he . ” Others said , “ No , but he is like him . ” He kept saying , “ I am the man . ”
43009010	So they said to him , “ Then how were your eyes opened ? ”
43009011	He answered , “ The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me , ‘ Go to Siloam and wash . ’ So I went and washed and received my sight . ”
43009012	They said to him , “ Where is he ? ” He said , “ I do not know . ”
43009013	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind .
43009014	Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes .
43009015	So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight . And he said to them , “ He put mud on my eyes , and I washed , and I see . ”
43009016	Some of the Pharisees said , “ This man is not from God , for he does not keep the Sabbath . ” But others said , “ How can a man who is a sinner do such signs ? ” And there was a division among them .
43009017	So they said again to the blind man , “ What do you say about him , since he has opened your eyes ? ” He said , “ He is a prophet . ”
43009018	The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight , until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight
43009019	and asked them , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How then does he now see ? ”
43009020	His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
43009021	But how he now sees we do not know , nor do we know who opened his eyes . Ask him ; he is of age . He will speak for himself . ”
43009022	( His parents said these things because they feared the Jews , for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ , he was to be put out of the synagogue .
43009023	Therefore his parents said , “ He is of age ; ask him . ”
43009024	So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him , “ Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner . ”
43009025	He answered , “ Whether he is a sinner I do not know . One thing I do know , that though I was blind , now I see . ”
43009026	They said to him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
43009027	He answered them , “ I have told you already , and you would not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you also want to become his disciples ? ”
43009028	And they reviled him , saying , “ You are his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
43009029	We know that God has spoken to Moses , but as for this man , we do not know where he comes from . ”
43009030	The man answered , “ Why , this is an amazing thing ! You do not know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
43009031	We know that God does not listen to sinners , but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will , God listens to him .
43009032	Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind .
43009033	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . ”
43009034	They answered him , “ You were born in utter sin , and would you teach us ? ” And they cast him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out , and having found him he said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
43009036	He answered , “ And who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? ”
43009037	Jesus said to him , “ You have seen him , and it is he who is speaking to you . ”
43009038	He said , “ Lord , I believe , ” and he worshiped him .
43009039	Jesus said , “ For judgment I came into this world , that those who do not see may see , and those who see may become blind . ”
43009040	Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things , and said to him , “ Are we also blind ? ”
43009041	Jesus said to them , “ If you were blind , you would have no guilt ; but now that you say , ‘ We see , ’ your guilt remains .
43010001	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way , that man is a thief and a robber .
43010002	But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	To him the gatekeeper opens . The sheep hear his voice , and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	When he has brought out all his own , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
43010005	A stranger they will not follow , but they will flee from him , for they do not know the voice of strangers . ”
43010006	This figure of speech Jesus used with them , but they did not understand what he was saying to them .
43010007	So Jesus again said to them , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
43010008	All who came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the door . If anyone enters by me , he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy . I came that they may have life and have it abundantly .
43010011	I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
43010012	He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd , who does not own the sheep , sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees , and the wolf snatches them and scatters them .
43010013	He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep .
43010014	I am the good shepherd . I know my own and my own know me ,
43010015	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father ; and I lay down my life for the sheep .
43010016	And I have other sheep that are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will listen to my voice . So there will be one flock , one shepherd .
43010017	For this reason the Father loves me , because I lay down my life that I may take it up again .
43010018	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of my own accord . I have authority to lay it down , and I have authority to take it up again . This charge I have received from my Father . ”
43010019	There was again a division among the Jews because of these words .
43010020	Many of them said , “ He has a demon , and is insane ; why listen to him ? ”
43010021	Others said , “ These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ”
43010022	At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
43010023	and Jesus was walking in the temple , in the colonnade of Solomon .
43010024	So the Jews gathered around him and said to him , “ How long will you keep us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . ”
43010025	Jesus answered them , “ I told you , and you do not believe . The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me ,
43010026	but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock .
43010027	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life , and they will never perish , and no one will snatch them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all , and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand .
43010030	I and the Father are one . ”
43010031	The Jews picked up stones again to stone him .
43010032	Jesus answered them , “ I have shown you many good works from the Father ; for which of them are you going to stone me ? ”
43010033	The Jews answered him , “ It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy , because you , being a man , make yourself God . ”
43010034	Jesus answered them , “ Is it not written in your Law , ‘ I said , you are gods ’ ?
43010035	If he called them gods to whom the word of God came — and Scripture cannot be broken —
43010036	do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ because I said , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ?
43010037	If I am not doing the works of my Father , then do not believe me ;
43010038	but if I do them , even though you do not believe me , believe the works , that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father . ”
43010039	Again they sought to arrest him , but he escaped from their hands .
43010040	He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first , and there he remained .
43010041	And many came to him . And they said , “ John did no sign , but everything that John said about this man was true . ”
43010042	And many believed in him there .
43011001	Now a certain man was ill , Lazarus of Bethany , the village of Mary and her sister Martha .
43011002	It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was ill .
43011003	So the sisters sent to him , saying , “ Lord , he whom you love is ill . ”
43011004	But when Jesus heard it he said , “ This illness does not lead to death . It is for the glory of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified through it . ”
43011005	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	So , when he heard that Lazarus was ill , he stayed two days longer in the place where he was .
43011007	Then after this he said to the disciples , “ Let us go to Judea again . ”
43011008	The disciples said to him , “ Rabbi , the Jews were just now seeking to stone you , and are you going there again ? ”
43011009	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	But if anyone walks in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . ”
43011011	After saying these things , he said to them , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I go to awaken him . ”
43011012	The disciples said to him , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover . ”
43011013	Now Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep .
43011014	Then Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus has died ,
43011015	and for your sake I am glad that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him . ”
43011016	So Thomas , called the Twin , said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us also go , that we may die with him . ”
43011017	Now when Jesus came , he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days .
43011018	Bethany was near Jerusalem , about two miles off ,
43011019	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother .
43011020	So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went and met him , but Mary remained seated in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	But even now I know that whatever you ask from God , God will give you . ”
43011023	Jesus said to her , “ Your brother will rise again . ”
43011024	Martha said to him , “ I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day . ”
43011025	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Whoever believes in me , though he die , yet shall he live ,
43011026	and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die . Do you believe this ? ”
43011027	She said to him , “ Yes , Lord ; I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , who is coming into the world . ”
43011028	When she had said this , she went and called her sister Mary , saying in private , “ The Teacher is here and is calling for you . ”
43011029	And when she heard it , she rose quickly and went to him .
43011030	Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha had met him .
43011031	When the Jews who were with her in the house , consoling her , saw Mary rise quickly and go out , they followed her , supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
43011032	Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet , saying to him , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43011033	When Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who had come with her also weeping , he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled .
43011034	And he said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to him , “ Lord , come and see . ”
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	So the Jews said , “ See how he loved him ! ”
43011037	But some of them said , “ Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying ? ”
43011038	Then Jesus , deeply moved again , came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
43011039	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone . ” Martha , the sister of the dead man , said to him , “ Lord , by this time there will be an odor , for he has been dead four days . ”
43011040	Jesus said to her , “ Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God ? ”
43011041	So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said , “ Father , I thank you that you have heard me .
43011042	I knew that you always hear me , but I said this on account of the people standing around , that they may believe that you sent me . ”
43011043	When he had said these things , he cried out with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out . ”
43011044	The man who had died came out , his hands and feet bound with linen strips , and his face wrapped with a cloth . Jesus said to them , “ Unbind him , and let him go . ”
43011045	Many of the Jews therefore , who had come with Mary and had seen what he did , believed in him ,
43011046	but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said , “ What are we to do ? For this man performs many signs .
43011048	If we let him go on like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . ”
43011049	But one of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , said to them , “ You know nothing at all .
43011050	Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people , not that the whole nation should perish . ”
43011051	He did not say this of his own accord , but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation ,
43011052	and not for the nation only , but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad .
43011053	So from that day on they made plans to put him to death .
43011054	Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews , but went from there to the region near the wilderness , to a town called Ephraim , and there he stayed with the disciples .
43011055	Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand , and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves .
43011056	They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple , “ What do you think ? That he will not come to the feast at all ? ”
43011057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was , he should let them know , so that they might arrest him .
43012001	Six days before the Passover , Jesus therefore came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , whom Jesus had raised from the dead .
43012002	So they gave a dinner for him there . Martha served , and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table .
43012003	Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard , and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair . The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43012004	But Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples ( he who was about to betray him ) , said ,
43012005	“ Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor ? ”
43012006	He said this , not because he cared about the poor , but because he was a thief , and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it .
43012007	Jesus said , “ Leave her alone , so that she may keep it for the day of my burial .
43012008	For the poor you always have with you , but you do not always have me . ”
43012009	When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there , they came , not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well ,
43012011	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus .
43012012	The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
43012013	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him , crying out , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel ! ”
43012014	And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it , just as it is written ,
43012015	“ Fear not , daughter of Zion ; behold , your king is coming , sitting on a donkey’s colt ! ”
43012016	His disciples did not understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him .
43012017	The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness .
43012018	The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign .
43012019	So the Pharisees said to one another , “ You see that you are gaining nothing . Look , the world has gone after him . ”
43012020	Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks .
43012021	So these came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and asked him , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus . ”
43012022	Philip went and told Andrew ; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus .
43012023	And Jesus answered them , “ The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
43012024	Truly , truly , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it bears much fruit .
43012025	Whoever loves his life loses it , and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life .
43012026	If anyone serves me , he must follow me ; and where I am , there will my servant be also . If anyone serves me , the Father will honor him .
43012027	“ Now is my soul troubled . And what shall I say ? ‘ Father , save me from this hour ’ ? But for this purpose I have come to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify your name . ” Then a voice came from heaven : “ I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again . ”
43012029	The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered . Others said , “ An angel has spoken to him . ”
43012030	Jesus answered , “ This voice has come for your sake , not mine .
43012031	Now is the judgment of this world ; now will the ruler of this world be cast out .
43012032	And I , when I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all people to myself . ”
43012033	He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die .
43012034	So the crowd answered him , “ We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever . How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
43012035	So Jesus said to them , “ The light is among you for a little while longer . Walk while you have the light , lest darkness overtake you . The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become sons of light . ” When Jesus had said these things , he departed and hid himself from them .
43012037	Though he had done so many signs before them , they still did not believe in him ,
43012038	so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled : “ Lord , who has believed what he heard from us , and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
43012039	Therefore they could not believe . For again Isaiah said ,
43012040	“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart , lest they see with their eyes , and understand with their heart , and turn , and I would heal them . ”
43012041	Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him .
43012042	Nevertheless , many even of the authorities believed in him , but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it , so that they would not be put out of the synagogue ;
43012043	for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God .
43012044	And Jesus cried out and said , “ Whoever believes in me , believes not in me but in him who sent me .
43012045	And whoever sees me sees him who sent me .
43012046	I have come into the world as light , so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness .
43012047	If anyone hears my words and does not keep them , I do not judge him ; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world .
43012048	The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge ; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day .
43012049	For I have not spoken on my own authority , but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment — what to say and what to speak .
43012050	And I know that his commandment is eternal life . What I say , therefore , I say as the Father has told me . ”
43013001	Now before the Feast of the Passover , when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
43013002	During supper , when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon’s son , to betray him ,
43013003	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he had come from God and was going back to God ,
43013004	rose from supper . He laid aside his outer garments , and taking a towel , tied it around his waist .
43013005	Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples ’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
43013006	He came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Lord , do you wash my feet ? ”
43013007	Jesus answered him , “ What I am doing you do not understand now , but afterward you will understand . ”
43013008	Peter said to him , “ You shall never wash my feet . ” Jesus answered him , “ If I do not wash you , you have no share with me . ”
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , not my feet only but also my hands and my head ! ”
43013010	Jesus said to him , “ The one who has bathed does not need to wash , except for his feet , but is completely clean . And you are clean , but not every one of you . ”
43013011	For he knew who was to betray him ; that was why he said , “ Not all of you are clean . ”
43013012	When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place , he said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done to you ?
43013013	You call me Teacher and Lord , and you are right , for so I am .
43013014	If I then , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another’s feet .
43013015	For I have given you an example , that you also should do just as I have done to you .
43013016	Truly , truly , I say to you , a servant is not greater than his master , nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him .
43013017	If you know these things , blessed are you if you do them .
43013018	I am not speaking of all of you ; I know whom I have chosen . But the Scripture will be fulfilled , ‘ He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me . ’
43013019	I am telling you this now , before it takes place , that when it does take place you may believe that I am he .
43013020	Truly , truly , I say to you , whoever receives the one I send receives me , and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me . ”
43013021	After saying these things , Jesus was troubled in his spirit , and testified , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , one of you will betray me . ”
43013022	The disciples looked at one another , uncertain of whom he spoke .
43013023	One of his disciples , whom Jesus loved , was reclining at table close to Jesus ,
43013024	so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking .
43013025	So that disciple , leaning back against Jesus , said to him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
43013026	Jesus answered , “ It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it . ” So when he had dipped the morsel , he gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	Then after he had taken the morsel , Satan entered into him . Jesus said to him , “ What you are going to do , do quickly . ”
43013028	Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him .
43013029	Some thought that , because Judas had the moneybag , Jesus was telling him , “ Buy what we need for the feast , ” or that he should give something to the poor .
43013030	So , after receiving the morsel of bread , he immediately went out . And it was night .
43013031	When he had gone out , Jesus said , “ Now is the Son of Man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
43013032	If God is glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and glorify him at once .
43013033	Little children , yet a little while I am with you . You will seek me , and just as I said to the Jews , so now I also say to you , ‘ Where I am going you cannot come . ’
43013034	A new commandment I give to you , that you love one another : just as I have loved you , you also are to love one another .
43013035	By this all people will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . ”
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered him , “ Where I am going you cannot follow me now , but you will follow afterward . ”
43013037	Peter said to him , “ Lord , why can I not follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you . ”
43013038	Jesus answered , “ Will you lay down your life for me ? Truly , truly , I say to you , the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times .
43014001	“ Let not your hearts be troubled . Believe in God ; believe also in me .
43014002	In my Father’s house are many rooms . If it were not so , would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you ?
43014003	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and will take you to myself , that where I am you may be also .
43014004	And you know the way to where I am going . ”
43014005	Thomas said to him , “ Lord , we do not know where you are going . How can we know the way ? ”
43014006	Jesus said to him , “ I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
43014007	If you had known me , you would have known my Father also . From now on you do know him and have seen him . ”
43014008	Philip said to him , “ Lord , show us the Father , and it is enough for us . ”
43014009	Jesus said to him , “ Have I been with you so long , and you still do not know me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014010	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority , but the Father who dwells in me does his works .
43014011	Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me , or else believe on account of the works themselves .
43014012	“ Truly , truly , I say to you , whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do ; and greater works than these will he do , because I am going to the Father .
43014013	Whatever you ask in my name , this I will do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	If you ask me anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	“ If you love me , you will keep my commandments .
43014016	And I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Helper , to be with you forever ,
43014017	even the Spirit of truth , whom the world cannot receive , because it neither sees him nor knows him . You know him , for he dwells with you and will be in you .
43014018	“ I will not leave you as orphans ; I will come to you .
43014019	Yet a little while and the world will see me no more , but you will see me . Because I live , you also will live .
43014020	In that day you will know that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
43014021	Whoever has my commandments and keeps them , he it is who loves me . And he who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and manifest myself to him . ”
43014022	Judas ( not Iscariot
43014023	Jesus answered him , “ If anyone loves me , he will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and make our home with him .
43014024	Whoever does not love me does not keep my words . And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me .
43014025	“ These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you .
43014026	But the Helper , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you .
43014027	Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give to you . Not as the world gives do I give to you . Let not your hearts be troubled , neither let them be afraid .
43014028	You heard me say to you , ‘ I am going away , and I will come to you . ’ If you loved me , you would have rejoiced , because I am going to the Father , for the Father is greater than I .
43014029	And now I have told you before it takes place , so that when it does take place you may believe .
43014030	I will no longer talk much with you , for the ruler of this world is coming . He has no claim on me ,
43014031	but I do as the Father has commanded me , so that the world may know that I love the Father . Rise , let us go from here .
43015001	“ I am the true vine , and my Father is the vinedresser .
43015002	Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away , and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes , that it may bear more fruit .
43015003	Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you .
43015004	Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself , unless it abides in the vine , neither can you , unless you abide in me .
43015005	I am the vine ; you are the branches . Whoever abides in me and I in him , he it is that bears much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
43015006	If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers ; and the branches are gathered , thrown into the fire , and burned .
43015007	If you abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask whatever you wish , and it will be done for you .
43015008	By this my Father is glorified , that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples .
43015009	As the Father has loved me , so have I loved you . Abide in my love .
43015010	If you keep my commandments , you will abide in my love , just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love .
43015011	These things I have spoken to you , that my joy may be in you , and that your joy may be full .
43015012	“ This is my commandment , that you love one another as I have loved you .
43015013	Greater love has no one than this , that someone lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	No longer do I call you servants , for the servant does not know what his master is doing ; but I have called you friends , for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you .
43015016	You did not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide , so that whatever you ask the Father in my name , he may give it to you .
43015017	These things I command you , so that you will love one another .
43015018	“ If the world hates you , know that it has hated me before it hated you .
43015019	If you were of the world , the world would love you as its own ; but because you are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hates you .
43015020	Remember the word that I said to you : ‘ A servant is not greater than his master . ’ If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . If they kept my word , they will also keep yours .
43015021	But all these things they will do to you on account of my name , because they do not know him who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have been guilty of sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	Whoever hates me hates my Father also .
43015024	If I had not done among them the works that no one else did , they would not be guilty of sin , but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father .
43015025	But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled : ‘ They hated me without a cause . ’
43015026	“ But when the Helper comes , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will bear witness about me .
43015027	And you also will bear witness , because you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	“ I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away .
43016002	They will put you out of the synagogues . Indeed , the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God .
43016003	And they will do these things because they have not known the Father , nor me .
43016004	But I have said these things to you , that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you . “ I did not say these things to you from the beginning , because I was with you .
43016005	But now I am going to him who sent me , and none of you asks me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016006	But because I have said these things to you , sorrow has filled your heart .
43016007	Nevertheless , I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I do not go away , the Helper will not come to you . But if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	And when he comes , he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment :
43016009	concerning sin , because they do not believe in me ;
43016010	concerning righteousness , because I go to the Father , and you will see me no longer ;
43016011	concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world is judged .
43016012	“ I still have many things to say to you , but you cannot bear them now .
43016013	When the Spirit of truth comes , he will guide you into all the truth , for he will not speak on his own authority , but whatever he hears he will speak , and he will declare to you the things that are to come .
43016014	He will glorify me , for he will take what is mine and declare it to you .
43016015	All that the Father has is mine ; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you .
43016016	“ A little while , and you will see me no longer ; and again a little while , and you will see me . ”
43016017	So some of his disciples said to one another , “ What is this that he says to us , ‘ A little while , and you will not see me , and again a little while , and you will see me ’ ; and , ‘ because I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
43016018	So they were saying , “ What does he mean by ‘ a little while ’ ? We do not know what he is talking about . ”
43016019	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him , so he said to them , “ Is this what you are asking yourselves , what I meant by saying , ‘ A little while and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me ’ ?
43016020	Truly , truly , I say to you , you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will turn into joy .
43016021	When a woman is giving birth , she has sorrow because her hour has come , but when she has delivered the baby , she no longer remembers the anguish , for joy that a human being has been born into the world .
43016022	So also you have sorrow now , but I will see you again , and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will take your joy from you .
43016023	In that day you will ask nothing of me . Truly , truly , I say to you , whatever you ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
43016024	Until now you have asked nothing in my name . Ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be full .
43016025	“ I have said these things to you in figures of speech . The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father .
43016026	In that day you will ask in my name , and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf ;
43016027	for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God .
43016028	I came from the Father and have come into the world , and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father . ”
43016029	His disciples said , “ Ah , now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech !
43016030	Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you ; this is why we believe that you came from God . ”
43016031	Jesus answered them , “ Do you now believe ?
43016032	Behold , the hour is coming , indeed it has come , when you will be scattered , each to his own home , and will leave me alone . Yet I am not alone , for the Father is with me .
43016033	I have said these things to you , that in me you may have peace . In the world you will have tribulation . But take heart ; I have overcome the world . ”
43017001	When Jesus had spoken these words , he lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , “ Father , the hour has come ; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you ,
43017002	since you have given him authority over all flesh , to give eternal life to all whom you have given him .
43017003	And this is eternal life , that they know you the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom you have sent .
43017004	I glorified you on earth , having accomplished the work that you gave me to do .
43017005	And now , Father , glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed .
43017006	“ I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world . Yours they were , and you gave them to me , and they have kept your word .
43017007	Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you .
43017008	For I have given them the words that you gave me , and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you ; and they have believed that you sent me .
43017009	I am praying for them . I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me , for they are yours .
43017010	All mine are yours , and yours are mine , and I am glorified in them .
43017011	And I am no longer in the world , but they are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them in your name , which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are one .
43017012	While I was with them , I kept them in your name , which you have given me . I have guarded them , and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
43017013	But now I am coming to you , and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
43017014	I have given them your word , and the world has hated them because they are not of the world , just as I am not of the world .
43017015	I do not ask that you take them out of the world , but that you keep them from the evil one .
43017016	They are not of the world , just as I am not of the world .
43017017	Sanctify them in the truth ; your word is truth .
43017018	As you sent me into the world , so I have sent them into the world .
43017019	And for their sake I consecrate myself , that they also may be sanctified in truth .
43017020	“ I do not ask for these only , but also for those who will believe in me through their word ,
43017021	that they may all be one , just as you , Father , are in me , and I in you , that they also may be in us , so that the world may believe that you have sent me .
43017022	The glory that you have given me I have given to them , that they may be one even as we are one ,
43017023	I in them and you in me , that they may become perfectly one , so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me .
43017024	Father , I desire that they also , whom you have given me , may be with me where I am , to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world .
43017025	O righteous Father , even though the world does not know you , I know you , and these know that you have sent me .
43017026	I made known to them your name , and I will continue to make it known , that the love with which you have loved me may be in them , and I in them . ”
43018001	When Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley , where there was a garden , which he and his disciples entered .
43018002	Now Judas , who betrayed him , also knew the place , for Jesus often met there with his disciples .
43018003	So Judas , having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , went there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
43018004	Then Jesus , knowing all that would happen to him , came forward and said to them , “ Whom do you seek ? ”
43018005	They answered him , “ Jesus of Nazareth . ” Jesus said to them , “ I am he . ” Judas , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
43018006	When Jesus said to them , “ I am he , ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
43018007	So he asked them again , “ Whom do you seek ? ” And they said , “ Jesus of Nazareth . ”
43018008	Jesus answered , “ I told you that I am he . So , if you seek me , let these men go . ”
43018009	This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken : “ Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one . ”
43018010	Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear . ( The servant’s name was Malchus .
43018011	So Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword into its sheath ; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me ? ”
43018012	So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him .
43018013	First they led him to Annas , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
43018014	It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people .
43018015	Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple . Since that disciple was known to the high priest , he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest ,
43018016	but Peter stood outside at the door . So the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door , and brought Peter in .
43018017	The servant girl at the door said to Peter , “ You also are not one of this man’s disciples , are you ? ” He said , “ I am not . ”
43018018	Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire , because it was cold , and they were standing and warming themselves . Peter also was with them , standing and warming himself .
43018019	The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered him , “ I have spoken openly to the world . I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple , where all Jews come together . I have said nothing in secret .
43018021	Why do you ask me ? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them ; they know what I said . ”
43018022	When he had said these things , one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand , saying , “ Is that how you answer the high priest ? ”
43018023	Jesus answered him , “ If what I said is wrong , bear witness about the wrong ; but if what I said is right , why do you strike me ? ”
43018024	Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . So they said to him , “ You also are not one of his disciples , are you ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not . ”
43018026	One of the servants of the high priest , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , asked , “ Did I not see you in the garden with him ? ”
43018027	Peter again denied it , and at once a rooster crowed .
43018028	Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor’s headquarters . It was early morning . They themselves did not enter the governor’s headquarters , so that they would not be defiled , but could eat the Passover .
43018029	So Pilate went outside to them and said , “ What accusation do you bring against this man ? ”
43018030	They answered him , “ If this man were not doing evil , we would not have delivered him over to you . ”
43018031	Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law . ” The Jews said to him , “ It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death . ”
43018032	This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die .
43018033	So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him , “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ”
43018034	Jesus answered , “ Do you say this of your own accord , or did others say it to you about me ? ”
43018035	Pilate answered , “ Am I a Jew ? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me . What have you done ? ”
43018036	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , my servants would have been fighting , that I might not be delivered over to the Jews . But my kingdom is not from the world . ”
43018037	Then Pilate said to him , “ So you are a king ? ” Jesus answered , “ You say that I am a king . For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world — to bear witness to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice . ”
43018038	Pilate said to him , “ What is truth ? ” After he had said this , he went back outside to the Jews and told them , “ I find no guilt in him .
43018039	But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover . So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? ”
43018040	They cried out again , “ Not this man , but Barabbas ! ” Now Barabbas was a robber .
43019001	Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him .
43019002	And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe .
43019003	They came up to him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” and struck him with their hands .
43019004	Pilate went out again and said to them , “ See , I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him . ”
43019005	So Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ Behold the man ! ”
43019006	When the chief priests and the officers saw him , they cried out , “ Crucify him , crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and crucify him , for I find no guilt in him . ”
43019007	The Jews answered him , “ We have a law , and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God . ”
43019008	When Pilate heard this statement , he was even more afraid .
43019009	He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus , “ Where are you from ? ” But Jesus gave him no answer .
43019010	So Pilate said to him , “ You will not speak to me ? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you ? ”
43019011	Jesus answered him , “ You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above . Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin . ”
43019012	From then on Pilate sought to release him , but the Jews cried out , “ If you release this man , you are not Caesar’s friend . Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar . ”
43019013	So when Pilate heard these words , he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement , and in Aramaic Gabbatha .
43019014	Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover . It was about the sixth hour . He said to the Jews , “ Behold your King ! ”
43019015	They cried out , “ Away with him , away with him , crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I crucify your King ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We have no king but Caesar . ”
43019016	So he delivered him over to them to be crucified . So they took Jesus ,
43019017	and he went out , bearing his own cross , to the place called The Place of a Skull , which in Aramaic is called Golgotha .
43019018	There they crucified him , and with him two others , one on either side , and Jesus between them .
43019019	Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross . It read , “ Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Jews . ”
43019020	Many of the Jews read this inscription , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and it was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek .
43019021	So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but rather , ‘ This man said , I am King of the Jews . ’ ”
43019022	Pilate answered , “ What I have written I have written . ”
43019023	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus , they took his garments and divided them into four parts , one part for each soldier ; also his tunic . But the tunic was seamless , woven in one piece from top to bottom ,
43019024	so they said to one another , “ Let us not tear it , but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be . ” This was to fulfill the Scripture which says , “ They divided my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots . ” So the soldiers did these things ,
43019025	but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother’s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby , he said to his mother , “ Woman , behold , your son ! ”
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , “ Behold , your mother ! ” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home .
43019028	After this , Jesus , knowing that all was now finished , said ( to fulfill the Scripture ) , “ I thirst . ”
43019029	A jar full of sour wine stood there , so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth .
43019030	When Jesus had received the sour wine , he said , “ It is finished , ” and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
43019031	Since it was the day of Preparation , and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was a high day ) , the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away .
43019032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first , and of the other who had been crucified with him .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and at once there came out blood and water .
43019035	He who saw it has borne witness — his testimony is true , and he knows that he is telling the truth — that you also may believe .
43019036	For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled : “ Not one of his bones will be broken . ”
43019037	And again another Scripture says , “ They will look on him whom they have pierced . ”
43019038	After these things Joseph of Arimathea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus , and Pilate gave him permission . So he came and took away his body .
43019039	Nicodemus also , who earlier had come to Jesus by night , came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about seventy-five pounds in weight .
43019040	So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as is the burial custom of the Jews .
43019041	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid .
43019042	So because of the Jewish day of Preparation , since the tomb was close at hand , they laid Jesus there .
43020001	Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early , while it was still dark , and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb .
43020002	So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one whom Jesus loved , and said to them , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid him . ”
43020003	So Peter went out with the other disciple , and they were going toward the tomb .
43020004	Both of them were running together , but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first .
43020005	And stooping to look in , he saw the linen cloths lying there , but he did not go in .
43020006	Then Simon Peter came , following him , and went into the tomb . He saw the linen cloths lying there ,
43020007	and the face cloth , which had been on Jesus ’ head , not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , also went in , and he saw and believed ;
43020009	for as yet they did not understand the Scripture , that he must rise from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples went back to their homes .
43020011	But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb , and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb .
43020012	And she saw two angels in white , sitting where the body of Jesus had lain , one at the head and one at the feet .
43020013	They said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She said to them , “ They have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid him . ”
43020014	Having said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing , but she did not know that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? ” Supposing him to be the gardener , she said to him , “ Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have laid him , and I will take him away . ”
43020016	Jesus said to her , “ Mary . ” She turned and said to him in Aramaic , “ Rabboni ! ” ( which means Teacher ) .
43020017	Jesus said to her , “ Do not cling to me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father ; but go to my brothers and say to them , ‘ I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ’ ”
43020018	Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord ” — and that he had said these things to her .
43020019	On the evening of that day , the first day of the week , the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood among them and said to them , “ Peace be with you . ”
43020020	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Jesus said to them again , “ Peace be with you . As the Father has sent me , even so I am sending you . ”
43020022	And when he had said this , he breathed on them and said to them , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive the sins of any , they are forgiven them ; if you withhold forgiveness from any , it is withheld . ”
43020024	Now Thomas , one of the Twelve , called the Twin , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	So the other disciples told him , “ We have seen the Lord . ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails , and place my finger into the mark of the nails , and place my hand into his side , I will never believe . ”
43020026	Eight days later , his disciples were inside again , and Thomas was with them . Although the doors were locked , Jesus came and stood among them and said , “ Peace be with you . ”
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and see my hands ; and put out your hand , and place it in my side . Do not disbelieve , but believe . ”
43020028	Thomas answered him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
43020029	Jesus said to him , “ Have you believed because you have seen me ? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed . ”
43020030	Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book ;
43020031	but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that by believing you may have life in his name .
43021001	After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias , and he revealed himself in this way .
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas ( called the Twin ) , Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples were together .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going fishing . ” They said to him , “ We will go with you . ” They went out and got into the boat , but that night they caught nothing .
43021004	Just as day was breaking , Jesus stood on the shore ; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
43021005	Jesus said to them , “ Children , do you have any fish ? ” They answered him , “ No . ”
43021006	He said to them , “ Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some . ” So they cast it , and now they were not able to haul it in , because of the quantity of fish .
43021007	That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he put on his outer garment , for he was stripped for work , and threw himself into the sea .
43021008	The other disciples came in the boat , dragging the net full of fish , for they were not far from the land , but about a hundred yards off .
43021009	When they got out on land , they saw a charcoal fire in place , with fish laid out on it , and bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish that you have just caught . ”
43021011	So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore , full of large fish , 153 of them . And although there were so many , the net was not torn .
43021012	Jesus said to them , “ Come and have breakfast . ” Now none of the disciples dared ask him , “ Who are you ? ” They knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , and so with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead .
43021015	When they had finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you . ” He said to him , “ Feed my lambs . ”
43021016	He said to him a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord ; you know that I love you . ” He said to him , “ Tend my sheep . ”
43021017	He said to him the third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time , “ Do you love me ? ” and he said to him , “ Lord , you know everything ; you know that I love you . ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed my sheep .
43021018	Truly , truly , I say to you , when you were young , you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted , but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go . ”
43021019	( This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God .
43021020	Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them , the one who had been reclining at table close to him and had said , “ Lord , who is it that is going to betray you ? ”
43021021	When Peter saw him , he said to Jesus , “ Lord , what about this man ? ”
43021022	Jesus said to him , “ If it is my will that he remain until I come , what is that to you ? You follow me ! ”
43021023	So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die ; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die , but , “ If it is my will that he remain until I come , what is that to you ? ”
43021024	This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things , and who has written these things , and we know that his testimony is true .
43021025	Now there are also many other things that Jesus did . Were every one of them to be written , I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written .
44001001	In the first book , O Theophilus , I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach ,
44001002	until the day when he was taken up , after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen .
44001003	He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs , appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God .
44001004	And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem , but to wait for the promise of the Father , which , he said , “ you heard from me ;
44001005	for John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now . ”
44001006	So when they had come together , they asked him , “ Lord , will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel ? ”
44001007	He said to them , “ It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority .
44001008	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you , and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria , and to the end of the earth . ”
44001009	And when he had said these things , as they were looking on , he was lifted up , and a cloud took him out of their sight .
44001010	And while they were gazing into heaven as he went , behold , two men stood by them in white robes ,
44001011	and said , “ Men of Galilee , why do you stand looking into heaven ? This Jesus , who was taken up from you into heaven , will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven . ”
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day’s journey away .
44001013	And when they had entered , they went up to the upper room , where they were staying , Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James .
44001014	All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer , together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus , and his brothers .
44001015	In those days Peter stood up among the brothers ( the company of persons was in all about 120
44001016	“ Brothers , the Scripture had to be fulfilled , which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas , who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus .
44001017	For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry . ”
44001018	( Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness , and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out .
44001019	And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama , that is , Field of Blood .
44001020	“ For it is written in the Book of Psalms , “ ‘ May his camp become desolate , and let there be no one to dwell in it ’ ; and “ ‘ Let another take his office . ’
44001021	So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
44001022	beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us — one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection . ”
44001023	And they put forward two , Joseph called Barsabbas , who was also called Justus , and Matthias .
44001024	And they prayed and said , “ You , Lord , who know the hearts of all , show which one of these two you have chosen
44001025	to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place . ”
44001026	And they cast lots for them , and the lot fell on Matthias , and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
44002001	When the day of Pentecost arrived , they were all together in one place .
44002002	And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind , and it filled the entire house where they were sitting .
44002003	And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them .
44002004	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance .
44002005	Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews , devout men from every nation under heaven .
44002006	And at this sound the multitude came together , and they were bewildered , because each one was hearing them speak in his own language .
44002007	And they were amazed and astonished , saying , “ Are not all these who are speaking Galileans ?
44002008	And how is it that we hear , each of us in his own native language ?
44002009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene , and visitors from Rome ,
44002011	both Jews and proselytes , Cretans and Arabians — we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God . ”
44002012	And all were amazed and perplexed , saying to one another , “ What does this mean ? ”
44002013	But others mocking said , “ They are filled with new wine . ”
44002014	But Peter , standing with the eleven , lifted up his voice and addressed them : “ Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and give ear to my words .
44002015	For these people are not drunk , as you suppose , since it is only the third hour of the day .
44002016	But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel :
44002017	“ ‘ And in the last days it shall be , God declares , that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh , and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams ;
44002018	even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit , and they shall prophesy .
44002019	And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below , blood , and fire , and vapor of smoke ;
44002020	the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood , before the day of the Lord comes , the great and magnificent day .
44002021	And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved . ’
44002022	“ Men of Israel , hear these words : Jesus of Nazareth , a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst , as you yourselves know —
44002023	this Jesus , delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God , you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men .
44002024	God raised him up , loosing the pangs of death , because it was not possible for him to be held by it .
44002025	For David says concerning him , “ ‘ I saw the Lord always before me , for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken ;
44002026	therefore my heart was glad , and my tongue rejoiced ; my flesh also will dwell in hope .
44002027	For you will not abandon my soul to Hades , or let your Holy One see corruption .
44002028	You have made known to me the paths of life ; you will make me full of gladness with your presence . ’
44002029	“ Brothers , I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
44002030	Being therefore a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne ,
44002031	he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ , that he was not abandoned to Hades , nor did his flesh see corruption .
44002032	This Jesus God raised up , and of that we all are witnesses .
44002033	Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing .
44002034	For David did not ascend into the heavens , but he himself says , “ ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand ,
44002035	until I make your enemies your footstool . ’
44002036	Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you crucified . ”
44002037	Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart , and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles , “ Brothers , what shall we do ? ”
44002038	And Peter said to them , “ Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off , everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself . ”
44002040	And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them , saying , “ Save yourselves from this crooked generation . ”
44002041	So those who received his word were baptized , and there were added that day about three thousand souls .
44002042	And they devoted themselves to the apostles ’ teaching and the fellowship , to the breaking of bread and the prayers .
44002043	And awe came upon every soul , and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles .
44002044	And all who believed were together and had all things in common .
44002045	And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all , as any had need .
44002046	And day by day , attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes , they received their food with glad and generous hearts ,
44002047	praising God and having favor with all the people . And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved .
44003001	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer , the ninth hour .
44003002	And a man lame from birth was being carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple .
44003003	Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple , he asked to receive alms .
44003004	And Peter directed his gaze at him , as did John , and said , “ Look at us . ”
44003005	And he fixed his attention on them , expecting to receive something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , “ I have no silver and gold , but what I do have I give to you . In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , rise up and walk ! ”
44003007	And he took him by the right hand and raised him up , and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong .
44003008	And leaping up he stood and began to walk , and entered the temple with them , walking and leaping and praising God .
44003009	And all the people saw him walking and praising God ,
44003010	and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple , asking for alms . And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
44003011	While he clung to Peter and John , all the people , utterly astounded , ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s .
44003012	And when Peter saw it he addressed the people : “ Men of Israel , why do you wonder at this , or why do you stare at us , as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , the God of our fathers , glorified his servant Jesus , whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate , when he had decided to release him .
44003014	But you denied the Holy and Righteous One , and asked for a murderer to be granted to you ,
44003015	and you killed the Author of life , whom God raised from the dead . To this we are witnesses .
44003016	And his name — by faith in his name — has made this man strong whom you see and know , and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all .
44003017	“ And now , brothers , I know that you acted in ignorance , as did also your rulers .
44003018	But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets , that his Christ would suffer , he thus fulfilled .
44003019	Repent therefore , and turn again , that your sins may be blotted out ,
44003020	that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord , and that he may send the Christ appointed for you , Jesus ,
44003021	whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago .
44003022	Moses said , ‘ The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers . You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you .
44003023	And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people . ’
44003024	And all the prophets who have spoken , from Samuel and those who came after him , also proclaimed these days .
44003025	You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers , saying to Abraham , ‘ And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed . ’
44003026	God , having raised up his servant , sent him to you first , to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness . ”
44004001	And as they were speaking to the people , the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them ,
44004002	greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44004003	And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day , for it was already evening .
44004004	But many of those who had heard the word believed , and the number of the men came to about five thousand .
44004005	On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem ,
44004006	with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander , and all who were of the high-priestly family .
44004007	And when they had set them in the midst , they inquired , “ By what power or by what name did you do this ? ”
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , said to them , “ Rulers of the people and elders ,
44004009	if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man , by what means this man has been healed ,
44004010	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead — by him this man is standing before you well .
44004011	This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you , the builders , which has become the cornerstone .
44004012	And there is salvation in no one else , for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved . ”
44004013	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were uneducated , common men , they were astonished . And they recognized that they had been with Jesus .
44004014	But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them , they had nothing to say in opposition .
44004015	But when they had commanded them to leave the council , they conferred with one another ,
44004016	saying , “ What shall we do with these men ? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But in order that it may spread no further among the people , let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name . ”
44004018	So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John answered them , “ Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , you must judge ,
44004020	for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard . ”
44004021	And when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people , for all were praising God for what had happened .
44004022	For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old .
44004023	When they were released , they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them .
44004024	And when they heard it , they lifted their voices together to God and said , “ Sovereign Lord , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them ,
44004025	who through the mouth of our father David , your servant , said by the Holy Spirit , “ ‘ Why did the Gentiles rage , and the peoples plot in vain ?
44004026	The kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers were gathered together , against the Lord and against his Anointed ’ —
44004027	for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus , whom you anointed , both Herod and Pontius Pilate , along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel ,
44004028	to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place .
44004029	And now , Lord , look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness ,
44004030	while you stretch out your hand to heal , and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus . ”
44004031	And when they had prayed , the place in which they were gathered together was shaken , and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness .
44004032	Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul , and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own , but they had everything in common .
44004033	And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and great grace was upon them all .
44004034	There was not a needy person among them , for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold
44004035	and laid it at the apostles ’ feet , and it was distributed to each as any had need .
44004036	Thus Joseph , who was also called by the apostles Barnabas ( which means son of encouragement ) , a Levite , a native of Cyprus ,
44004037	sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles ’ feet .
44005001	But a man named Ananias , with his wife Sapphira , sold a piece of property ,
44005002	and with his wife’s knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles ’ feet .
44005003	But Peter said , “ Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land ?
44005004	While it remained unsold , did it not remain your own ? And after it was sold , was it not at your disposal ? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart ? You have not lied to men but to God . ”
44005005	When Ananias heard these words , he fell down and breathed his last . And great fear came upon all who heard of it .
44005006	The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him .
44005007	After an interval of about three hours his wife came in , not knowing what had happened .
44005008	And Peter said to her , “ Tell me whether you sold the land for so much . ” And she said , “ Yes , for so much . ”
44005009	But Peter said to her , “ How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Behold , the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out . ”
44005010	Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last . When the young men came in they found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things .
44005012	Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles . And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico .
44005013	None of the rest dared join them , but the people held them in high esteem .
44005014	And more than ever believers were added to the Lord , multitudes of both men and women ,
44005015	so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats , that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them .
44005016	The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem , bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits , and they were all healed .
44005017	But the high priest rose up , and all who were with him ( that is , the party of the Sadducees ) , and filled with jealousy
44005018	they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison .
44005019	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out , and said ,
44005020	“ Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life . ”
44005021	And when they heard this , they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach . Now when the high priest came , and those who were with him , they called together the council and all the senate of the people of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought .
44005022	But when the officers came , they did not find them in the prison , so they returned and reported ,
44005023	“ We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors , but when we opened them we found no one inside . ”
44005024	Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words , they were greatly perplexed about them , wondering what this would come to .
44005025	And someone came and told them , “ Look ! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people . ”
44005026	Then the captain with the officers went and brought them , but not by force , for they were afraid of being stoned by the people .
44005027	And when they had brought them , they set them before the council . And the high priest questioned them ,
44005028	saying , “ We strictly charged you not to teach in this name , yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us . ”
44005029	But Peter and the apostles answered , “ We must obey God rather than men .
44005030	The God of our fathers raised Jesus , whom you killed by hanging him on a tree .
44005031	God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior , to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins .
44005032	And we are witnesses to these things , and so is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who obey him . ”
44005033	When they heard this , they were enraged and wanted to kill them .
44005034	But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel , a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people , stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while .
44005035	And he said to them , “ Men of Israel , take care what you are about to do with these men .
44005036	For before these days Theudas rose up , claiming to be somebody , and a number of men , about four hundred , joined him . He was killed , and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing .
44005037	After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him . He too perished , and all who followed him were scattered .
44005038	So in the present case I tell you , keep away from these men and let them alone , for if this plan or this undertaking is of man , it will fail ;
44005039	but if it is of God , you will not be able to overthrow them . You might even be found opposing God ! ” So they took his advice ,
44005040	and when they had called in the apostles , they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
44005041	Then they left the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name .
44005042	And every day , in the temple and from house to house , they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ .
44006001	Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number , a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution .
44006002	And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said , “ It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables .
44006003	Therefore , brothers , pick out from among you seven men of good repute , full of the Spirit and of wisdom , whom we will appoint to this duty .
44006004	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word . ”
44006005	And what they said pleased the whole gathering , and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Parmenas , and Nicolaus , a proselyte of Antioch .
44006006	These they set before the apostles , and they prayed and laid their hands on them .
44006007	And the word of God continued to increase , and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem , and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith .
44006008	And Stephen , full of grace and power , was doing great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen ( as it was called ) , and of the Cyrenians , and of the Alexandrians , and of those from Cilicia and Asia , rose up and disputed with Stephen .
44006010	But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking .
44006011	Then they secretly instigated men who said , “ We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God . ”
44006012	And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes , and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council ,
44006013	and they set up false witnesses who said , “ This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law ,
44006014	for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us . ”
44006015	And gazing at him , all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	And the high priest said , “ Are these things so ? ”
44007002	And Stephen said : “ Brothers and fathers , hear me . The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran ,
44007003	and said to him , ‘ Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you . ’
44007004	Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran . And after his father died , God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living .
44007005	Yet he gave him no inheritance in it , not even a foot’s length , but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him , though he had no child .
44007006	And God spoke to this effect — that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others , who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years .
44007007	‘ But I will judge the nation that they serve , ’ said God , ‘ and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place . ’
44007008	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision . And so Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circumcised him on the eighth day , and Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	“ And the patriarchs , jealous of Joseph , sold him into Egypt ; but God was with him
44007010	and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household .
44007011	Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan , and great affliction , and our fathers could find no food .
44007012	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent out our fathers on their first visit .
44007013	And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers , and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh .
44007014	And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred , seventy-five persons in all .
44007015	And Jacob went down into Egypt , and he died , he and our fathers ,
44007016	and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	“ But as the time of the promise drew near , which God had granted to Abraham , the people increased and multiplied in Egypt
44007018	until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph .
44007019	He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants , so that they would not be kept alive .
44007020	At this time Moses was born ; and he was beautiful in God’s sight . And he was brought up for three months in his father’s house ,
44007021	and when he was exposed , Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son .
44007022	And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and he was mighty in his words and deeds .
44007023	“ When he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brothers , the children of Israel .
44007024	And seeing one of them being wronged , he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian .
44007025	He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand , but they did not understand .
44007026	And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them , saying , ‘ Men , you are brothers . Why do you wrong each other ? ’
44007027	But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
44007028	Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? ’
44007029	At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
44007030	“ Now when forty years had passed , an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai , in a flame of fire in a bush .
44007031	When Moses saw it , he was amazed at the sight , and as he drew near to look , there came the voice of the Lord :
44007032	‘ I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob . ’ And Moses trembled and did not dare to look .
44007033	Then the Lord said to him , ‘ Take off the sandals from your feet , for the place where you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and have heard their groaning , and I have come down to deliver them . And now come , I will send you to Egypt . ’
44007035	“ This Moses , whom they rejected , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ’ — this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them out , performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years .
44007037	This is the Moses who said to the Israelites , ‘ God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers . ’
44007038	This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai , and with our fathers . He received living oracles to give to us .
44007039	Our fathers refused to obey him , but thrust him aside , and in their hearts they turned to Egypt ,
44007040	saying to Aaron , ‘ Make for us gods who will go before us . As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt , we do not know what has become of him . ’
44007041	And they made a calf in those days , and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands .
44007042	But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven , as it is written in the book of the prophets : “ ‘ Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices , during the forty years in the wilderness , O house of Israel ?
44007043	You took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan , the images that you made to worship ; and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon . ’
44007044	“ Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness , just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it , according to the pattern that he had seen .
44007045	Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers . So it was until the days of David ,
44007046	who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But it was Solomon who built a house for him .
44007048	Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands , as the prophet says ,
44007049	“ ‘ Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool . What kind of house will you build for me , says the Lord , or what is the place of my rest ?
44007050	Did not my hand make all these things ? ’
44007051	“ You stiff-necked people , uncircumcised in heart and ears , you always resist the Holy Spirit . As your fathers did , so do you .
44007052	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute ? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One , whom you have now betrayed and murdered ,
44007053	you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it . ”
44007054	Now when they heard these things they were enraged , and they ground their teeth at him .
44007055	But he , full of the Holy Spirit , gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing at the right hand of God .
44007056	And he said , “ Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God . ”
44007057	But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together at him .
44007058	Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him . And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	And as they were stoning Stephen , he called out , “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . ”
44007060	And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice , “ Lord , do not hold this sin against them . ” And when he had said this , he fell asleep .
44008001	And Saul approved of his execution . And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem , and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except the apostles .
44008002	Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him .
44008003	But Saul was ravaging the church , and entering house after house , he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison .
44008004	Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word .
44008005	Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ .
44008006	And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did .
44008007	For unclean spirits , crying out with a loud voice , came out of many who had them , and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed .
44008008	So there was much joy in that city .
44008009	But there was a man named Simon , who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria , saying that he himself was somebody great .
44008010	They all paid attention to him , from the least to the greatest , saying , “ This man is the power of God that is called Great . ”
44008011	And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic .
44008012	But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
44008013	Even Simon himself believed , and after being baptized he continued with Philip . And seeing signs and great miracles performed , he was amazed .
44008014	Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent to them Peter and John ,
44008015	who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit ,
44008016	for he had not yet fallen on any of them , but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles ’ hands , he offered them money ,
44008019	saying , “ Give me this power also , so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit . ”
44008020	But Peter said to him , “ May your silver perish with you , because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money !
44008021	You have neither part nor lot in this matter , for your heart is not right before God .
44008022	Repent , therefore , of this wickedness of yours , and pray to the Lord that , if possible , the intent of your heart may be forgiven you .
44008023	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity . ”
44008024	And Simon answered , “ Pray for me to the Lord , that nothing of what you have said may come upon me . ”
44008025	Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , they returned to Jerusalem , preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans .
44008026	Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip , “ Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . ” This is a desert place .
44008027	And he rose and went . And there was an Ethiopian , a eunuch , a court official of Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was in charge of all her treasure . He had come to Jerusalem to worship
44008028	and was returning , seated in his chariot , and he was reading the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	And the Spirit said to Philip , “ Go over and join this chariot . ”
44008030	So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked , “ Do you understand what you are reading ? ”
44008031	And he said , “ How can I , unless someone guides me ? ” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him .
44008032	Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this : “ Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent , so he opens not his mouth .
44008033	In his humiliation justice was denied him . Who can describe his generation ? For his life is taken away from the earth . ”
44008034	And the eunuch said to Philip , “ About whom , I ask you , does the prophet say this , about himself or about someone else ? ”
44008035	Then Philip opened his mouth , and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus .
44008036	And as they were going along the road they came to some water , and the eunuch said , “ See , here is water ! What prevents me from being baptized ? ”
44008038	And he commanded the chariot to stop , and they both went down into the water , Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
44008039	And when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away , and the eunuch saw him no more , and went on his way rejoicing .
44008040	But Philip found himself at Azotus , and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea .
44009001	But Saul , still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest
44009002	and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus , so that if he found any belonging to the Way , men or women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
44009003	Now as he went on his way , he approached Damascus , and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him .
44009004	And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ”
44009005	And he said , “ Who are you , Lord ? ” And he said , “ I am Jesus , whom you are persecuting .
44009006	But rise and enter the city , and you will be told what you are to do . ”
44009007	The men who were traveling with him stood speechless , hearing the voice but seeing no one .
44009008	Saul rose from the ground , and although his eyes were opened , he saw nothing . So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus .
44009009	And for three days he was without sight , and neither ate nor drank .
44009010	Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias . The Lord said to him in a vision , “ Ananias . ” And he said , “ Here I am , Lord . ”
44009011	And the Lord said to him , “ Rise and go to the street called Straight , and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul , for behold , he is praying ,
44009012	and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight . ”
44009013	But Ananias answered , “ Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem .
44009014	And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name . ”
44009015	But the Lord said to him , “ Go , for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel .
44009016	For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name . ”
44009017	So Ananias departed and entered the house . And laying his hands on him he said , “ Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44009018	And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes , and he regained his sight . Then he rose and was baptized ;
44009019	and taking food , he was strengthened . For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus .
44009020	And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues , saying , “ He is the Son of God . ”
44009021	And all who heard him were amazed and said , “ Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name ? And has he not come here for this purpose , to bring them bound before the chief priests ? ”
44009022	But Saul increased all the more in strength , and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ .
44009023	When many days had passed , the Jews plotted to kill him ,
44009024	but their plot became known to Saul . They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him ,
44009025	but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	And when he had come to Jerusalem , he attempted to join the disciples . And they were all afraid of him , for they did not believe that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord , who spoke to him , and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus .
44009028	So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem , preaching boldly in the name of the Lord .
44009029	And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists . But they were seeking to kill him .
44009030	And when the brothers learned this , they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus .
44009031	So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up . And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit , it multiplied .
44009032	Now as Peter went here and there among them all , he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
44009033	There he found a man named Aeneas , bedridden for eight years , who was paralyzed .
44009034	And Peter said to him , “ Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you ; rise and make your bed . ” And immediately he rose .
44009035	And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha , which , translated , means Dorcas . She was full of good works and acts of charity .
44009037	In those days she became ill and died , and when they had washed her , they laid her in an upper room .
44009038	Since Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples , hearing that Peter was there , sent two men to him , urging him , “ Please come to us without delay . ”
44009039	So Peter rose and went with them . And when he arrived , they took him to the upper room . All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them .
44009040	But Peter put them all outside , and knelt down and prayed ; and turning to the body he said , “ Tabitha , arise . ” And she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter she sat up .
44009041	And he gave her his hand and raised her up . Then calling the saints and widows , he presented her alive .
44009042	And it became known throughout all Joppa , and many believed in the Lord .
44009043	And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon , a tanner .
44010001	At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort ,
44010002	a devout man who feared God with all his household , gave alms generously to the people , and prayed continually to God .
44010003	About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him , “ Cornelius . ”
44010004	And he stared at him in terror and said , “ What is it , Lord ? ” And he said to him , “ Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God .
44010005	And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter .
44010006	He is lodging with one Simon , a tanner , whose house is by the sea . ”
44010007	When the angel who spoke to him had departed , he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him ,
44010008	and having related everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	The next day , as they were on their journey and approaching the city , Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray .
44010010	And he became hungry and wanted something to eat , but while they were preparing it , he fell into a trance
44010011	and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending , being let down by its four corners upon the earth .
44010012	In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air .
44010013	And there came a voice to him : “ Rise , Peter ; kill and eat . ”
44010014	But Peter said , “ By no means , Lord ; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean . ”
44010015	And the voice came to him again a second time , “ What God has made clean , do not call common . ”
44010016	This happened three times , and the thing was taken up at once to heaven .
44010017	Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made inquiry for Simon’s house , stood at the gate
44010018	and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there .
44010019	And while Peter was pondering the vision , the Spirit said to him , “ Behold , three men are looking for you .
44010020	Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation , for I have sent them . ”
44010021	And Peter went down to the men and said , “ I am the one you are looking for . What is the reason for your coming ? ”
44010022	And they said , “ Cornelius , a centurion , an upright and God-fearing man , who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation , was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say . ”
44010023	So he invited them in to be his guests . The next day he rose and went away with them , and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	And on the following day they entered Caesarea . Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends .
44010025	When Peter entered , Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him .
44010026	But Peter lifted him up , saying , “ Stand up ; I too am a man . ”
44010027	And as he talked with him , he went in and found many persons gathered .
44010028	And he said to them , “ You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation , but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean .
44010029	So when I was sent for , I came without objection . I ask then why you sent for me . ”
44010030	And Cornelius said , “ Four days ago , about this hour , I was praying in my house at the ninth hour , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing
44010031	and said , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God .
44010032	Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter . He is lodging in the house of Simon , a tanner , by the sea . ’
44010033	So I sent for you at once , and you have been kind enough to come . Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord . ”
44010034	So Peter opened his mouth and said : “ Truly I understand that God shows no partiality ,
44010035	but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him .
44010036	As for the word that he sent to Israel , preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ ( he is Lord of all ) ,
44010037	you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed :
44010038	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power . He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him .
44010039	And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem . They put him to death by hanging him on a tree ,
44010040	but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear ,
44010041	not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
44010042	And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . ”
44010044	While Peter was still saying these things , the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word .
44010045	And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed , because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles .
44010046	For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God . Then Peter declared ,
44010047	“ Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people , who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have ? ”
44010048	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to remain for some days .
44011001	Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God .
44011002	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem , the circumcision party criticized him , saying ,
44011003	“ You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them . ”
44011004	But Peter began and explained it to them in order :
44011005	“ I was in the city of Joppa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision , something like a great sheet descending , being let down from heaven by its four corners , and it came down to me .
44011006	Looking at it closely , I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air .
44011007	And I heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Rise , Peter ; kill and eat . ’
44011008	But I said , ‘ By no means , Lord ; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth . ’
44011009	But the voice answered a second time from heaven , ‘ What God has made clean , do not call common . ’
44011010	This happened three times , and all was drawn up again into heaven .
44011011	And behold , at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were , sent to me from Caesarea .
44011012	And the Spirit told me to go with them , making no distinction . These six brothers also accompanied me , and we entered the man’s house .
44011013	And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say , ‘ Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter ;
44011014	he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved , you and all your household . ’
44011015	As I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning .
44011016	And I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ‘ John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
44011017	If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I that I could stand in God’s way ? ”
44011018	When they heard these things they fell silent . And they glorified God , saying , “ Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life . ”
44011019	Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch , speaking the word to no one except Jews .
44011020	But there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also , preaching the Lord Jesus .
44011021	And the hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number who believed turned to the Lord .
44011022	The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem , and they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he came and saw the grace of God , he was glad , and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose ,
44011024	for he was a good man , full of the Holy Spirit and of faith . And a great many people were added to the Lord .
44011025	So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul ,
44011026	and when he had found him , he brought him to Antioch . For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people . And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians .
44011027	Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world ( this took place in the days of Claudius ) .
44011029	So the disciples determined , everyone according to his ability , to send relief to the brothers living in Judea .
44011030	And they did so , sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church .
44012002	He killed James the brother of John with the sword ,
44012003	and when he saw that it pleased the Jews , he proceeded to arrest Peter also . This was during the days of Unleavened Bread .
44012004	And when he had seized him , he put him in prison , delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him , intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison , but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church .
44012006	Now when Herod was about to bring him out , on that very night , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains , and sentries before the door were guarding the prison .
44012007	And behold , an angel of the Lord stood next to him , and a light shone in the cell . He struck Peter on the side and woke him , saying , “ Get up quickly . ” And the chains fell off his hands .
44012008	And the angel said to him , “ Dress yourself and put on your sandals . ” And he did so . And he said to him , “ Wrap your cloak around you and follow me . ”
44012009	And he went out and followed him . He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	When they had passed the first and the second guard , they came to the iron gate leading into the city . It opened for them of its own accord , and they went out and went along one street , and immediately the angel left him .
44012011	When Peter came to himself , he said , “ Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting . ”
44012012	When he realized this , he went to the house of Mary , the mother of John whose other name was Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
44012013	And when he knocked at the door of the gateway , a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer .
44012014	Recognizing Peter’s voice , in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate .
44012015	They said to her , “ You are out of your mind . ” But she kept insisting that it was so , and they kept saying , “ It is his angel ! ”
44012016	But Peter continued knocking , and when they opened , they saw him and were amazed .
44012017	But motioning to them with his hand to be silent , he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . And he said , “ Tell these things to James and to the brothers . ” Then he departed and went to another place .
44012018	Now when day came , there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter .
44012019	And after Herod searched for him and did not find him , he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death . Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there .
44012020	Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon , and they came to him with one accord , and having persuaded Blastus , the king’s chamberlain , they asked for peace , because their country depended on the king’s country for food .
44012021	On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes , took his seat upon the throne , and delivered an oration to them .
44012022	And the people were shouting , “ The voice of a god , and not of a man ! ”
44012023	Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down , because he did not give God the glory , and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last .
44012024	But the word of God increased and multiplied .
44012025	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service , bringing with them John , whose other name was Mark .
44013001	Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers , Barnabas , Simeon who was called Niger , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
44013002	While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , “ Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them . ”
44013003	Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off .
44013004	So , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia , and from there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	When they arrived at Salamis , they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews . And they had John to assist them .
44013006	When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos , they came upon a certain magician , a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus .
44013007	He was with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , a man of intelligence , who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God .
44013008	But Elymas the magician ( for that is the meaning of his name
44013009	But Saul , who was also called Paul , filled with the Holy Spirit , looked intently at him
44013010	and said , “ You son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness , full of all deceit and villainy , will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord ?
44013011	And now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon you , and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time . ” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him , and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then the proconsul believed , when he saw what had occurred , for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord .
44013013	Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia . And John left them and returned to Jerusalem ,
44013014	but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia . And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	After the reading from the Law and the Prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them , saying , “ Brothers , if you have any word of encouragement for the people , say it . ”
44013016	So Paul stood up , and motioning with his hand said : “ Men of Israel and you who fear God , listen .
44013017	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt , and with uplifted arm he led them out of it .
44013018	And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness .
44013019	And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave them their land as an inheritance .
44013020	All this took about 450 years . And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet .
44013021	Then they asked for a king , and God gave them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44013022	And when he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king , of whom he testified and said , ‘ I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart , who will do all my will . ’
44013023	Of this man’s offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior , Jesus , as he promised .
44013024	Before his coming , John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	And as John was finishing his course , he said , ‘ What do you suppose that I am ? I am not he . No , but behold , after me one is coming , the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie . ’
44013026	“ Brothers , sons of the family of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , to us has been sent the message of this salvation .
44013027	For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers , because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets , which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
44013028	And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death , they asked Pilate to have him executed .
44013029	And when they had carried out all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from the dead ,
44013031	and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are now his witnesses to the people .
44013032	And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers ,
44013033	this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus , as also it is written in the second Psalm , “ ‘ You are my Son , today I have begotten you . ’
44013034	And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead , no more to return to corruption , he has spoken in this way , “ ‘ I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . ’
44013035	Therefore he says also in another psalm , “ ‘ You will not let your Holy One see corruption . ’
44013036	For David , after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation , fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption ,
44013037	but he whom God raised up did not see corruption .
44013038	Let it be known to you therefore , brothers , that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you ,
44013039	and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses .
44013040	Beware , therefore , lest what is said in the Prophets should come about :
44013041	“ ‘ Look , you scoffers , be astounded and perish ; for I am doing a work in your days , a work that you will not believe , even if one tells it to you . ’ ”
44013042	As they went out , the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath .
44013043	And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up , many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas , who , as they spoke with them , urged them to continue in the grace of God .
44013044	The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord .
44013045	But when the Jews saw the crowds , they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul , reviling him .
44013046	And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly , saying , “ It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you . Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life , behold , we are turning to the Gentiles .
44013047	For so the Lord has commanded us , saying , “ ‘ I have made you a light for the Gentiles , that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth . ’ ”
44013048	And when the Gentiles heard this , they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord , and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
44013049	And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region .
44013050	But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city , stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and drove them out of their district .
44013051	But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium .
44013052	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed .
44014002	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers .
44014003	So they remained for a long time , speaking boldly for the Lord , who bore witness to the word of his grace , granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
44014004	But the people of the city were divided ; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles .
44014005	When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews , with their rulers , to mistreat them and to stone them ,
44014006	they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and to the surrounding country ,
44014007	and there they continued to preach the gospel .
44014008	Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet . He was crippled from birth and had never walked .
44014009	He listened to Paul speaking . And Paul , looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well ,
44014010	said in a loud voice , “ Stand upright on your feet . ” And he sprang up and began walking .
44014011	And when the crowds saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in Lycaonian , “ The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men ! ”
44014012	Barnabas they called Zeus , and Paul , Hermes , because he was the chief speaker .
44014013	And the priest of Zeus , whose temple was at the entrance to the city , brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds .
44014014	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it , they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd , crying out ,
44014015	“ Men , why are you doing these things ? We also are men , of like nature with you , and we bring you good news , that you should turn from these vain things to a living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them .
44014016	In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways .
44014017	Yet he did not leave himself without witness , for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons , satisfying your hearts with food and gladness . ”
44014018	Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them .
44014019	But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium , and having persuaded the crowds , they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city , supposing that he was dead .
44014020	But when the disciples gathered about him , he rose up and entered the city , and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe .
44014021	When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples , they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch ,
44014022	strengthening the souls of the disciples , encouraging them to continue in the faith , and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God .
44014023	And when they had appointed elders for them in every church , with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed .
44014024	Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia .
44014025	And when they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia ,
44014026	and from there they sailed to Antioch , where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled .
44014027	And when they arrived and gathered the church together , they declared all that God had done with them , and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	And they remained no little time with the disciples .
44015001	But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers , “ Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved . ”
44015002	And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them , Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question .
44015003	So , being sent on their way by the church , they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles , and brought great joy to all the brothers .
44015004	When they came to Jerusalem , they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders , and they declared all that God had done with them .
44015005	But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said , “ It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses . ”
44015006	The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter .
44015007	And after there had been much debate , Peter stood up and said to them , “ Brothers , you know that in the early days God made a choice among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe .
44015008	And God , who knows the heart , bore witness to them , by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us ,
44015009	and he made no distinction between us and them , having cleansed their hearts by faith .
44015010	Now , therefore , why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear ?
44015011	But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , just as they will . ”
44015012	And all the assembly fell silent , and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles .
44015013	After they finished speaking , James replied , “ Brothers , listen to me .
44015014	Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles , to take from them a people for his name .
44015015	And with this the words of the prophets agree , just as it is written ,
44015016	“ ‘ After this I will return , and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen ; I will rebuild its ruins , and I will restore it ,
44015017	that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord , and all the Gentiles who are called by my name , says the Lord , who makes these things
44015018	known from of old . ’
44015019	Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God ,
44015020	but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols , and from sexual immorality , and from what has been strangled , and from blood .
44015021	For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him , for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues . ”
44015022	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders , with the whole church , to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . They sent Judas called Barsabbas , and Silas , leading men among the brothers ,
44015023	with the following letter : “ The brothers , both the apostles and the elders , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia , greetings .
44015024	Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words , unsettling your minds , although we gave them no instructions ,
44015025	it has seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44015026	men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	We have therefore sent Judas and Silas , who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth .
44015028	For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements :
44015029	that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols , and from blood , and from what has been strangled , and from sexual immorality . If you keep yourselves from these , you will do well . Farewell . ”
44015030	So when they were sent off , they went down to Antioch , and having gathered the congregation together , they delivered the letter .
44015031	And when they had read it , they rejoiced because of its encouragement .
44015032	And Judas and Silas , who were themselves prophets , encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words .
44015033	And after they had spent some time , they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them .
44015035	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
44015036	And after some days Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord , and see how they are . ”
44015037	Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark .
44015038	But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work .
44015039	And there arose a sharp disagreement , so that they separated from each other . Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus ,
44015040	but Paul chose Silas and departed , having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord .
44015041	And he went through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches .
44016001	Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra . A disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer , but his father was a Greek .
44016002	He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium .
44016003	Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him , and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places , for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
44016004	As they went on their way through the cities , they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem .
44016005	So the churches were strengthened in the faith , and they increased in numbers daily .
44016006	And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
44016007	And when they had come up to Mysia , they attempted to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them .
44016008	So , passing by Mysia , they went down to Troas .
44016009	And a vision appeared to Paul in the night : a man of Macedonia was standing there , urging him and saying , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us . ”
44016010	And when Paul had seen the vision , immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia , concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them .
44016011	So , setting sail from Troas , we made a direct voyage to Samothrace , and the following day to Neapolis ,
44016012	and from there to Philippi , which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony . We remained in this city some days .
44016013	And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together .
44016014	One who heard us was a woman named Lydia , from the city of Thyatira , a seller of purple goods , who was a worshiper of God . The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul .
44016015	And after she was baptized , and her household as well , she urged us , saying , “ If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come to my house and stay . ” And she prevailed upon us .
44016016	As we were going to the place of prayer , we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling .
44016017	She followed Paul and us , crying out , “ These men are servants of the Most High God , who proclaim to you the way of salvation . ”
44016018	And this she kept doing for many days . Paul , having become greatly annoyed , turned and said to the spirit , “ I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her . ” And it came out that very hour .
44016019	But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone , they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
44016020	And when they had brought them to the magistrates , they said , “ These men are Jews , and they are disturbing our city .
44016021	They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice . ”
44016022	The crowd joined in attacking them , and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods .
44016023	And when they had inflicted many blows upon them , they threw them into prison , ordering the jailer to keep them safely .
44016024	Having received this order , he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks .
44016025	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them ,
44016026	and suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken . And immediately all the doors were opened , and everyone’s bonds were unfastened .
44016027	When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open , he drew his sword and was about to kill himself , supposing that the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul cried with a loud voice , “ Do not harm yourself , for we are all here . ”
44016029	And the jailer called for lights and rushed in , and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas .
44016030	Then he brought them out and said , “ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44016031	And they said , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved , you and your household . ”
44016032	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house .
44016033	And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds ; and he was baptized at once , he and all his family .
44016034	Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them . And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God .
44016035	But when it was day , the magistrates sent the police , saying , “ Let those men go . ”
44016036	And the jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , “ The magistrates have sent to let you go . Therefore come out now and go in peace . ”
44016037	But Paul said to them , “ They have beaten us publicly , uncondemned , men who are Roman citizens , and have thrown us into prison ; and do they now throw us out secretly ? No ! Let them come themselves and take us out . ”
44016038	The police reported these words to the magistrates , and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens .
44016039	So they came and apologized to them . And they took them out and asked them to leave the city .
44016040	So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia . And when they had seen the brothers , they encouraged them and departed .
44017001	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a synagogue of the Jews .
44017002	And Paul went in , as was his custom , and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
44017003	explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead , and saying , “ This Jesus , whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ . ”
44017004	And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas , as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women .
44017005	But the Jews were jealous , and taking some wicked men of the rabble , they formed a mob , set the city in an uproar , and attacked the house of Jason , seeking to bring them out to the crowd .
44017006	And when they could not find them , they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities , shouting , “ These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also ,
44017007	and Jason has received them , and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus . ”
44017008	And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things .
44017009	And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest , they let them go .
44017010	The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea , and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica ; they received the word with all eagerness , examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so .
44017012	Many of them therefore believed , with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men .
44017013	But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also , they came there too , agitating and stirring up the crowds .
44017014	Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea , but Silas and Timothy remained there .
44017015	Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens , and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible , they departed .
44017016	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols .
44017017	So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons , and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there .
44017018	Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him . And some said , “ What does this babbler wish to say ? ” Others said , “ He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities ” — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , “ May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting ?
44017020	For you bring some strange things to our ears . We wish to know therefore what these things mean . ”
44017021	Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new .
44017022	So Paul , standing in the midst of the Areopagus , said : “ Men of Athens , I perceive that in every way you are very religious .
44017023	For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an altar with this inscription , ‘ To the unknown god . ’ What therefore you worship as unknown , this I proclaim to you .
44017024	The God who made the world and everything in it , being Lord of heaven and earth , does not live in temples made by man ,
44017025	nor is he served by human hands , as though he needed anything , since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything .
44017026	And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth , having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place ,
44017027	that they should seek God , in the hope that they might feel their way toward him and find him . Yet he is actually not far from each one of us ,
44017028	for “ ‘ In him we live and move and have our being ’ ; as even some of your own poets have said , “ ‘ For we are indeed his offspring . ’
44017029	Being then God’s offspring , we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone , an image formed by the art and imagination of man .
44017030	The times of ignorance God overlooked , but now he commands all people everywhere to repent ,
44017031	because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed ; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead . ”
44017032	Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked . But others said , “ We will hear you again about this . ”
44017033	So Paul went out from their midst .
44017034	But some men joined him and believed , among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them .
44018001	After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	And he found a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus , recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome . And he went to see them ,
44018003	and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked , for they were tentmakers by trade .
44018004	And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath , and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks .
44018005	When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul was occupied with the word , testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus .
44018006	And when they opposed and reviled him , he shook out his garments and said to them , “ Your blood be on your own heads ! I am innocent . From now on I will go to the Gentiles . ”
44018007	And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus , a worshiper of God . His house was next door to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord , together with his entire household . And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized .
44018009	And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision , “ Do not be afraid , but go on speaking and do not be silent ,
44018010	for I am with you , and no one will attack you to harm you , for I have many in this city who are my people . ”
44018011	And he stayed a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
44018012	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal ,
44018013	saying , “ This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law . ”
44018014	But when Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews , “ If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime , O Jews , I would have reason to accept your complaint .
44018015	But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law , see to it yourselves . I refuse to be a judge of these things . ”
44018016	And he drove them from the tribunal .
44018017	And they all seized Sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him in front of the tribunal . But Gallio paid no attention to any of this .
44018018	After this , Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria , and with him Priscilla and Aquila . At Cenchreae he had cut his hair , for he was under a vow .
44018019	And they came to Ephesus , and he left them there , but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews .
44018020	When they asked him to stay for a longer period , he declined .
44018021	But on taking leave of them he said , “ I will return to you if God wills , ” and he set sail from Ephesus .
44018022	When he had landed at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the church , and then went down to Antioch .
44018023	After spending some time there , he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples .
44018024	Now a Jew named Apollos , a native of Alexandria , came to Ephesus . He was an eloquent man , competent in the Scriptures .
44018025	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord . And being fervent in spirit , he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus , though he knew only the baptism of John .
44018026	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue , but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately .
44018027	And when he wished to cross to Achaia , the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him . When he arrived , he greatly helped those who through grace had believed ,
44018028	for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public , showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus .
44019001	And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus . There he found some disciples .
44019002	And he said to them , “ Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ” And they said , “ No , we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . ”
44019003	And he said , “ Into what then were you baptized ? ” They said , “ Into John’s baptism . ”
44019004	And Paul said , “ John baptized with the baptism of repentance , telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him , that is , Jesus . ”
44019005	On hearing this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	And when Paul had laid his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them , and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying .
44019007	There were about twelve men in all .
44019008	And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly , reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief , speaking evil of the Way before the congregation , he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him , reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This continued for two years , so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord , both Jews and Greeks .
44019011	And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul ,
44019012	so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick , and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them .
44019013	Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits , saying , “ I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims . ”
44019014	Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this .
44019015	But the evil spirit answered them , “ Jesus I know , and Paul I recognize , but who are you ? ”
44019016	And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them , mastered all of them and overpowered them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
44019017	And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus , both Jews and Greeks . And fear fell upon them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled .
44019018	Also many of those who were now believers came , confessing and divulging their practices .
44019019	And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver .
44019020	So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily .
44019021	Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem , saying , “ After I have been there , I must also see Rome . ”
44019022	And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers , Timothy and Erastus , he himself stayed in Asia for a while .
44019023	About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way .
44019024	For a man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought no little business to the craftsmen .
44019025	These he gathered together , with the workmen in similar trades , and said , “ Men , you know that from this business we have our wealth .
44019026	And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people , saying that gods made with hands are not gods .
44019027	And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing , and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence , she whom all Asia and the world worship . ”
44019028	When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44019029	So the city was filled with the confusion , and they rushed together into the theater , dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus , Macedonians who were Paul’s companions in travel .
44019030	But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd , the disciples would not let him .
44019031	And even some of the Asiarchs , who were friends of his , sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater .
44019032	Now some cried out one thing , some another , for the assembly was in confusion , and most of them did not know why they had come together .
44019033	Some of the crowd prompted Alexander , whom the Jews had put forward . And Alexander , motioning with his hand , wanted to make a defense to the crowd .
44019034	But when they recognized that he was a Jew , for about two hours they all cried out with one voice , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44019035	And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd , he said , “ Men of Ephesus , who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis , and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky ?
44019036	Seeing then that these things cannot be denied , you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash .
44019037	For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess .
44019038	If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone , the courts are open , and there are proconsuls . Let them bring charges against one another .
44019039	But if you seek anything further , it shall be settled in the regular assembly .
44019040	For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today , since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion . ”
44019041	And when he had said these things , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	After the uproar ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , and after encouraging them , he said farewell and departed for Macedonia .
44020002	When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement , he came to Greece .
44020003	There he spent three months , and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he decided to return through Macedonia .
44020004	Sopater the Berean , son of Pyrrhus , accompanied him ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy ; and the Asians , Tychicus and Trophimus .
44020005	These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas ,
44020006	but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread , and in five days we came to them at Troas , where we stayed for seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week , when we were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , intending to depart on the next day , and he prolonged his speech until midnight .
44020008	There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered .
44020009	And a young man named Eutychus , sitting at the window , sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer . And being overcome by sleep , he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead .
44020010	But Paul went down and bent over him , and taking him in his arms , said , “ Do not be alarmed , for his life is in him . ”
44020011	And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten , he conversed with them a long while , until daybreak , and so departed .
44020012	And they took the youth away alive , and were not a little comforted .
44020013	But going ahead to the ship , we set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for so he had arranged , intending himself to go by land .
44020014	And when he met us at Assos , we took him on board and went to Mitylene .
44020015	And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios ; the next day we touched at Samos ; and the day after that we went to Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus , so that he might not have to spend time in Asia , for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem , if possible , on the day of Pentecost .
44020017	Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him .
44020018	And when they came to him , he said to them : “ You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia ,
44020019	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews ;
44020020	how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable , and teaching you in public and from house to house ,
44020021	testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ .
44020022	And now , behold , I am going to Jerusalem , constrained bythe Spirit , not knowing what will happen to me there ,
44020023	except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me .
44020024	But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself , if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus , to testify to the gospel of the grace of God .
44020025	And now , behold , I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again .
44020026	Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you ,
44020027	for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God .
44020028	Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock , in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers , to care for the church of God , which he obtained with his own blood .
44020029	I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you , not sparing the flock ;
44020030	and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things , to draw away the disciples after them .
44020031	Therefore be alert , remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears .
44020032	And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace , which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified .
44020033	I coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel .
44020034	You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me .
44020035	In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he himself said , ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ ”
44020036	And when he had said these things , he knelt down and prayed with them all .
44020037	And there was much weeping on the part of all ; they embraced Paul and kissed him ,
44020038	being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken , that they would not see his face again . And they accompanied him to the ship .
44021001	And when we had parted from them and set sail , we came by a straight course to Cos , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia , we went aboard and set sail .
44021003	When we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre , for there the ship was to unload its cargo .
44021004	And having sought out the disciples , we stayed there for seven days . And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem .
44021005	When our days there were ended , we departed and went on our journey , and they all , with wives and children , accompanied us until we were outside the city . And kneeling down on the beach , we prayed
44021006	and said farewell to one another . Then we went on board the ship , and they returned home .
44021007	When we had finished the voyage from Tyre , we arrived at Ptolemais , and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day .
44021008	On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea , and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
44021009	He had four unmarried daughters , who prophesied .
44021010	While we were staying for many days , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	And coming to us , he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands and said , “ Thus says the Holy Spirit , ‘ This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ’ ”
44021012	When we heard this , we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul answered , “ What are you doing , weeping and breaking my heart ? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . ”
44021014	And since he would not be persuaded , we ceased and said , “ Let the will of the Lord be done . ”
44021015	After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us , bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus , an early disciple , with whom we should lodge .
44021017	When we had come to Jerusalem , the brothers received us gladly .
44021018	On the following day Paul went in with us to James , and all the elders were present .
44021019	After greeting them , he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44021020	And when they heard it , they glorified God . And they said to him , “ You see , brother , how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed . They are all zealous for the law ,
44021021	and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs .
44021022	What then is to be done ? They will certainly hear that you have come .
44021023	Do therefore what we tell you . We have four men who are under a vow ;
44021024	take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses , so that they may shave their heads . Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you , but that you yourself also live in observance of the law .
44021025	But as for the Gentiles who have believed , we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols , and from blood , and from what has been strangled , and from sexual immorality . ”
44021026	Then Paul took the men , and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple , giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them .
44021027	When the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , seeing him in the temple , stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him ,
44021028	crying out , “ Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place . Moreover , he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place . ”
44021029	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
44021030	Then all the city was stirred up , and the people ran together . They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple , and at once the gates were shut .
44021031	And as they were seeking to kill him , word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion .
44021032	He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them . And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains . He inquired who he was and what he had done .
44021034	Some in the crowd were shouting one thing , some another . And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar , he ordered him to be brought into the barracks .
44021035	And when he came to the steps , he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd ,
44021036	for the mob of the people followed , crying out , “ Away with him ! ”
44021037	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he said to the tribune , “ May I say something to you ? ” And he said , “ Do you know Greek ?
44021038	Are you not the Egyptian , then , who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness ? ”
44021039	Paul replied , “ I am a Jew , from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no obscure city . I beg you , permit me to speak to the people . ”
44021040	And when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the steps , motioned with his hand to the people . And when there was a great hush , he addressed them in the Hebrew language , saying :
44022001	“ Brothers and fathers , hear the defense that I now make before you . ”
44022002	And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language , they became even more quiet . And he said :
44022003	“ I am a Jew , born in Tarsus in Cilicia , but brought up in this city , educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers , being zealous for God as all of you are this day .
44022004	I persecuted this Way to the death , binding and delivering to prison both men and women ,
44022005	as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness . From them I received letters to the brothers , and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished .
44022006	“ As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus , about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me .
44022007	And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ’
44022008	And I answered , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And he said to me , ‘ I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you are persecuting . ’
44022009	Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me .
44022010	And I said , ‘ What shall I do , Lord ? ’ And the Lord said to me , ‘ Rise , and go into Damascus , and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do . ’
44022011	And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light , I was led by the hand by those who were with me , and came into Damascus .
44022012	“ And one Ananias , a devout man according to the law , well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there ,
44022013	came to me , and standing by me said to me , ‘ Brother Saul , receive your sight . ’ And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him .
44022014	And he said , ‘ The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will , to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth ;
44022015	for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	And now why do you wait ? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins , calling on his name . ’
44022017	“ When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple , I fell into a trance
44022018	and saw him saying to me , ‘ Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly , because they will not accept your testimony about me . ’
44022019	And I said , ‘ Lord , they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you .
44022020	And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed , I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him . ’
44022021	And he said to me , ‘ Go , for I will send you far away to the Gentiles . ’ ”
44022022	Up to this word they listened to him . Then they raised their voices and said , “ Away with such a fellow from the earth ! For he should not be allowed to live . ”
44022023	And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air ,
44022024	the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks , saying that he should be examined by flogging , to find out why they were shouting against him like this .
44022025	But when they had stretched him out for the whips , Paul said to the centurion who was standing by , “ Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned ? ”
44022026	When the centurion heard this , he went to the tribune and said to him , “ What are you about to do ? For this man is a Roman citizen . ”
44022027	So the tribune came and said to him , “ Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? ” And he said , “ Yes . ”
44022028	The tribune answered , “ I bought this citizenship for a large sum . ” Paul said , “ But I am a citizen by birth . ”
44022029	So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately , and the tribune also was afraid , for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him .
44022030	But on the next day , desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews , he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet , and he brought Paul down and set him before them .
44023001	And looking intently at the council , Paul said , “ Brothers , I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day . ”
44023002	And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , “ God is going to strike you , you whitewashed wall ! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law , and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck ? ”
44023004	Those who stood by said , “ Would you revile God’s high priest ? ”
44023005	And Paul said , “ I did not know , brothers , that he was the high priest , for it is written , ‘ You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people . ’ ”
44023006	Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , “ Brothers , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees . It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial . ”
44023007	And when he had said this , a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , nor angel , nor spirit , but the Pharisees acknowledge them all .
44023009	Then a great clamor arose , and some of the scribes of the Pharisees ’ party stood up and contended sharply , “ We find nothing wrong in this man . What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him ? ”
44023010	And when the dissension became violent , the tribune , afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks .
44023011	The following night the Lord stood by him and said , “ Take courage , for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem , so you must testify also in Rome . ”
44023012	When it was day , the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty who made this conspiracy .
44023014	They went to the chief priests and elders and said , “ We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul .
44023015	Now therefore you , along with the council , give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you , as though you were going to determine his case more exactly . And we are ready to kill him before he comes near . ”
44023016	Now the son of Paul’s sister heard of their ambush , so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul .
44023017	Paul called one of the centurions and said , “ Take this young man to the tribune , for he has something to tell him . ”
44023018	So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said , “ Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you , as he has something to say to you . ”
44023019	The tribune took him by the hand , and going aside asked him privately , “ What is it that you have to tell me ? ”
44023020	And he said , “ The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow , as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him .
44023021	But do not be persuaded by them , for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him , who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him . And now they are ready , waiting for your consent . ”
44023022	So the tribune dismissed the young man , charging him , “ Tell no one that you have informed me of these things . ”
44023023	Then he called two of the centurions and said , “ Get ready two hundred soldiers , with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night .
44023024	Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor . ”
44023025	And he wrote a letter to this effect :
44023026	“ Claudius Lysias , to his Excellency the governor Felix , greetings .
44023027	This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman citizen .
44023028	And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him , I brought him down to their council .
44023029	I found that he was being accused about questions of their law , but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment .
44023030	And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man , I sent him to you at once , ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him . ”
44023031	So the soldiers , according to their instructions , took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	And on the next day they returned to the barracks , letting the horsemen go on with him .
44023033	When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , they presented Paul also before him .
44023034	On reading the letter , he asked what province he was from . And when he learned that he was from Cilicia ,
44023035	he said , “ I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive . ” And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod’s praetorium .
44024001	And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman , one Tertullus . They laid before the governor their case against Paul .
44024002	And when he had been summoned , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying : “ Since through you we enjoy much peace , and since by your foresight , most excellent Felix , reforms are being made for this nation ,
44024003	in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude .
44024004	But , to detainyou no further , I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly .
44024005	For we have found this man a plague , one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
44024006	He even tried to profane the temple , but we seized him .
44024008	By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him . ”
44024009	The Jews also joined in the charge , affirming that all these things were so .
44024010	And when the governor had nodded to him to speak , Paul replied : “ Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation , I cheerfully make my defense .
44024011	You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem ,
44024012	and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd , either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city .
44024013	Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me .
44024014	But this I confess to you , that according to the Way , which they call a sect , I worship the God of our fathers , believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets ,
44024015	having a hope in God , which these men themselves accept , that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust .
44024016	So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man .
44024017	Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings .
44024018	While I was doing this , they found me purified in the temple , without any crowd or tumult . But some Jews from Asia —
44024019	they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation , should they have anything against me .
44024020	Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council ,
44024021	other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them : ‘ It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day . ’ ”
44024022	But Felix , having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way , put them off , saying , “ When Lysias the tribune comes down , I will decide your case . ”
44024023	Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty , and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs .
44024024	After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla , who was Jewish , and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment , Felix was alarmed and said , “ Go away for the present . When I get an opportunity I will summon you . ”
44024026	At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul . So he sent for him often and conversed with him .
44024027	When two years had elapsed , Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus . And desiring to do the Jews a favor , Felix left Paul in prison .
44025001	Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province , he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul , and they urged him ,
44025003	asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem — because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way .
44025004	Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly .
44025005	“ So , ” said he , “ let the men of authority among you go down with me , and if there is anything wrong about the man , let them bring charges against him . ”
44025006	After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days , he went down to Caesarea . And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought .
44025007	When he had arrived , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove .
44025008	Paul argued in his defense , “ Neither against the law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar have I committed any offense . ”
44025009	But Festus , wishing to do the Jews a favor , said to Paul , “ Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me ? ”
44025010	But Paul said , “ I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal , where I ought to be tried . To the Jews I have done no wrong , as you yourself know very well .
44025011	If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die , I do not seek to escape death . But if there is nothing to their charges against me , no one can give me up to them . I appeal to Caesar . ”
44025012	Then Festus , when he had conferred with his council , answered , “ To Caesar you have appealed ; to Caesar you shall go . ”
44025013	Now when some days had passed , Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus .
44025014	And as they stayed there many days , Festus laid Paul’s case before the king , saying , “ There is a man left prisoner by Felix ,
44025015	and when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him , asking for a sentence of condemnation against him .
44025016	I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him .
44025017	So when they came together here , I made no delay , but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought .
44025018	When the accusers stood up , they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed .
44025019	Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus , who was dead , but whom Paul asserted to be alive .
44025020	Being at a loss how to investigate these questions , I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them .
44025021	But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor , I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar . ”
44025022	Then Agrippa said to Festus , “ I would like to hear the man myself . ” “ Tomorrow , ” said he , “ you will hear him . ”
44025023	So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp , and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city . Then , at the command of Festus , Paul was brought in .
44025024	And Festus said , “ King Agrippa and all who are present with us , you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me , both in Jerusalem and here , shouting that he ought not to live any longer .
44025025	But I found that he had done nothing deserving death . And as he himself appealed to the emperor , I decided to go ahead and send him .
44025026	But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him . Therefore I have brought him before you all , and especially before you , King Agrippa , so that , after we have examined him , I may have something to write .
44025027	For it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to indicate the charges against him . ”
44026001	So Agrippa said to Paul , “ You have permission to speak for yourself . ” Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense :
44026002	“ I consider myself fortunate that it is before you , King Agrippa , I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews ,
44026003	especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews . Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently .
44026004	“ My manner of life from my youth , spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem , is known by all the Jews .
44026005	They have known for a long time , if they are willing to testify , that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee .
44026006	And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers ,
44026007	to which our twelve tribes hope to attain , as they earnestly worship night and day . And for this hope I am accused by Jews , O king !
44026008	Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead ?
44026009	“ I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	And I did so in Jerusalem . I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests , but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them .
44026011	And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme , and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities .
44026012	“ In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests .
44026013	At midday , O king , I saw on the way a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , that shone around me and those who journeyed with me .
44026014	And when we had all fallen to the ground , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goads . ’
44026015	And I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And the Lord said , ‘ I am Jesus whom you are persecuting .
44026016	But rise and stand upon your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose , to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you ,
44026017	delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles — to whom I am sending you
44026018	to open their eyes , so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me . ’
44026019	“ Therefore , O King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
44026020	but declared first to those in Damascus , then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea , and also to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , performing deeds in keeping with their repentance .
44026021	For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me .
44026022	To this day I have had the help that comes from God , and so I stand here testifying both to small and great , saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass :
44026023	that the Christ must suffer and that , by being the first to rise from the dead , he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles . ”
44026024	And as he was saying these things in his defense , Festus said with a loud voice , “ Paul , you are out of your mind ; your great learning is driving you out of your mind . ”
44026025	But Paul said , “ I am not out of my mind , most excellent Festus , but I am speaking true and rational words .
44026026	For the king knows about these things , and to him I speak boldly . For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice , for this has not been done in a corner .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you believe . ”
44026028	And Agrippa said to Paul , “ In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian ? ”
44026029	And Paul said , “ Whether short or long , I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am — except for these chains . ”
44026030	Then the king rose , and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them .
44026031	And when they had withdrawn , they said to one another , “ This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment . ”
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , “ This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar . ”
44027001	And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius .
44027002	And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium , which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia , we put to sea , accompanied by Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica .
44027003	The next day we put in at Sidon . And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for .
44027004	And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus , because the winds were against us .
44027005	And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board .
44027007	We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus , and as the wind did not allow us to go farther , we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone .
44027008	Coasting along it with difficulty , we came to a place called Fair Havens , near which was the city of Lasea .
44027009	Since much time had passed , and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over , Paul advised them ,
44027010	saying , “ Sirs , I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss , not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . ”
44027011	But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said .
44027012	And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in , the majority decided to put out to sea from there , on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix , a harbor of Crete , facing both southwest and northwest , and spend the winter there .
44027013	Now when the south wind blew gently , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete , close to the shore .
44027014	But soon a tempestuous wind , called the northeaster , struck down from the land .
44027015	And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind , we gave way to it and were driven along .
44027016	Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda , we managed with difficulty to secure the ship’s boat .
44027017	After hoisting it up , they used supports to undergird the ship . Then , fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis , they lowered the gear , and thus they were driven along .
44027018	Since we were violently storm-tossed , they began the next day to jettison the cargo .
44027019	And on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands .
44027020	When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned .
44027021	Since they had been without food for a long time , Paul stood up among them and said , “ Men , you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss .
44027022	Yet now I urge you to take heart , for there will be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
44027023	For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship ,
44027024	and he said , ‘ Do not be afraid , Paul ; you must stand before Caesar . And behold , God has granted you all those who sail with you . ’
44027025	So take heart , men , for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told .
44027026	But we must run aground on some island . ”
44027027	When the fourteenth night had come , as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land .
44027028	So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms . A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms .
44027029	And fearing that we might run on the rocks , they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come .
44027030	And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship , and had lowered the ship’s boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow ,
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers , “ Unless these men stay in the ship , you cannot be saved . ”
44027032	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it go .
44027033	As day was about to dawn , Paul urged them all to take some food , saying , “ Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food , having taken nothing .
44027034	Therefore I urge you to take some food . For it will give you strength , for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you . ”
44027035	And when he had said these things , he took bread , and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat .
44027036	Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves .
44027037	( We were in all 276 persons in the ship .
44027038	And when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
44027039	Now when it was day , they did not recognize the land , but they noticed a bay with a beach , on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore .
44027040	So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea , at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders . Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach .
44027041	But striking a reef , they ran the vessel aground . The bow stuck and remained immovable , and the stern was being broken up by the surf .
44027042	The soldiers ’ plan was to kill the prisoners , lest any should swim away and escape .
44027043	But the centurion , wishing to save Paul , kept them from carrying out their plan . He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land ,
44027044	and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship . And so it was that all were brought safely to land .
44028001	After we were brought safely through , we then learned that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The native people showed us unusual kindness , for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all , because it had begun to rain and was cold .
44028003	When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand .
44028004	When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said to one another , “ No doubt this man is a murderer . Though he has escaped from the sea , Justice has not allowed him to live . ”
44028005	He , however , shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm .
44028006	They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead . But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him , they changed their minds and said that he was a god .
44028007	Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island , named Publius , who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days .
44028008	It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery . And Paul visited him and prayed , and putting his hands on him healed him .
44028009	And when this had taken place , the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured .
44028010	They also honored us greatly , and when we were about to sail , they put on board whatever we needed .
44028011	After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island , a ship of Alexandria , with the twin gods as a figurehead .
44028012	Putting in at Syracuse , we stayed there for three days .
44028013	And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium . And after one day a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Puteoli .
44028014	There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days . And so we came to Rome .
44028015	And the brothers there , when they heard about us , came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us . On seeing them , Paul thanked God and took courage .
44028016	And when we came into Rome , Paul was allowed to stay by himself , with the soldier that guarded him .
44028017	After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews , and when they had gathered , he said to them , “ Brothers , though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers , yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
44028018	When they had examined me , they wished to set me at liberty , because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case .
44028019	But because the Jews objected , I was compelled to appeal to Caesar — though I had no charge to bring against my nation .
44028020	For this reason , therefore , I have asked to see you and speak with you , since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain . ”
44028021	And they said to him , “ We have received no letters from Judea about you , and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you .
44028022	But we desire to hear from you what your views are , for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against . ”
44028023	When they had appointed a day for him , they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers . From morning till evening he expounded to them , testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets .
44028024	And some were convinced by what he said , but others disbelieved .
44028025	And disagreeing among themselves , they departed after Paul had made one statement : “ The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet :
44028026	“ ‘ Go to this people , and say , You will indeed hear but never understand , and you will indeed see but never perceive .
44028027	For this people’s heart has grown dull , and with their ears they can barely hear , and their eyes they have closed ; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn , and I would heal them . ’
44028028	Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles ; they will listen . ”
44028030	He lived there two whole years at his own expense , and welcomed all who came to him ,
44028031	proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance .
45001001	Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle , set apart for the gospel of God ,
45001002	which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures ,
45001003	concerning his Son , who was descended from David according to the flesh
45001004	and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
45001005	through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations ,
45001006	including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ ,
45001007	To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is proclaimed in all the world .
45001009	For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I mention you
45001010	always in my prayers , asking that somehow by God’s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you .
45001011	For I long to see you , that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you —
45001012	that is , that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith , both yours and mine .
45001013	I want you to know , brothers , that I have often intended to come to you ( but thus far have been prevented ) , in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles .
45001014	I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians , both to the wise and to the foolish .
45001015	So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel , for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45001017	For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith , as it is written , “ The righteous shall live by faith . ”
45001018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth .
45001019	For what can be known about God is plain to them , because God has shown it to them .
45001020	For his invisible attributes , namely , his eternal power and divine nature , have been clearly perceived , ever since the creation of the world , in the things that have been made . So they are without excuse .
45001021	For although they knew God , they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him , but they became futile in their thinking , and their foolish hearts were darkened .
45001022	Claiming to be wise , they became fools ,
45001023	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things .
45001024	Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity , to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves ,
45001025	because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever ! Amen .
45001026	For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions . For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature ;
45001027	and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another , men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error .
45001028	And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God , God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done .
45001029	They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness , evil , covetousness , malice . They are full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , maliciousness . They are gossips ,
45001030	slanderers , haters of God , insolent , haughty , boastful , inventors of evil , disobedient to parents ,
45001031	foolish , faithless , heartless , ruthless .
45001032	Though they know God’s decree that those who practice such things deserve to die , they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them .
45002001	Therefore you have no excuse , O man , every one of you who judges . For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself , because you , the judge , practice the very same things .
45002002	We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things .
45002003	Do you suppose , O man — you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself — that you will escape the judgment of God ?
45002004	Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience , not knowing that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance ?
45002005	But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed .
45002006	He will render to each one according to his works :
45002007	to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality , he will give eternal life ;
45002008	but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , there will be wrath and fury .
45002009	There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil , the Jew first and also the Greek ,
45002010	but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good , the Jew first and also the Greek .
45002011	For God shows no partiality .
45002012	For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law , and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
45002013	For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God , but the doers of the law who will be justified .
45002014	For when Gentiles , who do not have the law , by nature do what the law requires , they are a law to themselves , even though they do not have the law .
45002015	They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts , while their conscience also bears witness , and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
45002016	on that day when , according to my gospel , God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus .
45002017	But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God
45002018	and know his will and approve what is excellent , because you are instructed from the law ;
45002019	and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45002020	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of children , having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth —
45002021	you then who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? While you preach against stealing , do you steal ?
45002022	You who say that one must not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law .
45002024	For , as it is written , “ The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you . ”
45002025	For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law , but if you break the law , your circumcision becomes uncircumcision .
45002026	So , if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision ?
45002027	Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law .
45002028	For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly , nor is circumcision outward and physical .
45002029	But a Jew is one inwardly , and circumcision is a matter of the heart , by the Spirit , not by the letter . His praise is not from man but from God .
45003001	Then what advantage has the Jew ? Or what is the value of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way . To begin with , the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God .
45003003	What if some were unfaithful ? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God ?
45003004	By no means ! Let God be true though every one were a liar , as it is written , “ That you may be justified in your words , and prevail when you are judged . ”
45003005	But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us ? ( I speak in a human way .
45003006	By no means ! For then how could God judge the world ?
45003007	But if through my lie God’s truth abounds to his glory , why am I still being condemned as a sinner ?
45003008	And why not do evil that good may come ? — as some people slanderously charge us with saying . Their condemnation is just .
45003009	What then ? Are we Jews any better off ? No , not at all . For we have already charged that all , both Jews and Greeks , are under sin ,
45003010	as it is written : “ None is righteous , no , not one ;
45003011	no one understands ; no one seeks for God .
45003012	All have turned aside ; together they have become worthless ; no one does good , not even one . ”
45003013	“ Their throat is an open grave ; they use their tongues to deceive . ” “ The venom of asps is under their lips . ”
45003014	“ Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness . ”
45003015	“ Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
45003016	in their paths are ruin and misery ,
45003017	and the way of peace they have not known . ”
45003018	“ There is no fear of God before their eyes . ”
45003019	Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be stopped , and the whole world may be held accountable to God .
45003020	For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight , since through the law comes knowledge of sin .
45003021	But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law , although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it —
45003022	the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe . For there is no distinction :
45003023	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
45003024	and are justified by his grace as a gift , through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ,
45003025	whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood , to be received by faith . This was to show God’s righteousness , because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins .
45003026	It was to show his righteousness at the present time , so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus .
45003027	Then what becomes of our boasting ? It is excluded . By what kind of law ? By a law of works ? No , but by the law of faith .
45003028	For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law .
45003029	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Is he not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
45003030	since God is one — who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith .
45003031	Do we then overthrow the law by this faith ? By no means ! On the contrary , we uphold the law .
45004001	What then shall we say was gained by Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh ?
45004002	For if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not before God .
45004003	For what does the Scripture say ? “ Abraham believed God , and it was counted to him as righteousness . ”
45004004	Now to the one who works , his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due .
45004005	And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is counted as righteousness ,
45004006	just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works :
45004007	“ Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven , and whose sins are covered ;
45004008	blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin . ”
45004009	Is this blessing then only for the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness .
45004010	How then was it counted to him ? Was it before or after he had been circumcised ? It was not after , but before he was circumcised .
45004011	He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised . The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised , so that righteousness would be counted to them as well ,
45004012	and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
45004013	For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith .
45004014	For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs , faith is null and the promise is void .
45004015	For the law brings wrath , but where there is no law there is no transgression .
45004016	That is why it depends on faith , in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring — not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all ,
45004017	as it is written , “ I have made you the father of many nations ” — in the presence of the God in whom he believed , who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist .
45004018	In hope he believed against hope , that he should become the father of many nations , as he had been told , “ So shall your offspring be . ”
45004019	He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body , which was as good as dead ( since he was about a hundred years old ) , or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb .
45004020	No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God , but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God ,
45004021	fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised .
45004022	That is why his faith was “ counted to him as righteousness . ”
45004023	But the words “ it was counted to him ” were not written for his sake alone ,
45004024	but for ours also . It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord ,
45004025	who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification .
45005001	Therefore , since we have been justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ .
45005002	Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand , and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
45005003	More than that , we rejoice in our sufferings , knowing that suffering produces endurance ,
45005004	and endurance produces character , and character produces hope ,
45005005	and hope does not put us to shame , because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us .
45005006	For while we were still weak , at the right time Christ died for the ungodly .
45005007	For one will scarcely die for a righteous person — though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die —
45005008	but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
45005009	Since , therefore , we have now been justified by his blood , much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God .
45005010	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , now that we are reconciled , shall we be saved by his life .
45005011	More than that , we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received reconciliation .
45005012	Therefore , just as sin came into the world through one man , and death through sin , and so death spread to all men because all sinned —
45005013	for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given , but sin is not counted where there is no law .
45005014	Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam , who was a type of the one who was to come .
45005015	But the free gift is not like the trespass . For if many died through one man’s trespass , much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many .
45005016	And the free gift is not like the result of that one man’s sin . For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation , but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification .
45005017	For if , because of one man’s trespass , death reigned through that one man , much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ .
45005018	Therefore , as one trespass led to condemnation for all men , so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men .
45005019	For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners , so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous .
45005020	Now the law came in to increase the trespass , but where sin increased , grace abounded all the more ,
45005021	so that , as sin reigned in death , grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	What shall we say then ? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound ?
45006002	By no means ! How can we who died to sin still live in it ?
45006003	Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
45006004	We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death , in order that , just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father , we too might walk in newness of life .
45006005	For if we have been united with him in a death like his , we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his .
45006006	We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing , so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin .
45006007	For one who has died has been set free from sin .
45006008	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
45006009	We know that Christ , being raised from the dead , will never die again ; death no longer has dominion over him .
45006010	For the death he died he died to sin , once for all , but the life he lives he lives to God .
45006011	So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , to make you obey its passions .
45006013	Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life , and your members to God as instruments for righteousness .
45006014	For sin will have no dominion over you , since you are not under law but under grace .
45006015	What then ? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace ? By no means !
45006016	Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves , you are slaves of the one whom you obey , either of sin , which leads to death , or of obedience , which leads to righteousness ?
45006017	But thanks be to God , that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed ,
45006018	and , having been set free from sin , have become slaves of righteousness .
45006019	I am speaking in human terms , because of your natural limitations . For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness , so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification .
45006020	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
45006021	But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God , the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end , eternal life .
45006023	For the wages of sin is death , but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Or do you not know , brothers — for I am speaking to those who know the law — that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives ?
45007002	For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives , but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage .
45007003	Accordingly , she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free from that law , and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress .
45007004	Likewise , my brothers , you also have died to the law through the body of Christ , so that you may belong to another , to him who has been raised from the dead , in order that we may bear fruit for God .
45007005	For while we were living in the flesh , our sinful passions , aroused by the law , were at work in our members to bear fruit for death .
45007006	But now we are released from the law , having died to that which held us captive , so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code .
45007007	What then shall we say ? That the law is sin ? By no means ! Yet if it had not been for the law , I would not have known sin . For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said , “ You shall not covet . ”
45007008	But sin , seizing an opportunity through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of covetousness . For apart from the law , sin lies dead .
45007009	I was once alive apart from the law , but when the commandment came , sin came alive and I died .
45007010	The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me .
45007011	For sin , seizing an opportunity through the commandment , deceived me and through it killed me .
45007012	So the law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
45007013	Did that which is good , then , bring death to me ? By no means ! It was sin , producing death in me through what is good , in order that sin might be shown to be sin , and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure .
45007014	For we know that the law is spiritual , but I am of the flesh , sold under sin .
45007015	For I do not understand my own actions . For I do not do what I want , but I do the very thing I hate .
45007016	Now if I do what I do not want , I agree with the law , that it is good .
45007017	So now it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells within me .
45007018	For I know that nothing good dwells in me , that is , in my flesh . For I have the desire to do what is right , but not the ability to carry it out .
45007019	For I do not do the good I want , but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing .
45007020	Now if I do what I do not want , it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells within me .
45007021	So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right , evil lies close at hand .
45007022	For I delight in the law of God , in my inner being ,
45007023	but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members .
45007024	Wretched man that I am ! Who will deliver me from this body of death ?
45007025	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I myself serve the law of God with my mind , but with my flesh I serve the law of sin .
45008001	There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death .
45008003	For God has done what the law , weakened by the flesh , could not do . By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ,
45008004	in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
45008005	For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit .
45008006	For to set the mind on the flesh is death , but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace .
45008007	For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God , for it does not submit to God’s law ; indeed , it cannot .
45008008	Those who are in the flesh cannot please God .
45008009	You , however , are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you . Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him .
45008010	But if Christ is in you , although the body is dead because of sin , the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
45008011	If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you .
45008012	So then , brothers , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
45008013	For if you live according to the flesh you will die , but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
45008014	For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God .
45008015	For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear , but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons , by whom we cry , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
45008016	The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God ,
45008017	and if children , then heirs — heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ , provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him .
45008018	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us .
45008019	For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God .
45008020	For the creation was subjected to futility , not willingly , but because of him who subjected it , in hope
45008021	that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God .
45008022	For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now .
45008023	And not only the creation , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons , the redemption of our bodies .
45008024	For in this hope we were saved . Now hope that is seen is not hope . For who hopes for what he sees ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we do not see , we wait for it with patience .
45008026	Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness . For we do not know what to pray for as we ought , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words .
45008027	And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God .
45008028	And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good , for those who are called according to his purpose .
45008029	For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers .
45008030	And those whom he predestined he also called , and those whom he called he also justified , and those whom he justified he also glorified .
45008031	What then shall we say to these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all , how will he not also with him graciously give us all things ?
45008033	Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect ? It is God who justifies .
45008034	Who is to condemn ? Christ Jesus is the one who died — more than that , who was raised — who is at the right hand of God , who indeed is interceding for us .
45008035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
45008036	As it is written , “ For your sake we are being killed all the day long ; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered . ”
45008037	No , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
45008038	For I am sure that neither death nor life , nor angels nor rulers , nor things present nor things to come , nor powers ,
45008039	nor height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I am speaking the truth in Christ — I am not lying ; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit —
45009002	that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart .
45009003	For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers , my kinsmen according to the flesh .
45009004	They are Israelites , and to them belong the adoption , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the worship , and the promises .
45009005	To them belong the patriarchs , and from their race , according to the flesh , is the Christ who is God over all , blessed forever . Amen .
45009006	But it is not as though the word of God has failed . For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel ,
45009007	and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring , but “ Through Isaac shall your offspring be named . ”
45009008	This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God , but the children of the promise are counted as offspring .
45009009	For this is what the promise said : “ About this time next year I will return , and Sarah shall have a son . ”
45009010	And not only so , but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man , our forefather Isaac ,
45009011	though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad — in order that God’s purpose of election might continue , not because of works but because of him who calls —
45009012	she was told , “ The older will serve the younger . ”
45009013	As it is written , “ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . ”
45009014	What shall we say then ? Is there injustice on God’s part ? By no means !
45009015	For he says to Moses , “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . ”
45009016	So then it depends not on human will or exertion , but on God , who has mercy .
45009017	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ For this very purpose I have raised you up , that I might show my power in you , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . ”
45009018	So then he has mercy on whomever he wills , and he hardens whomever he wills .
45009019	You will say to me then , “ Why does he still find fault ? For who can resist his will ? ”
45009020	But who are you , O man , to answer back to God ? Will what is molded say to its molder , “ Why have you made me like this ? ”
45009021	Has the potter no right over the clay , to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use ?
45009022	What if God , desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power , has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction ,
45009023	in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy , which he has prepared beforehand for glory —
45009024	even us whom he has called , not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles ?
45009025	As indeed he says in Hosea , “ Those who were not my people I will call ‘ my people , ’ and her who was not beloved I will call ‘ beloved . ’ ”
45009026	“ And in the very place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they will be called ‘ sons of the living God . ’ ”
45009027	And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel : “ Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea , only a remnant of them will be saved ,
45009028	for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay . ”
45009029	And as Isaiah predicted , “ If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring , we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah . ”
45009030	What shall we say , then ? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it , that is , a righteousness that is by faith ;
45009031	but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law .
45009032	Why ? Because they did not pursue it by faith , but as if it were based on works . They have stumbled over the stumbling stone ,
45009033	as it is written , “ Behold , I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense ; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame . ”
45010001	Brothers , my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved .
45010002	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
45010003	For , being ignorant of the righteousness of God , and seeking to establish their own , they did not submit to God’s righteousness .
45010004	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes .
45010005	For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law , that the person who does the commandments shall live by them .
45010006	But the righteousness based on faith says , “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring Christ down
45010007	or “ ‘ Who will descend into the abyss ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
45010008	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” ( that is , the word of faith that we proclaim ) ;
45010009	because , if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	For with the heart one believes and is justified , and with the mouth one confesses and is saved .
45010011	For the Scripture says , “ Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame . ”
45010012	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , bestowing his riches on all who call on him .
45010013	For “ everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . ”
45010014	How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard ? And how are they to hear without someone preaching ?
45010015	And how are they to preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , “ How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news ! ”
45010016	But they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed what he has heard from us ? ”
45010017	So faith comes from hearing , and hearing through the word of Christ .
45010018	But I ask , have they not heard ? Indeed they have , for “ Their voice has gone out to all the earth , and their words to the ends of the world . ”
45010019	But I ask , did Israel not understand ? First Moses says , “ I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation ; with a foolish nation I will make you angry . ”
45010020	Then Isaiah is so bold as to say , “ I have been found by those who did not seek me ; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me . ”
45010021	But of Israel he says , “ All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people . ”
45011001	I ask , then , has God rejected his people ? By no means ! For I myself am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , a member of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew . Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah , how he appeals to God against Israel ?
45011003	“ Lord , they have killed your prophets , they have demolished your altars , and I alone am left , and they seek my life . ”
45011004	But what is God’s reply to him ? “ I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal . ”
45011005	So too at the present time there is a remnant , chosen by grace .
45011006	But if it is by grace , it is no longer on the basis of works ; otherwise grace would no longer be grace .
45011007	What then ? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking . The elect obtained it , but the rest were hardened ,
45011008	as it is written , “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear , down to this very day . ”
45011009	And David says , “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them ;
45011010	let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see , and bend their backs forever . ”
45011011	So I ask , did they stumble in order that they might fall ? By no means ! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles , so as to make Israel jealous .
45011012	Now if their trespass means riches for the world , and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their full inclusion mean !
45011013	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I magnify my ministry
45011014	in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous , and thus save some of them .
45011015	For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead ?
45011016	If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy , so is the whole lump , and if the root is holy , so are the branches .
45011017	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you , although a wild olive shoot , were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree ,
45011018	do not be arrogant toward the branches . If you are , remember it is not you who support the root , but the root that supports you .
45011019	Then you will say , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in . ”
45011020	That is true . They were broken off because of their unbelief , but you stand fast through faith . So do not become proud , but fear .
45011021	For if God did not spare the natural branches , neither will he spare you .
45011022	Note then the kindness and the severity of God : severity toward those who have fallen , but God’s kindness to you , provided you continue in his kindness . Otherwise you too will be cut off .
45011023	And even they , if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God has the power to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and grafted , contrary to nature , into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these , the natural branches , be grafted back into their own olive tree .
45011025	Lest you be wise in your own sight , I want you to understand this mystery , brothers : a partial hardening has come upon Israel , until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in .
45011026	And in this way all Israel will be saved , as it is written , “ The Deliverer will come from Zion , he will banish ungodliness from Jacob ” ;
45011027	“ and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins . ”
45011028	As regards the gospel , they are enemies of God for your sake . But as regards election , they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers .
45011029	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable .
45011030	For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience ,
45011031	so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy .
45011032	For God has consigned all to disobedience , that he may have mercy on all .
45011033	Oh , the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways !
45011034	“ For who has known the mind of the Lord , or who has been his counselor ? ”
45011035	“ Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid ? ”
45011036	For from him and through him and to him are all things . To him be glory forever . Amen .
45012001	I appeal to you therefore , brothers , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God , which is your spiritual worship .
45012002	Do not be conformed to this world , but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that by testing you may discern what is the will of God , what is good and acceptable and perfect .
45012003	For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think , but to think with sober judgment , each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned .
45012004	For as in one body we have many members , and the members do not all have the same function ,
45012005	so we , though many , are one body in Christ , and individually members one of another .
45012006	Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us , let us use them : if prophecy , in proportion to our faith ;
45012007	if service , in our serving ; the one who teaches , in his teaching ;
45012008	the one who exhorts , in his exhortation ; the one who contributes , in generosity ; the one who leads , with zeal ; the one who does acts of mercy , with cheerfulness .
45012009	Let love be genuine . Abhor what is evil ; hold fast to what is good .
45012010	Love one another with brotherly affection . Outdo one another in showing honor .
45012011	Do not be slothful in zeal , be fervent in spirit , serve the Lord .
45012012	Rejoice in hope , be patient in tribulation , be constant in prayer .
45012013	Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you ; bless and do not curse them .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep .
45012016	Live in harmony with one another . Do not be haughty , but associate with the lowly . Never be wise in your own sight .
45012017	Repay no one evil for evil , but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all .
45012018	If possible , so far as it depends on you , live peaceably with all .
45012019	Beloved , never avenge yourselves , but leave it to the wrath of God , for it is written , “ Vengeance is mine , I will repay , says the Lord . ”
45012020	To the contrary , “ if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him something to drink ; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head . ”
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
45013001	Let every person be subject to the governing authorities . For there is no authority except from God , and those that exist have been instituted by God .
45013002	Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed , and those who resist will incur judgment .
45013003	For rulers are not a terror to good conduct , but to bad . Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority ? Then do what is good , and you will receive his approval ,
45013004	for he is God’s servant for your good . But if you do wrong , be afraid , for he does not bear the sword in vain . For he is the servant of God , an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer .
45013005	Therefore one must be in subjection , not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience .
45013006	For because of this you also pay taxes , for the authorities are ministers of God , attending to this very thing .
45013007	Pay to all what is owed to them : taxes to whom taxes are owed , revenue to whom revenue is owed , respect to whom respect is owed , honor to whom honor is owed .
45013008	Owe no one anything , except to love each other , for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law .
45013009	For the commandments , “ You shall not commit adultery , You shall not murder , You shall not steal , You shall not covet , ” and any other commandment , are summed up in this word : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
45013010	Love does no wrong to a neighbor ; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law .
45013011	Besides this you know the time , that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep . For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed .
45013012	The night is far gone ; the day is at hand . So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light .
45013013	Let us walk properly as in the daytime , not in orgies and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and sensuality , not in quarreling and jealousy .
45013014	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh , to gratify its desires .
45014001	As for the one who is weak in faith , welcome him , but not to quarrel over opinions .
45014002	One person believes he may eat anything , while the weak person eats only vegetables .
45014003	Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains , and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats , for God has welcomed him .
45014004	Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another ? It is before his own master that he stands or falls . And he will be upheld , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
45014005	One person esteems one day as better than another , while another esteems all days alike . Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind .
45014006	The one who observes the day , observes it in honor of the Lord . The one who eats , eats in honor of the Lord , since he gives thanks to God , while the one who abstains , abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God .
45014007	For none of us lives to himself , and none of us dies to himself .
45014008	For if we live , we live to the Lord , and if we die , we die to the Lord . So then , whether we live or whether we die , we are the Lord’s .
45014009	For to this end Christ died and lived again , that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living .
45014010	Why do you pass judgment on your brother ? Or you , why do you despise your brother ? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God ;
45014011	for it is written , “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God . ”
45014012	So then each of us will give an account of himself to God .
45014013	Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer , but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother .
45014014	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself , but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean .
45014015	For if your brother is grieved by what you eat , you are no longer walking in love . By what you eat , do not destroy the one for whom Christ died .
45014016	So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil .
45014017	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men .
45014019	So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding .
45014020	Do not , for the sake of food , destroy the work of God . Everything is indeed clean , but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats .
45014021	It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble .
45014022	The faith that you have , keep between yourself and God . Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves .
45014023	But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats , because the eating is not from faith . For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin .
45015001	We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
45015002	Let each of us please his neighbor for his good , to build him up .
45015003	For Christ did not please himself , but as it is written , “ The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me . ”
45015004	For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction , that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope .
45015005	May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another , in accord with Christ Jesus ,
45015006	that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you , for the glory of God .
45015008	For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God’s truthfulness , in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs ,
45015009	and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . As it is written , “ Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles , and sing to your name . ”
45015010	And again it is said , “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , with his people . ”
45015011	And again , “ Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and let all the peoples extol him . ”
45015012	And again Isaiah says , “ The root of Jesse will come , even he who arises to rule the Gentiles ; in him will the Gentiles hope . ”
45015013	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope .
45015014	I myself am satisfied about you , my brothers , that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another .
45015015	But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder , because of the grace given me by God
45015016	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God , so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	In Christ Jesus , then , I have reason to be proud of my work for God .
45015018	For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience — by word and deed ,
45015019	by the power of signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God — so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ ;
45015020	and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel , not where Christ has already been named , lest I build on someone else’s foundation ,
45015021	but as it is written , “ Those who have never been told of him will see , and those who have never heard will understand . ”
45015022	This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you .
45015023	But now , since I no longer have any room for work in these regions , and since I have longed for many years to come to you ,
45015024	I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain , and to be helped on my journey there by you , once I have enjoyed your company for a while .
45015025	At present , however , I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints .
45015026	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem .
45015027	For they were pleased to do it , and indeed they owe it to them . For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings , they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings .
45015028	When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected , I will leave for Spain by way of you .
45015029	I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ .
45015030	I appeal to you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf ,
45015031	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea , and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ,
45015032	so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company .
45015033	May the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	I commend to you our sister Phoebe , a servant of the church at Cenchreae ,
45016002	that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints , and help her in whatever she may need from you , for she has been a patron of many and of myself as well .
45016003	Greet Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	who risked their necks for my life , to whom not only I give thanks but all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks as well .
45016005	Greet also the church in their house . Greet my beloved Epaenetus , who was the first convert to Christ in Asia .
45016006	Greet Mary , who has worked hard for you .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners . They are well known to the apostles , and they were in Christ before me .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus , my beloved in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and my beloved Stachys .
45016010	Greet Apelles , who is approved in Christ . Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet my kinsman Herodion . Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of Narcissus .
45016012	Greet those workers in the Lord , Tryphaena and Tryphosa . Greet the beloved Persis , who has worked hard in the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , chosen in the Lord ; also his mother , who has been a mother to me as well .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers who are with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ greet you .
45016017	I appeal to you , brothers , to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught ; avoid them .
45016018	For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ , but their own appetites , and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive .
45016019	For your obedience is known to all , so that I rejoice over you , but I want you to be wise as to what is good and innocent as to what is evil .
45016020	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , greets you ; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my kinsmen .
45016022	I Tertius , who wrote this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , who is host to me and to the whole church , greets you . Erastus , the city treasurer , and our brother Quartus , greet you .
45016025	Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages
45016026	but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations , according to the command of the eternal God , to bring about the obedience of faith —
45016027	to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ ! Amen .
46001001	Paul , called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and our brother Sosthenes ,
46001002	To the church of God that is in Corinth , to those sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , both their Lord and ours :
46001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus ,
46001005	that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge —
46001006	even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you —
46001007	so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift , as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
46001008	who will sustain you to the end , guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful , by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	I appeal to you , brothers , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree , and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment .
46001011	For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there is quarreling among you , my brothers .
46001012	What I mean is that each one of you says , “ I follow Paul , ” or “ I follow Apollos , ” or “ I follow Cephas , ” or “ I follow Christ . ”
46001013	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name .
46001016	( I did baptize also the household of Stephanas . Beyond that , I do not know whether I baptized anyone else .
46001017	For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel , and not with words of eloquent wisdom , lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power .
46001018	For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
46001019	For it is written , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart . ”
46001020	Where is the one who is wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the debater of this age ? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
46001021	For since , in the wisdom of God , the world did not know God through wisdom , it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe .
46001022	For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom ,
46001023	but we preach Christ crucified , a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles ,
46001024	but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
46001026	For consider your calling , brothers : not many of you were wise according to worldly standards , not many were powerful , not many were of noble birth .
46001027	But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise ; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong ;
46001028	God chose what is low and despised in the world , even things that are not , to bring to nothing things that are ,
46001029	so that no human being might boast in the presence of God .
46001030	And because of him you are in Christ Jesus , who became to us wisdom from God , righteousness and sanctification and redemption ,
46001031	so that , as it is written , “ Let the one who boasts , boast in the Lord . ”
46002001	And I , when I came to you , brothers , did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom .
46002002	For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified .
46002003	And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling ,
46002004	and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
46002005	that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God .
46002006	Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom , although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age , who are doomed to pass away .
46002007	But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God , which God decreed before the ages for our glory .
46002008	None of the rulers of this age understood this , for if they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But , as it is written , “ What no eye has seen , nor ear heard , nor the heart of man imagined , what God has prepared for those who love him ” —
46002010	these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit . For the Spirit searches everything , even the depths of God .
46002011	For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person , which is in him ? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
46002012	Now we have received not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , that we might understand the things freely given us by God .
46002013	And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit , interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual .
46002014	The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God , for they are folly to him , and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned .
46002015	The spiritual person judges all things , but is himself to be judged by no one .
46002016	“ For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him ? ” But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	But I , brothers , could not address you as spiritual people , but as people of the flesh , as infants in Christ .
46003002	I fed you with milk , not solid food , for you were not ready for it . And even now you are not yet ready ,
46003003	for you are still of the flesh . For while there is jealousy and strife among you , are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way ?
46003004	For when one says , “ I follow Paul , ” and another , “ I follow Apollos , ” are you not being merely human ?
46003005	What then is Apollos ? What is Paul ? Servants through whom you believed , as the Lord assigned to each .
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God gave the growth .
46003007	So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything , but only God who gives the growth .
46003008	He who plants and he who waters are one , and each will receive his wages according to his labor .
46003009	For we are God’s fellow workers . You are God’s field , God’s building .
46003010	According to the grace of God given to me , like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation , and someone else is building upon it . Let each one take care how he builds upon it .
46003011	For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw —
46003013	each one’s work will become manifest , for the Day will disclose it , because it will be revealed by fire , and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done .
46003014	If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives , he will receive a reward .
46003015	If anyone’s work is burned up , he will suffer loss , though he himself will be saved , but only as through fire .
46003016	Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you ?
46003017	If anyone destroys God’s temple , God will destroy him . For God’s temple is holy , and you are that temple .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age , let him become a fool that he may become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is folly with God . For it is written , “ He catches the wise in their craftiness , ”
46003020	and again , “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are futile . ”
46003021	So let no one boast in men . For all things are yours ,
46003022	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future — all are yours ,
46003023	and you are Christ’s , and Christ is God’s .
46004001	This is how one should regard us , as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God .
46004002	Moreover , it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy .
46004003	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court . In fact , I do not even judge myself .
46004004	For I am not aware of anything against myself , but I am not thereby acquitted . It is the Lord who judges me .
46004005	Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time , before the Lord comes , who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart . Then each one will receive his commendation from God .
46004006	I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit , brothers , that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written , that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another .
46004007	For who sees anything different in you ? What do you have that you did not receive ? If then you received it , why do you boast as if you did not receive it ?
46004008	Already you have all you want ! Already you have become rich ! Without us you have become kings ! And would that you did reign , so that we might share the rule with you !
46004009	For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all , like men sentenced to death , because we have become a spectacle to the world , to angels , and to men .
46004010	We are fools for Christ’s sake , but you are wise in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong . You are held in honor , but we in disrepute .
46004011	To the present hour we hunger and thirst , we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless ,
46004012	and we labor , working with our own hands . When reviled , we bless ; when persecuted , we endure ;
46004013	when slandered , we entreat . We have become , and are still , like the scum of the world , the refuse of all things .
46004014	I do not write these things to make you ashamed , but to admonish you as my beloved children .
46004015	For though you have countless guides in Christ , you do not have many fathers . For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel .
46004016	I urge you , then , be imitators of me .
46004017	That is why I sent you Timothy , my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , to remind you of my ways in Christ , as I teach them everywhere in every church .
46004018	Some are arrogant , as though I were not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you soon , if the Lord wills , and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power .
46004021	What do you wish ? Shall I come to you with a rod , or with love in a spirit of gentleness ?
46005001	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans , for a man has his father’s wife .
46005002	And you are arrogant ! Ought you not rather to mourn ? Let him who has done this be removed from among you .
46005003	For though absent in body , I am present in spirit ; and as if present , I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing .
46005004	When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present , with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord .
46005006	Your boasting is not good . Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump ?
46005007	Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump , as you really are unleavened . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
46005008	Let us therefore celebrate the festival , not with the old leaven , the leaven of malice and evil , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people —
46005010	not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world , or the greedy and swindlers , or idolaters , since then you would need to go out of the world .
46005011	But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed , or is an idolater , reviler , drunkard , or swindler — not even to eat with such a one .
46005012	For what have I to do with judging outsiders ? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge ?
46005013	God judges those outside . “ Purge the evil person from among you . ”
46006001	When one of you has a grievance against another , does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints ?
46006002	Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is to be judged by you , are you incompetent to try trivial cases ?
46006003	Do you not know that we are to judge angels ? How much more , then , matters pertaining to this life !
46006004	So if you have such cases , why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church ?
46006005	I say this to your shame . Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers ,
46006006	but brother goes to law against brother , and that before unbelievers ?
46006007	To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you . Why not rather suffer wrong ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
46006008	But you yourselves wrong and defraud — even your own brothers !
46006009	Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived : neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor men who practice homosexuality ,
46006010	nor thieves , nor the greedy , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	And such were some of you . But you were washed , you were sanctified , you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God .
46006012	“ All things are lawful for me , ” but not all things are helpful . “ All things are lawful for me , ” but I will not be enslaved by anything .
46006013	“ Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food ” — and God will destroy both one and the other . The body is not meant for sexual immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
46006014	And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? Never !
46006016	Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her ? For , as it is written , “ The two will become one flesh . ”
46006017	But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him .
46006018	Flee from sexual immorality . Every other sin a person commits is outside the body , but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body .
46006019	Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you , whom you have from God ? You are not your own ,
46006020	for you were bought with a price . So glorify God in your body .
46007001	Now concerning the matters about which you wrote : “ It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman . ”
46007002	But because of the temptation to sexual immorality , each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband .
46007003	The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights , and likewise the wife to her husband .
46007004	For the wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does . Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
46007005	Do not deprive one another , except perhaps by agreement for a limited time , that you may devote yourselves to prayer ; but then come together again , so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	Now as a concession , not a command , I say this .
46007007	I wish that all were as I myself am . But each has his own gift from God , one of one kind and one of another .
46007008	To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am .
46007009	But if they cannot exercise self-control , they should marry . For it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
46007010	To the married I give this charge ( not I , but the Lord ) : the wife should not separate from her husband
46007011	( but if she does , she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and the husband should not divorce his wife .
46007012	To the rest I say ( I , not the Lord
46007013	If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever , and he consents to live with her , she should not divorce him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife , and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but as it is , they are holy .
46007015	But if the unbelieving partner separates , let it be so . In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved . God has called you to peace .
46007016	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46007017	Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him , and to which God has called him . This is my rule in all the churches .
46007018	Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised ? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision . Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised ? Let him not seek circumcision .
46007019	For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision , but keeping the commandments of God .
46007020	Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called .
46007021	Were you a slave when called ? Do not be concerned about it . ( But if you can gain your freedom , avail yourself of the opportunity .
46007022	For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord . Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ .
46007023	You were bought with a price ; do not become slaves of men .
46007024	So , brothers , in whatever condition each was called , there let him remain with God .
46007025	Now concerning the betrothed , I have no command from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy .
46007026	I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be free . Are you free from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
46007028	But if you do marry , you have not sinned , and if a betrothed woman marries , she has not sinned . Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles , and I would spare you that .
46007029	This is what I mean , brothers : the appointed time has grown very short . From now on , let those who have wives live as though they had none ,
46007030	and those who mourn as though they were not mourning , and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing , and those who buy as though they had no goods ,
46007031	and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it . For the present form of this world is passing away .
46007032	I want you to be free from anxieties . The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord , how to please the Lord .
46007033	But the married man is anxious about worldly things , how to please his wife ,
46007034	and his interests are divided . And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord , how to be holy in body and spirit . But the married woman is anxious about worldly things , how to please her husband .
46007035	I say this for your own benefit , not to lay any restraint upon you , but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord .
46007036	If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed , if his passions are strong , and it has to be , let him do as he wishes : let them marry — it is no sin .
46007037	But whoever is firmly established in his heart , being under no necessity but having his desire under control , and has determined this in his heart , to keep her as his betrothed , he will do well .
46007038	So then he who marries his betrothed does well , and he who refrains from marriage will do even better .
46007039	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to be married to whom she wishes , only in the Lord .
46007040	Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is . And I think that I too have the Spirit of God .
46008001	Now concerning food offered to idols : we know that “ all of us possess knowledge . ” This “ knowledge ” puffs up , but love builds up .
46008002	If anyone imagines that he knows something , he does not yet know as he ought to know .
46008003	But if anyone loves God , he is known by God .
46008004	Therefore , as to the eating of food offered to idols , we know that “ an idol has no real existence , ” and that “ there is no God but one . ”
46008005	For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth — as indeed there are many “ gods ” and many “ lords ” —
46008006	yet for us there is one God , the Father , from whom are all things and for whom we exist , and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things and through whom we exist .
46008007	However , not all possess this knowledge . But some , through former association with idols , eat food as really offered to an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
46008008	Food will not commend us to God . We are no worse off if we do not eat , and no better off if we do .
46008009	But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak .
46008010	For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s temple , will he not be encouraged , if his conscience is weak , to eat food offered to idols ?
46008011	And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed , the brother for whom Christ died .
46008012	Thus , sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak , you sin against Christ .
46008013	Therefore , if food makes my brother stumble , I will never eat meat , lest I make my brother stumble .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are not you my workmanship in the Lord ?
46009002	If to others I am not an apostle , at least I am to you , for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	This is my defense to those who would examine me .
46009004	Do we not have the right to eat and drink ?
46009005	Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife , as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas ?
46009006	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living ?
46009007	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit ? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk ?
46009008	Do I say these things on human authority ? Does not the Law say the same ?
46009009	For it is written in the Law of Moses , “ You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain . ” Is it for oxen that God is concerned ?
46009010	Does he not speak entirely for our sake ? It was written for our sake , because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop .
46009011	If we have sown spiritual things among you , is it too much if we reap material things from you ?
46009012	If others share this rightful claim on you , do not we even more ? Nevertheless , we have not made use of this right , but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ .
46009013	Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple , and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings ?
46009014	In the same way , the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel .
46009015	But I have made no use of any of these rights , nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision . For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting .
46009016	For if I preach the gospel , that gives me no ground for boasting . For necessity is laid upon me . Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel !
46009017	For if I do this of my own will , I have a reward , but if not of my own will , I am still entrusted with a stewardship .
46009018	What then is my reward ? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge , so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel .
46009019	For though I am free from all , I have made myself a servant to all , that I might win more of them .
46009020	To the Jews I became as a Jew , in order to win Jews . To those under the law I became as one under the law ( though not being myself under the law
46009021	To those outside the law I became as one outside the law ( not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ
46009022	To the weak I became weak , that I might win the weak . I have become all things to all people , that by all means I might save some .
46009023	I do it all for the sake of the gospel , that I may share with them in its blessings .
46009024	Do you not know that in a race all the runners run , but only one receives the prize ? So run that you may obtain it .
46009025	Every athlete exercises self-control in all things . They do it to receive a perishable wreath , but we an imperishable .
46009026	So I do not run aimlessly ; I do not box as one beating the air .
46009027	But I discipline my body and keep it under control , lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified .
46010001	For I want you to know , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ,
46010002	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ,
46010003	and all ate the same spiritual food ,
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them , and the Rock was Christ .
46010005	Nevertheless , with most of them God was not pleased , for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
46010006	Now these things took place as examples for us , that we might not desire evil as they did .
46010007	Do not be idolaters as some of them were ; as it is written , “ The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play . ”
46010008	We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did , and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day .
46010009	We must not put Christ to the test , as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents ,
46010010	nor grumble , as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer .
46010011	Now these things happened to them as an example , but they were written down for our instruction , on whom the end of the ages has come .
46010012	Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall .
46010013	No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man . God is faithful , and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability , but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape , that you may be able to endure it .
46010014	Therefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry .
46010015	I speak as to sensible people ; judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	The cup of blessing that we bless , is it not a participation in the blood of Christ ? The bread that we break , is it not a participation in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Because there is one bread , we who are many are one body , for we all partake of the one bread .
46010018	Consider the people of Israel : are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar ?
46010019	What do I imply then ? That food offered to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
46010020	No , I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God . I do not want you to be participants with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
46010022	Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ?
46010023	“ All things are lawful , ” but not all things are helpful . “ All things are lawful , ” but not all things build up .
46010024	Let no one seek his own good , but the good of his neighbor .
46010025	Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience .
46010026	For “ the earth is the Lord’s , and the fullness thereof . ”
46010027	If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go , eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience .
46010028	But if someone says to you , “ This has been offered in sacrifice , ” then do not eat it , for the sake of the one who informed you , and for the sake of conscience —
46010029	I do not mean your conscience , but his . For why should my liberty be determined by someone else’s conscience ?
46010030	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks ?
46010031	So , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
46010032	Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God ,
46010033	just as I try to please everyone in everything I do , not seeking my own advantage , but that of many , that they may be saved .
46011001	Be imitators of me , as I am of Christ .
46011002	Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you .
46011003	But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ , the head of a wife is her husband , and the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head ,
46011005	but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head , since it is the same as if her head were shaven .
46011006	For if a wife will not cover her head , then she should cut her hair short . But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head , let her cover her head .
46011007	For a man ought not to cover his head , since he is the image and glory of God , but woman is the glory of man .
46011008	For man was not made from woman , but woman from man .
46011009	Neither was man created for woman , but woman for man .
46011010	That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
46011011	Nevertheless , in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman ;
46011012	for as woman was made from man , so man is now born of woman . And all things are from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves : is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him ,
46011015	but if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? For her hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	If anyone is inclined to be contentious , we have no such practice , nor do the churches of God .
46011017	But in the following instructions I do not commend you , because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse .
46011018	For , in the first place , when you come together as a church , I hear that there are divisions among you . And I believe it in part ,
46011019	for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized .
46011020	When you come together , it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat .
46011021	For in eating , each one goes ahead with his own meal . One goes hungry , another gets drunk .
46011022	What ! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I commend you in this ? No , I will not .
46011023	For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you , that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread ,
46011024	and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and said , “ This is my body which is for you . Do this in remembrance of me . ”
46011025	In the same way also he took the cup , after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of me . ”
46011026	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes .
46011027	Whoever , therefore , eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	Let a person examine himself , then , and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
46011029	For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself .
46011030	That is why many of you are weak and ill , and some have died .
46011031	But if we judged ourselves truly , we would not be judged .
46011032	But when we are judged by the Lord , we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world .
46011033	So then , my brothers , when you come together to eat , wait for one another —
46011034	if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home — so that when you come together it will not be for judgment . About the other things I will give directions when I come .
46012001	Now concerning spiritual gifts , brothers , I do not want you to be uninformed .
46012002	You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols , however you were led .
46012003	Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “ Jesus is accursed ! ” and no one can say “ Jesus is Lord ” except in the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Now there are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit ;
46012005	and there are varieties of service , but the same Lord ;
46012006	and there are varieties of activities , but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone .
46012007	To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good .
46012008	For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom , and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit ,
46012009	to another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit ,
46012010	to another the working of miracles , to another prophecy , to another the ability to distinguish between spirits , to another various kinds of tongues , to another the interpretation of tongues .
46012011	All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit , who apportions to each one individually as he wills .
46012012	For just as the body is one and has many members , and all the members of the body , though many , are one body , so it is with Christ .
46012013	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body — Jews or Greeks , slaves or free — and all were made to drink of one Spirit .
46012014	For the body does not consist of one member but of many .
46012015	If the foot should say , “ Because I am not a hand , I do not belong to the body , ” that would not make it any less a part of the body .
46012016	And if the ear should say , “ Because I am not an eye , I do not belong to the body , ” that would not make it any less a part of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where would be the sense of hearing ? If the whole body were an ear , where would be the sense of smell ?
46012018	But as it is , God arranged the members in the body , each one of them , as he chose .
46012019	If all were a single member , where would the body be ?
46012020	As it is , there are many parts , yet one body .
46012021	The eye cannot say to the hand , “ I have no need of you , ” nor again the head to the feet , “ I have no need of you . ”
46012022	On the contrary , the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable ,
46012023	and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor , and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty ,
46012024	which our more presentable parts do not require . But God has so composed the body , giving greater honor to the part that lacked it ,
46012025	that there may be no division in the body , but that the members may have the same care for one another .
46012026	If one member suffers , all suffer together ; if one member is honored , all rejoice together .
46012027	Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it .
46012028	And God has appointed in the church first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , then gifts of healing , helping , administrating , and various kinds of tongues .
46012029	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Do all work miracles ?
46012030	Do all possess gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	But earnestly desire the higher gifts . And I will show you a still more excellent way .
46013001	If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	And if I have prophetic powers , and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
46013003	If I give away all I have , and if I deliver up my body to be burned , but have not love , I gain nothing .
46013004	Love is patient and kind ; love does not envy or boast ; it is not arrogant
46013005	or rude . It does not insist on its own way ; it is not irritable or resentful ;
46013006	it does not rejoice at wrongdoing , but rejoices with the truth .
46013007	Love bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
46013008	Love never ends . As for prophecies , they will pass away ; as for tongues , they will cease ; as for knowledge , it will pass away .
46013009	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ,
46013010	but when the perfect comes , the partial will pass away .
46013011	When I was a child , I spoke like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I gave up childish ways .
46013012	For now we see in a mirror dimly , but then face to face . Now I know in part ; then I shall know fully , even as I have been fully known .
46013013	So now faith , hope , and love abide , these three ; but the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Pursue love , and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts , especially that you may prophesy .
46014002	For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God ; for no one understands him , but he utters mysteries in the Spirit .
46014003	On the other hand , the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation .
46014004	The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself , but the one who prophesies builds up the church .
46014005	Now I want you all to speak in tongues , but even more to prophesy . The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues , unless someone interprets , so that the church may be built up .
46014006	Now , brothers , if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching ?
46014007	If even lifeless instruments , such as the flute or the harp , do not give distinct notes , how will anyone know what is played ?
46014008	And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound , who will get ready for battle ?
46014009	So with yourselves , if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible , how will anyone know what is said ? For you will be speaking into the air .
46014010	There are doubtless many different languages in the world , and none is without meaning ,
46014011	but if I do not know the meaning of the language , I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me .
46014012	So with yourselves , since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit , strive to excel in building up the church .
46014013	Therefore , one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret .
46014014	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful .
46014015	What am I to do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will pray with my mind also ; I will sing praise with my spirit , but I will sing with my mind also .
46014016	Otherwise , if you give thanks with your spirit , how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “ Amen ” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying ?
46014017	For you may be giving thanks well enough , but the other person is not being built up .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you .
46014019	Nevertheless , in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others , than ten thousand words in a tongue .
46014020	Brothers , do not be children in your thinking . Be infants in evil , but in your thinking be mature .
46014021	In the Law it is written , “ By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people , and even then they will not listen to me , says the Lord . ”
46014022	Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers , while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers .
46014023	If , therefore , the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues , and outsiders or unbelievers enter , will they not say that you are out of your minds ?
46014024	But if all prophesy , and an unbeliever or outsider enters , he is convicted by all , he is called to account by all ,
46014025	the secrets of his heart are disclosed , and so , falling on his face , he will worship God and declare that God is really among you .
46014026	What then , brothers ? When you come together , each one has a hymn , a lesson , a revelation , a tongue , or an interpretation . Let all things be done for building up .
46014027	If any speak in a tongue , let there be only two or at most three , and each in turn , and let someone interpret .
46014028	But if there is no one to interpret , let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God .
46014029	Let two or three prophets speak , and let the others weigh what is said .
46014030	If a revelation is made to another sitting there , let the first be silent .
46014031	For you can all prophesy one by one , so that all may learn and all be encouraged ,
46014032	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets .
46014033	For God is not a God of confusion but of peace . As in all the churches of the saints ,
46014034	the women should keep silent in the churches . For they are not permitted to speak , but should be in submission , as the Law also says .
46014035	If there is anything they desire to learn , let them ask their husbands at home . For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church .
46014036	Or was it from you that the word of God came ? Or are you the only ones it has reached ?
46014037	If anyone thinks that he is a prophet , or spiritual , he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord .
46014038	If anyone does not recognize this , he is not recognized .
46014039	So , my brothers , earnestly desire to prophesy , and do not forbid speaking in tongues .
46014040	But all things should be done decently and in order .
46015001	Now I would remind you , brothers , of the gospel I preached to you , which you received , in which you stand ,
46015002	and by which you are being saved , if you hold fast to the word I preached to you — unless you believed in vain .
46015003	For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received : that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures ,
46015004	that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures ,
46015005	and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
46015006	Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time , most of whom are still alive , though some have fallen asleep .
46015007	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
46015008	Last of all , as to one untimely born , he appeared also to me .
46015009	For I am the least of the apostles , unworthy to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace toward me was not in vain . On the contrary , I worked harder than any of them , though it was not I , but the grace of God that is with me .
46015011	Whether then it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed .
46015012	Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead , how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , then not even Christ has been raised .
46015014	And if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain .
46015015	We are even found to be misrepresenting God , because we testified about God that he raised Christ , whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , not even Christ has been raised .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is futile and you are still in your sins .
46015018	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
46015019	If in Christ we have hope in this life only , we are of all people most to be pitied .
46015020	But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep .
46015021	For as by a man came death , by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead .
46015022	For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ shall all be made alive .
46015023	But each in his own order : Christ the firstfruits , then at his coming those who belong to Christ .
46015024	Then comes the end , when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power .
46015025	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be destroyed is death .
46015027	For “ God has put all things in subjection under his feet . ” But when it says , “ all things are put in subjection , ” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him .
46015028	When all things are subjected to him , then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him , that God may be all in all .
46015029	Otherwise , what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people baptized on their behalf ?
46015030	Why are we in danger every hour ?
46015031	I protest , brothers , by my pride in you , which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die every day !
46015032	What do I gain if , humanly speaking , I fought with beasts at Ephesus ? If the dead are not raised , “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . ”
46015033	Do not be deceived : “ Bad company ruins good morals . ”
46015034	Wake up from your drunken stupor , as is right , and do not go on sinning . For some have no knowledge of God . I say this to your shame .
46015035	But someone will ask , “ How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body do they come ? ”
46015036	You foolish person ! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
46015037	And what you sow is not the body that is to be , but a bare kernel , perhaps of wheat or of some other grain .
46015038	But God gives it a body as he has chosen , and to each kind of seed its own body .
46015039	For not all flesh is the same , but there is one kind for humans , another for animals , another for birds , and another for fish .
46015040	There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind , and the glory of the earthly is of another .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for star differs from star in glory .
46015042	So is it with the resurrection of the dead . What is sown is perishable ; what is raised is imperishable .
46015043	It is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
46015044	It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	Thus it is written , “ The first man Adam became a living being ” ; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
46015046	But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural , and then the spiritual .
46015047	The first man was from the earth , a man of dust ; the second man is from heaven .
46015048	As was the man of dust , so also are those who are of the dust , and as is the man of heaven , so also are those who are of heaven .
46015049	Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust , we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven .
46015050	I tell you this , brothers : flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God , nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable .
46015051	Behold ! I tell you a mystery . We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we shall be changed .
46015053	For this perishable body must put on the imperishable , and this mortal body must put on immortality .
46015054	When the perishable puts on the imperishable , and the mortal puts on immortality , then shall come to pass the saying that is written : “ Death is swallowed up in victory . ”
46015055	“ O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ”
46015056	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	Therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain .
46016001	Now concerning the collection for the saints : as I directed the churches of Galatia , so you also are to do .
46016002	On the first day of every week , each of you is to put something aside and store it up , as he may prosper , so that there will be no collecting when I come .
46016003	And when I arrive , I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	If it seems advisable that I should go also , they will accompany me .
46016005	I will visit you after passing through Macedonia , for I intend to pass through Macedonia ,
46016006	and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter , so that you may help me on my journey , wherever I go .
46016007	For I do not want to see you now just in passing . I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord permits .
46016008	But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	for a wide door for effective work has opened to me , and there are many adversaries .
46016010	When Timothy comes , see that you put him at ease among you , for he is doing the work of the Lord , as I am .
46016011	So let no one despise him . Help him on his way in peace , that he may return to me , for I am expecting him with the brothers .
46016012	Now concerning our brother Apollos , I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers , but it was not at all his will to come now . He will come when he has opportunity .
46016013	Be watchful , stand firm in the faith , act like men , be strong .
46016014	Let all that you do be done in love .
46016015	Now I urge you , brothers — you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia , and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints —
46016016	be subject to such as these , and to every fellow worker and laborer .
46016017	I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus , because they have made up for your absence ,
46016018	for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours . Give recognition to such men .
46016019	The churches of Asia send you greetings . Aquila and Prisca , together with the church in their house , send you hearty greetings in the Lord .
46016020	All the brothers send you greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand .
46016022	If anyone has no love for the Lord , let him be accursed . Our Lord , come !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
47001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , To the church of God that is at Corinth , with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia :
47001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ,
47001004	who comforts us in all our affliction , so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction , with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
47001005	For as we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings , so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too .
47001006	If we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation ; and if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer .
47001007	Our hope for you is unshaken , for we know that as you share in our sufferings , you will also share in our comfort .
47001008	For we do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , of the affliction we experienced in Asia . For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself .
47001009	Indeed , we felt that we had received the sentence of death . But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead .
47001010	He delivered us from such a deadly peril , and he will deliver us . On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again .
47001011	You also must help us by prayer , so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many .
47001012	For our boast is this , the testimony of our conscience , that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity , not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God , and supremely so toward you .
47001013	For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will fully acknowledge —
47001014	just as you did partially acknowledge us — that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you .
47001015	Because I was sure of this , I wanted to come to you first , so that you might have a second experience of grace .
47001016	I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia , and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea .
47001017	Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this ? Do I make my plans according to the flesh , ready to say “ Yes , yes ” and “ No , no ” at the same time ?
47001018	As surely as God is faithful , our word to you has not been Yes and No .
47001019	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , whom we proclaimed among you , Silvanus and Timothy and I , was not Yes and No , but in him it is always Yes .
47001020	For all the promises of God find their Yes in him . That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory .
47001021	And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ , and has anointed us ,
47001022	and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee .
47001023	But I call God to witness against me — it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth .
47001024	Not that we lord it over your faith , but we work with you for your joy , for you stand firm in your faith .
47002001	For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you .
47002002	For if I cause you pain , who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained ?
47002003	And I wrote as I did , so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice , for I felt sure of all of you , that my joy would be the joy of you all .
47002004	For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears , not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you .
47002005	Now if anyone has caused pain , he has caused it not to me , but in some measure — not to put it too severely — to all of you .
47002006	For such a one , this punishment by the majority is enough ,
47002007	so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him , or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
47002008	So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him .
47002009	For this is why I wrote , that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything .
47002010	Anyone whom you forgive , I also forgive . Indeed , what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , has been for your sake in the presence of Christ ,
47002011	so that we would not be outwitted by Satan ; for we are not ignorant of his designs .
47002012	When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ , even though a door was opened for me in the Lord ,
47002013	my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession , and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere .
47002015	For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing ,
47002016	to one a fragrance from death to death , to the other a fragrance from life to life . Who is sufficient for these things ?
47002017	For we are not , like so many , peddlers of God’s word , but as men of sincerity , as commissioned by God , in the sight of God we speak in Christ .
47003001	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? Or do we need , as some do , letters of recommendation to you , or from you ?
47003002	You yourselves are our letter of recommendation , written on our hearts , to be known and read by all .
47003003	And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
47003004	Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God .
47003005	Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us , but our sufficiency is from God ,
47003006	who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant , not of the letter but of the Spirit . For the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	Now if the ministry of death , carved in letters on stone , came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses ’ face because of its glory , which was being brought to an end ,
47003008	will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory ?
47003009	For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation , the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory .
47003010	Indeed , in this case , what once had glory has come to have no glory at all , because of the glory that surpasses it .
47003011	For if what was being brought to an end came with glory , much more will what is permanent have glory .
47003012	Since we have such a hope , we are very bold ,
47003013	not like Moses , who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end .
47003014	But their minds were hardened . For to this day , when they read the old covenant , that same veil remains unlifted , because only through Christ is it taken away .
47003015	Yes , to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts .
47003016	But when one turns to the Lord , the veil is removed .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
47003018	And we all , with unveiled face , beholding the glory of the Lord , are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another . For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit .
47004001	Therefore , having this ministry by the mercy of God , we do not lose heart .
47004002	But we have renounced disgraceful , underhanded ways . We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God’s word , but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God .
47004003	And even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing .
47004004	In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers , to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
47004005	For what we proclaim is not ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , with ourselves as your servants for Jesus ’ sake .
47004006	For God , who said , “ Let light shine out of darkness , ” has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in jars of clay , to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us .
47004008	We are afflicted in every way , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not driven to despair ;
47004009	persecuted , but not forsaken ; struck down , but not destroyed ;
47004010	always carrying in the body the death of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies .
47004011	For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus ’ sake , so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh .
47004012	So death is at work in us , but life in you .
47004013	Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written , “ I believed , and so I spoke , ” we also believe , and so we also speak ,
47004014	knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence .
47004015	For it is all for your sake , so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving , to the glory of God .
47004016	So we do not lose heart . Though our outer self is wasting away , our inner self is being renewed day by day .
47004017	For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison ,
47004018	as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen . For the things that are seen are transient , but the things that are unseen are eternal .
47005001	For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
47005002	For in this tent we groan , longing to put on our heavenly dwelling ,
47005003	if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked .
47005004	For while we are still in this tent , we groan , being burdened — not that we would be unclothed , but that we would be further clothed , so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
47005005	He who has prepared us for this very thing is God , who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee .
47005006	So we are always of good courage . We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord ,
47005007	for we walk by faith , not by sight .
47005008	Yes , we are of good courage , and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord .
47005009	So whether we are at home or away , we make it our aim to please him .
47005010	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body , whether good or evil .
47005011	Therefore , knowing the fear of the Lord , we persuade others . But what we are is known to God , and I hope it is known also to your conscience .
47005012	We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us , so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart .
47005013	For if we are beside ourselves , it is for God ; if we are in our right mind , it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Christ controls us , because we have concluded this : that one has died for all , therefore all have died ;
47005015	and he died for all , that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised .
47005016	From now on , therefore , we regard no one according to the flesh . Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh , we regard him thus no longer .
47005017	Therefore , if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation . The old has passed away ; behold , the new has come .
47005018	All this is from God , who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation ;
47005019	that is , in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself , not counting their trespasses against them , and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation .
47005020	Therefore , we are ambassadors for Christ , God making his appeal through us . We implore you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
47005021	For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin , so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
47006001	Working together with him , then , we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain .
47006002	For he says , “ In a favorable time I listened to you , and in a day of salvation I have helped you . ” Behold , now is the favorable time ; behold , now is the day of salvation .
47006003	We put no obstacle in anyone’s way , so that no fault may be found with our ministry ,
47006004	but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way : by great endurance , in afflictions , hardships , calamities ,
47006005	beatings , imprisonments , riots , labors , sleepless nights , hunger ;
47006006	by purity , knowledge , patience , kindness , the Holy Spirit , genuine love ;
47006007	by truthful speech , and the power of God ; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left ;
47006008	through honor and dishonor , through slander and praise . We are treated as impostors , and yet are true ;
47006009	as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and behold , we live ; as punished , and yet not killed ;
47006010	as sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , yet possessing everything .
47006011	We have spoken freely to you , Corinthians ; our heart is wide open .
47006012	You are not restricted by us , but you are restricted in your own affections .
47006013	In return ( I speak as to children
47006014	Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers . For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness ? Or what fellowship has light with darkness ?
47006015	What accord has Christ with Belial ? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever ?
47006016	What agreement has the temple of God with idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ; as God said , “ I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them , and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
47006017	Therefore go out from their midst , and be separate from them , says the Lord , and touch no unclean thing ; then I will welcome you ,
47006018	and I will be a father to you , and you shall be sons and daughters to me , says the Lord Almighty . ”
47007001	Since we have these promises , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit , bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God .
47007002	Make room in your hearts for us . We have wronged no one , we have corrupted no one , we have taken advantage of no one .
47007003	I do not say this to condemn you , for I said before that you are in our hearts , to die together and to live together .
47007004	I am acting with great boldness toward you ; I have great pride in you ; I am filled with comfort . In all our affliction , I am overflowing with joy .
47007005	For even when we came into Macedonia , our bodies had no rest , but we were afflicted at every turn — fighting without and fear within .
47007006	But God , who comforts the downcast , comforted us by the coming of Titus ,
47007007	and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you , as he told us of your longing , your mourning , your zeal for me , so that I rejoiced still more .
47007008	For even if I made you grieve with my letter , I do not regret it — though I did regret it , for I see that that letter grieved you , though only for a while .
47007009	As it is , I rejoice , not because you were grieved , but because you were grieved into repenting . For you felt a godly grief , so that you suffered no loss through us .
47007010	For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret , whereas worldly grief produces death .
47007011	For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you , but also what eagerness to clear yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , what punishment ! At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter .
47007012	So although I wrote to you , it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong , nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong , but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God .
47007013	Therefore we are comforted . And besides our own comfort , we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus , because his spirit has been refreshed by you all .
47007014	For whatever boasts I made to him about you , I was not put to shame . But just as everything we said to you was true , so also our boasting before Titus has proved true .
47007015	And his affection for you is even greater , as he remembers the obedience of you all , how you received him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I rejoice , because I have perfect confidence in you .
47008001	We want you to know , brothers , about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia ,
47008002	for in a severe test of affliction , their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part .
47008003	For they gave according to their means , as I can testify , and beyond their means , of their own accord ,
47008004	begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints —
47008005	and this , not as we expected , but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us .
47008006	Accordingly , we urged Titus that as he had started , so he should complete among you this act of grace .
47008007	But as you excel in everything — in faith , in speech , in knowledge , in all earnestness , and in our love for you — see that you excel in this act of grace also .
47008008	I say this not as a command , but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich , yet for your sake he became poor , so that you by his poverty might become rich .
47008010	And in this matter I give my judgment : this benefits you , who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it .
47008011	So now finish doing it as well , so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have .
47008012	For if the readiness is there , it is acceptable according to what a person has , not according to what he does not have .
47008013	For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened , but that as a matter of fairness
47008014	your abundance at the present time should supply their need , so that their abundance may supply your need , that there may be fairness .
47008015	As it is written , “ Whoever gathered much had nothing left over , and whoever gathered little had no lack . ”
47008016	But thanks be to God , who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you .
47008017	For he not only accepted our appeal , but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord .
47008018	With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel .
47008019	And not only that , but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of grace that is being ministered by us , for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will .
47008020	We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us ,
47008021	for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord’s sight but also in the sight of man .
47008022	And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters , but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit . And as for our brothers , they are messengers of the churches , the glory of Christ .
47008024	So give proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you to these men .
47009001	Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints ,
47009002	for I know your readiness , of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia , saying that Achaia has been ready since last year . And your zeal has stirred up most of them .
47009003	But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter , so that you may be ready , as I said you would be .
47009004	Otherwise , if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready , we would be humiliated — to say nothing of you — for being so confident .
47009005	So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised , so that it may be ready as a willing gift , not as an exaction .
47009006	The point is this : whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
47009007	Each one must give as he has decided in his heart , not reluctantly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	And God is able to make all grace abound to you , so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times , you may abound in every good work .
47009009	As it is written , “ He has distributed freely , he has given to the poor ; his righteousness endures forever . ”
47009010	He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness .
47009011	You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way , which through us will produce thanksgiving to God .
47009012	For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God .
47009013	By their approval of this service , they will glorify God because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ , and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others ,
47009014	while they long for you and pray for you , because of the surpassing grace of God upon you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift !
47010001	I , Paul , myself entreat you , by the meekness and gentleness of Christ — I who am humble when face to face with you , but bold toward you when I am away ! —
47010002	I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh .
47010003	For though we walk in the flesh , we are not waging war according to the flesh .
47010004	For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds .
47010005	We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God , and take every thought captive to obey Christ ,
47010006	being ready to punish every disobedience , when your obedience is complete .
47010007	Look at what is before your eyes . If anyone is confident that he is Christ’s , let him remind himself that just as he is Christ’s , so also are we .
47010008	For even if I boast a little too much of our authority , which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you , I will not be ashamed .
47010009	I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters .
47010010	For they say , “ His letters are weighty and strong , but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech of no account . ”
47010011	Let such a person understand that what we say by letter when absent , we do when present .
47010012	Not that we dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves . But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another , they are without understanding .
47010013	But we will not boast beyond limits , but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us , to reach even to you .
47010014	For we are not overextending ourselves , as though we did not reach you . For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ .
47010015	We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others . But our hope is that as your faith increases , our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged ,
47010016	so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you , without boasting of work already done in another’s area of influence .
47010017	“ Let the one who boasts , boast in the Lord . ”
47010018	For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved , but the one whom the Lord commends .
47011001	I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness . Do bear with me !
47011002	For I feel a divine jealousy for you , since I betrothed you to one husband , to present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
47011003	But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning , your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ .
47011004	For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed , or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received , or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted , you put up with it readily enough .
47011005	Indeed , I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles .
47011006	Even if I am unskilled in speaking , I am not so in knowledge ; indeed , in every way we have made this plain to you in all things .
47011007	Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted , because I preached God’s gospel to you free of charge ?
47011008	I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you .
47011009	And when I was with you and was in need , I did not burden anyone , for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need . So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way .
47011010	As the truth of Christ is in me , this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia .
47011011	And why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
47011012	And what I do I will continue to do , in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do .
47011013	For such men are false apostles , deceitful workmen , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no wonder , for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light .
47011015	So it is no surprise if his servants , also , disguise themselves as servants of righteousness . Their end will correspond to their deeds .
47011016	I repeat , let no one think me foolish . But even if you do , accept me as a fool , so that I too may boast a little .
47011017	What I am saying with this boastful confidence , I say not with the Lord’s authority but as a fool .
47011018	Since many boast according to the flesh , I too will boast .
47011019	For you gladly bear with fools , being wise yourselves !
47011020	For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you , or devours you , or takes advantage of you , or puts on airs , or strikes you in the face .
47011021	To my shame , I must say , we were too weak for that ! But whatever anyone else dares to boast of — I am speaking as a fool — I also dare to boast of that .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they offspring of Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? I am a better one — I am talking like a madman — with far greater labors , far more imprisonments , with countless beatings , and often near death .
47011024	Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with rods . Once I was stoned . Three times I was shipwrecked ; a night and a day I was adrift at sea ;
47011026	on frequent journeys , in danger from rivers , danger from robbers , danger from my own people , danger from Gentiles , danger in the city , danger in the wilderness , danger at sea , danger from false brothers ;
47011027	in toil and hardship , through many a sleepless night , in hunger and thirst , often without food , in cold and exposure .
47011028	And , apart from other things , there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is made to fall , and I am not indignant ?
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast of the things that show my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , he who is blessed forever , knows that I am not lying .
47011032	At Damascus , the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me ,
47011033	but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands .
47012001	I must go on boasting . Though there is nothing to be gained by it , I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , God knows .
47012003	And I know that this man was caught up into paradise — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , God knows —
47012004	and he heard things that cannot be told , which man may not utter .
47012005	On behalf of this man I will boast , but on my own behalf I will not boast , except of my weaknesses .
47012006	Though if I should wish to boast , I would not be a fool , for I would be speaking the truth . But I refrain from it , so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me .
47012007	So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations , a thorn was given me in the flesh , a messenger of Satan to harass me , to keep me from becoming conceited .
47012008	Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this , that it should leave me .
47012009	But he said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . ” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
47012010	For the sake of Christ , then , I am content with weaknesses , insults , hardships , persecutions , and calamities . For when I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I have been a fool ! You forced me to it , for I ought to have been commended by you . For I was not at all inferior to these super-apostles , even though I am nothing .
47012012	The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience , with signs and wonders and mighty works .
47012013	For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches , except that I myself did not burden you ? Forgive me this wrong !
47012014	Here for the third time I am ready to come to you . And I will not be a burden , for I seek not what is yours but you . For children are not obligated to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
47012015	I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . If I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
47012016	But granting that I myself did not burden you , I was crafty , you say , and got the better of you by deceit .
47012017	Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you ?
47012018	I urged Titus to go , and sent the brother with him . Did Titus take advantage of you ? Did we not act in the same spirit ? Did we not take the same steps ?
47012019	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you ? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ , and all for your upbuilding , beloved .
47012020	For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish , and that you may find me not as you wish — that perhaps there may be quarreling , jealousy , anger , hostility , slander , gossip , conceit , and disorder .
47012021	I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you , and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity , sexual immorality , and sensuality that they have practiced .
47013001	This is the third time I am coming to you . Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses .
47013002	I warned those who sinned before and all the others , and I warn them now while absent , as I did when present on my second visit , that if I come again I will not spare them —
47013003	since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me . He is not weak in dealing with you , but is powerful among you .
47013004	For he was crucified in weakness , but lives by the power of God . For we also are weak in him , but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God .
47013005	Examine yourselves , to see whether you are in the faith . Test yourselves . Or do you not realize this about yourselves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? — unless indeed you fail to meet the test !
47013006	I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test .
47013007	But we pray to God that you may not do wrong — not that we may appear to have met the test , but that you may do what is right , though we may seem to have failed .
47013008	For we cannot do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
47013009	For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong . Your restoration is what we pray for .
47013010	For this reason I write these things while I am away from you , that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down .
47013011	Finally , brothers , rejoice . Aim for restoration , comfort one another , agree with one another , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All the saints greet you .
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	Paul , an apostle — not from men nor through man , but through Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised him from the dead —
48001002	and all the brothers who are with me , To the churches of Galatia :
48001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father ,
48001005	to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel —
48001007	not that there is another one , but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ .
48001008	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you , let him be accursed .
48001009	As we have said before , so now I say again : If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received , let him be accursed .
48001010	For am I now seeking the approval of man , or of God ? Or am I trying to please man ? If I were still trying to please man , I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	For I would have you know , brothers , that the gospel that was preached by me is not man’s gospel .
48001012	For I did not receive it from any man , nor was I taught it , but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ .
48001013	For you have heard of my former life in Judaism , how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it .
48001014	And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people , so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers .
48001015	But when he who had set me apart before I was born , and who called me by his grace ,
48001016	was pleased to reveal his Son to me , in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles , I did not immediately consult with anyone ;
48001017	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia , and returned again to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days .
48001019	But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord’s brother .
48001020	( In what I am writing to you , before God , I do not lie !
48001021	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ .
48001023	They only were hearing it said , “ He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy . ”
48001024	And they glorified God because of me .
48002001	Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus along with me .
48002002	I went up because of a revelation and set before them ( though privately before those who seemed influential
48002003	But even Titus , who was with me , was not forced to be circumcised , though he was a Greek .
48002004	Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in — who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus , so that they might bring us into slavery —
48002005	to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you .
48002006	And from those who seemed to be influential ( what they were makes no difference to me ; God shows no partiality ) — those , I say , who seemed influential added nothing to me .
48002007	On the contrary , when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised , just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised
48002008	( for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles ) ,
48002009	and when James and Cephas and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given to me , they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me , that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised .
48002010	Only , they asked us to remember the poor , the very thing I was eager to do .
48002011	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he stood condemned .
48002012	For before certain men came from James , he was eating with the Gentiles ; but when they came he drew back and separated himself , fearing the circumcision party .
48002013	And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him , so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas before them all , “ If you , though a Jew , live like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews ? ”
48002015	We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners ;
48002016	yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ , so we also have believed in Christ Jesus , in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law , because by works of the law no one will be justified .
48002017	But if , in our endeavor to be justified in Christ , we too were found to be sinners , is Christ then a servant of sin ? Certainly not !
48002018	For if I rebuild what I tore down , I prove myself to be a transgressor .
48002019	For through the law I died to the law , so that I might live to God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ . It is no longer I who live , but Christ who lives in me . And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me .
48002021	I do not nullify the grace of God , for if righteousness were through the law , then Christ died for no purpose .
48003001	O foolish Galatians ! Who has bewitched you ? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified .
48003002	Let me ask you only this : Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? Having begun by the Spirit , are you now being perfected by the flesh ?
48003004	Did you suffer so many things in vain — if indeed it was in vain ?
48003005	Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law , or by hearing with faith —
48003006	just as Abraham “ believed God , and it was counted to him as righteousness ” ?
48003007	Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham .
48003008	And the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham , saying , “ In you shall all the nations be blessed . ”
48003009	So then , those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham , the man of faith .
48003010	For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse ; for it is written , “ Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law , and do them . ”
48003011	Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law , for “ The righteous shall live by faith . ”
48003012	But the law is not of faith , rather “ The one who does them shall live by them . ”
48003013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — for it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree ” —
48003014	so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles , so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith .
48003015	To give a human example , brothers : even with a man-made covenant , no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified .
48003016	Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring . It does not say , “ And to offsprings , ” referring to many , but referring to one , “ And to your offspring , ” who is Christ .
48003017	This is what I mean : the law , which came 430 years afterward , does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God , so as to make the promise void .
48003018	For if the inheritance comes by the law , it no longer comes by promise ; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise .
48003019	Why then the law ? It was added because of transgressions , until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made , and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary .
48003020	Now an intermediary implies more than one , but God is one .
48003021	Is the law then contrary to the promises of God ? Certainly not ! For if a law had been given that could give life , then righteousness would indeed be by the law .
48003022	But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin , so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
48003023	Now before faith came , we were held captive under the law , imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed .
48003024	So then , the law was our guardian until Christ came , in order that we might be justified by faith .
48003025	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a guardian ,
48003026	for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God , through faith .
48003027	For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is no male and female , for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	And if you are Christ’s , then you are Abraham’s offspring , heirs according to promise .
48004001	I mean that the heir , as long as he is a child , is no different from a slave , though he is the owner of everything ,
48004002	but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father .
48004003	In the same way we also , when we were children , were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world .
48004004	But when the fullness of time had come , God sent forth his Son , born of woman , born under the law ,
48004005	to redeem those who were under the law , so that we might receive adoption as sons .
48004006	And because you are sons , God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
48004007	So you are no longer a slave , but a son , and if a son , then an heir through God .
48004008	Formerly , when you did not know God , you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods .
48004009	But now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world , whose slaves you want to be once more ?
48004010	You observe days and months and seasons and years !
48004011	I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain .
48004012	Brothers , I entreat you , become as I am , for I also have become as you are . You did me no wrong .
48004013	You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first ,
48004014	and though my condition was a trial to you , you did not scorn or despise me , but received me as an angel of God , as Christ Jesus .
48004015	What then has become of the blessing you felt ? For I testify to you that , if possible , you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me .
48004016	Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	They make much of you , but for no good purpose . They want to shut you out , that you may make much of them .
48004018	It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose , and not only when I am present with you ,
48004019	my little children , for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you !
48004020	I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone , for I am perplexed about you .
48004021	Tell me , you who desire to be under the law , do you not listen to the law ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by a slave woman and one by a free woman .
48004023	But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh , while the son of the free woman was born through promise .
48004024	Now this may be interpreted allegorically : these women are two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai , bearing children for slavery ; she is Hagar .
48004025	Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia ; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem above is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written , “ Rejoice , O barren one who does not bear ; break forth and cry aloud , you who are not in labor ! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband . ”
48004028	Now you , brothers , like Isaac , are children of promise .
48004029	But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so also it is now .
48004030	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Cast out the slave woman and her son , for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman . ”
48004031	So , brothers , we are not children of the slave but of the free woman .
48005001	For freedom Christ has set us free ; stand firm therefore , and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery .
48005002	Look : I , Paul , say to you that if you accept circumcision , Christ will be of no advantage to you .
48005003	I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law .
48005004	You are severed from Christ , you who would be justified by the law ; you have fallen away from grace .
48005005	For through the Spirit , by faith , we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness .
48005006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything , but only faith working through love .
48005007	You were running well . Who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	This persuasion is not from him who calls you .
48005009	A little leaven leavens the whole lump .
48005010	I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine , and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty , whoever he is .
48005011	But if I , brothers , still preach circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed .
48005012	I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves !
48005013	For you were called to freedom , brothers . Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh , but through love serve one another .
48005014	For the whole law is fulfilled in one word : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ”
48005015	But if you bite and devour one another , watch out that you are not consumed by one another .
48005016	But I say , walk by the Spirit , and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit , and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh , for these are opposed to each other , to keep you from doing the things you want to do .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
48005019	Now the works of the flesh are evident : sexual immorality , impurity , sensuality ,
48005020	idolatry , sorcery , enmity , strife , jealousy , fits of anger , rivalries , dissensions , divisions ,
48005021	envy , drunkenness , orgies , and things like these . I warn you , as I warned you before , that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , self-control ; against such things there is no law .
48005024	And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
48005025	If we live by the Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become conceited , provoking one another , envying one another .
48006001	Brothers , if anyone is caught in any transgression , you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness . Keep watch on yourself , lest you too be tempted .
48006002	Bear one another’s burdens , and so fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	For if anyone thinks he is something , when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
48006004	But let each one test his own work , and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor .
48006005	For each will have to bear his own load .
48006006	One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches .
48006007	Do not be deceived : God is not mocked , for whatever one sows , that will he also reap .
48006008	For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption , but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
48006009	And let us not grow weary of doing good , for in due season we will reap , if we do not give up .
48006010	So then , as we have opportunity , let us do good to everyone , and especially to those who are of the household of faith .
48006011	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand .
48006012	It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised , and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48006013	For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law , but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh .
48006014	But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
48006015	For neither circumcision counts for anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
48006016	And as for all who walk by this rule , peace and mercy be upon them , and upon the Israel of God .
48006017	From now on let no one cause me trouble , for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers . Amen .
49001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , To the saints who are in Ephesus , and are faithful in Christ Jesus :
49001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places ,
49001004	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and blameless before him . In love
49001005	he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ , according to the purpose of his will ,
49001006	to the praise of his glorious grace , with which he has blessed us in the Beloved .
49001007	In him we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
49001008	which he lavished upon us , in all wisdom and insight
49001009	making known to us the mystery of his will , according to his purpose , which he set forth in Christ
49001010	as a plan for the fullness of time , to unite all things in him , things in heaven and things on earth .
49001011	In him we have obtained an inheritance , having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will ,
49001012	so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory .
49001013	In him you also , when you heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation , and believed in him , were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit ,
49001014	who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it , to the praise of his glory .
49001015	For this reason , because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints ,
49001016	I do not cease to give thanks for you , remembering you in my prayers ,
49001017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him ,
49001018	having the eyes of your hearts enlightened , that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you , what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints ,
49001019	and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe , according to the working of his great might
49001020	that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places ,
49001021	far above all rule and authority and power and dominion , and above every name that is named , not only in this age but also in the one to come .
49001022	And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church ,
49001023	which is his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all .
49002001	And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
49002002	in which you once walked , following the course of this world , following the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience —
49002003	among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh , carrying out the desires of the body and the mind , and were by nature children of wrath , like the rest of mankind .
49002004	But God , being rich in mercy , because of the great love with which he loved us ,
49002005	even when we were dead in our trespasses , made us alive together with Christ — by grace you have been saved —
49002006	and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
49002007	so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For by grace you have been saved through faith . And this is not your own doing ; it is the gift of God ,
49002009	not a result of works , so that no one may boast .
49002010	For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared beforehand , that we should walk in them .
49002011	Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh , called “ the uncircumcision ” by what is called the circumcision , which is made in the flesh by hands —
49002012	remember that you were at that time separated from Christ , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he himself is our peace , who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
49002015	by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances , that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two , so making peace ,
49002016	and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross , thereby killing the hostility .
49002017	And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near .
49002018	For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father .
49002019	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens , but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God ,
49002020	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone ,
49002021	in whom the whole structure , being joined together , grows into a holy temple in the Lord .
49002022	In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit .
49003001	For this reason I , Paul , a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles —
49003002	assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you ,
49003003	how the mystery was made known to me by revelation , as I have written briefly .
49003004	When you read this , you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ ,
49003005	which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit .
49003006	This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs , members of the same body , and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel .
49003007	Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace , which was given me by the working of his power .
49003008	To me , though I am the very least of all the saints , this grace was given , to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
49003009	and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things ,
49003010	so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places .
49003011	This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
49003012	in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him .
49003013	So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you , which is your glory .
49003014	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father ,
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named ,
49003016	that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being ,
49003017	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith — that you , being rooted and grounded in love ,
49003018	may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth ,
49003019	and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge , that you may be filled with all the fullness of God .
49003020	Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think , according to the power at work within us ,
49003021	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations , forever and ever . Amen .
49004001	I therefore , a prisoner for the Lord , urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called ,
49004002	with all humility and gentleness , with patience , bearing with one another in love ,
49004003	eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit — just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call —
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
49004007	But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ’s gift .
49004008	Therefore it says , “ When he ascended on high he led a host of captives , and he gave gifts to men . ”
49004009	( In saying , “ He ascended , ” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions , the earth ?
49004010	He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
49004011	And he gave the apostles , the prophets , the evangelists , the shepherds and teachers ,
49004012	to equip the saints for the work of ministry , for building up the body of Christ ,
49004013	until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to mature manhood , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ,
49004014	so that we may no longer be children , tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine , by human cunning , by craftiness in deceitful schemes .
49004015	Rather , speaking the truth in love , we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head , into Christ ,
49004016	from whom the whole body , joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped , when each part is working properly , makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love .
49004017	Now this I say and testify in the Lord , that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do , in the futility of their minds .
49004018	They are darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them , due to their hardness of heart .
49004019	They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality , greedy to practice every kind of impurity .
49004020	But that is not the way you learned Christ ! —
49004021	assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him , as the truth is in Jesus ,
49004022	to put off your old self , which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires ,
49004023	and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds ,
49004024	and to put on the new self , created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness .
49004025	Therefore , having put away falsehood , let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor , for we are members one of another .
49004026	Be angry and do not sin ; do not let the sun go down on your anger ,
49004027	and give no opportunity to the devil .
49004028	Let the thief no longer steal , but rather let him labor , doing honest work with his own hands , so that he may have something to share with anyone in need .
49004029	Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths , but only such as is good for building up , as fits the occasion , that it may give grace to those who hear .
49004030	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you , along with all malice .
49004032	Be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , as God in Christ forgave you .
49005001	Therefore be imitators of God , as beloved children .
49005002	And walk in love , as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us , a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God .
49005003	But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you , as is proper among saints .
49005004	Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking , which are out of place , but instead let there be thanksgiving .
49005005	For you may be sure of this , that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure , or who is covetous ( that is , an idolater ) , has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
49005006	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience .
49005007	Therefore do not become partners with them ;
49005008	for at one time you were darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Walk as children of light
49005009	( for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true ) ,
49005010	and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord .
49005011	Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness , but instead expose them .
49005012	For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret .
49005013	But when anything is exposed by the light , it becomes visible ,
49005014	for anything that becomes visible is light . Therefore it says , “ Awake , O sleeper , and arise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . ”
49005015	Look carefully then how you walk , not as unwise but as wise ,
49005016	making the best use of the time , because the days are evil .
49005017	Therefore do not be foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
49005018	And do not get drunk with wine , for that is debauchery , but be filled with the Spirit ,
49005019	addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart ,
49005020	giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
49005021	submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ .
49005022	Wives , submit to your own husbands , as to the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church , his body , and is himself its Savior .
49005024	Now as the church submits to Christ , so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her ,
49005026	that he might sanctify her , having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word ,
49005027	so that he might present the church to himself in splendor , without spot or wrinkle or any such thing , that she might be holy and without blemish .
49005028	In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	For no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as Christ does the church ,
49005030	because we are members of his body .
49005031	“ Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh . ”
49005032	This mystery is profound , and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church .
49005033	However , let each one of you love his wife as himself , and let the wife see that she respects her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right .
49006002	“ Honor your father and mother ” ( this is the first commandment with a promise ) ,
49006003	“ that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land . ”
49006004	Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling , with a sincere heart , as you would Christ ,
49006006	not by the way of eye-service , as people-pleasers , but as servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ,
49006007	rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man ,
49006008	knowing that whatever good anyone does , this he will receive back from the Lord , whether he is a slave or free .
49006009	Masters , do the same to them , and stop your threatening , knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and that there is no partiality with him .
49006010	Finally , be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might .
49006011	Put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil .
49006012	For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the authorities , against the cosmic powers over this present darkness , against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places .
49006013	Therefore take up the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand firm .
49006014	Stand therefore , having fastened on the belt of truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
49006015	and , as shoes for your feet , having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace .
49006016	In all circumstances take up the shield of faith , with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one ;
49006017	and take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God ,
49006018	praying at all times in the Spirit , with all prayer and supplication . To that end keep alert with all perseverance , making supplication for all the saints ,
49006019	and also for me , that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel ,
49006020	for which I am an ambassador in chains , that I may declare it boldly , as I ought to speak .
49006021	So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing , Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will tell you everything .
49006022	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are , and that he may encourage your hearts .
49006023	Peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus , To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the overseersand deacons :
50001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you ,
50001004	always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy ,
50001005	because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now .
50001006	And I am sure of this , that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ .
50001007	It is right for me to feel this way about you all , because I hold you in my heart , for you are all partakers with me of grace , both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel .
50001008	For God is my witness , how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus .
50001009	And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more , with knowledge and all discernment ,
50001010	so that you may approve what is excellent , and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ ,
50001011	filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	I want you to know , brothers , that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel ,
50001013	so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ .
50001014	And most of the brothers , having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
50001015	Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry , but others from good will .
50001016	The latter do it out of love , knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel .
50001017	The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry , not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment .
50001018	What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed , and in that I rejoice . Yes , and I will rejoice ,
50001019	for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance ,
50001020	as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed , but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body , whether by life or by death .
50001021	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
50001022	If I am to live in the flesh , that means fruitful labor for me . Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell .
50001023	I am hard pressed between the two . My desire is to depart and be with Christ , for that is far better .
50001024	But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account .
50001025	Convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
50001026	so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus , because of my coming to you again .
50001027	Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit , with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel ,
50001028	and not frightened in anything by your opponents . This is a clear sign to them of their destruction , but of your salvation , and that from God .
50001029	For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake ,
50001030	engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have .
50002001	So if there is any encouragement in Christ , any comfort from love , any participation in the Spirit , any affection and sympathy ,
50002002	complete my joy by being of the same mind , having the same love , being in full accord and of one mind .
50002003	Do nothing from rivalry or conceit , but in humility count others more significant than yourselves .
50002004	Let each of you look not only to his own interests , but also to the interests of others .
50002005	Have this mind among yourselves , which is yours in Christ Jesus ,
50002006	who , though he was in the form of God , did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped ,
50002007	but made himself nothing , taking the form of a servant , being born in the likeness of men .
50002008	And being found in human form , he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death , even death on a cross .
50002009	Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name ,
50002010	so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
50002011	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	Therefore , my beloved , as you have always obeyed , so now , not only as in my presence but much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling ,
50002013	for it is God who works in you , both to will and to work for his good pleasure .
50002014	Do all things without grumbling or questioning ,
50002015	that you may be blameless and innocent , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation , among whom you shine as lights in the world ,
50002016	holding fast to the word of life , so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain .
50002017	Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith , I am glad and rejoice with you all .
50002018	Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me .
50002019	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , so that I too may be cheered by news of you .
50002020	For I have no one like him , who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare .
50002021	For they all seek their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ .
50002022	But you know Timothy’s proven worth , how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel .
50002023	I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me ,
50002024	and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also .
50002025	I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier , and your messenger and minister to my need ,
50002026	for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill .
50002027	Indeed he was ill , near to death . But God had mercy on him , and not only on him but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
50002028	I am the more eager to send him , therefore , that you may rejoice at seeing him again , and that I may be less anxious .
50002029	So receive him in the Lord with all joy , and honor such men ,
50002030	for he nearly died for the work of Christ , risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me .
50003001	Finally , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you .
50003002	Look out for the dogs , look out for the evildoers , look out for those who mutilate the flesh .
50003003	For we are the circumcision , who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh —
50003004	though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also . If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh , I have more :
50003005	circumcised on the eighth day , of the people of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; as to the law , a Pharisee ;
50003006	as to zeal , a persecutor of the church ; as to righteousness under the law , blameless .
50003007	But whatever gain I had , I counted as loss for the sake of Christ .
50003008	Indeed , I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish , in order that I may gain Christ
50003009	and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law , but that which comes through faith in Christ , the righteousness from God that depends on faith —
50003010	that I may know him and the power of his resurrection , and may share his sufferings , becoming like him in his death ,
50003011	that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead .
50003012	Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect , but I press on to make it my own , because Christ Jesus has made me his own .
50003013	Brothers , I do not consider that I have made it my own . But one thing I do : forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead ,
50003014	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Let those of us who are mature think this way , and if in anything you think otherwise , God will reveal that also to you .
50003016	Only let us hold true to what we have attained .
50003017	Brothers , join in imitating me , and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us .
50003018	For many , of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears , walk as enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	Their end is destruction , their god is their belly , and they glory in their shame , with minds set on earthly things .
50003020	But our citizenship is in heaven , and from it we await a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
50003021	who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body , by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself .
50004001	Therefore , my brothers , whom I love and long for , my joy and crown , stand firm thus in the Lord , my beloved .
50004002	I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , I ask you also , true companion , help these women , who have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I will say , Rejoice .
50004005	Let your reasonableness be known to everyone . The Lord is at hand ;
50004006	do not be anxious about anything , but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God .
50004007	And the peace of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Finally , brothers , whatever is true , whatever is honorable , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is commendable , if there is any excellence , if there is anything worthy of praise , think about these things .
50004009	What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me — practice these things , and the God of peace will be with you .
50004010	I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me . You were indeed concerned for me , but you had no opportunity .
50004011	Not that I am speaking of being in need , for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content .
50004012	I know how to be brought low , and I know how to abound . In any and every circumstance , I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger , abundance and need .
50004013	I can do all things through him who strengthens me .
50004014	Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble .
50004015	And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel , when I left Macedonia , no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving , except you only .
50004016	Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again .
50004017	Not that I seek the gift , but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit .
50004018	I have received full payment , and more . I am well supplied , having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent , a fragrant offering , a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God .
50004019	And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	To our God and Father be glory forever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus . The brothers who are with me greet you .
50004022	All the saints greet you , especially those of Caesar’s household .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
51001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God our Father .
51001003	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you ,
51001004	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints ,
51001005	because of the hope laid up for you in heaven . Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth , the gospel ,
51001006	which has come to you , as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing — as it also does among you , since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth ,
51001007	just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant . He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf
51001008	and has made known to us your love in the Spirit .
51001009	And so , from the day we heard , we have not ceased to pray for you , asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
51001010	so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord , fully pleasing to him , bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God .
51001011	May you be strengthened with all power , according to his glorious might , for all endurance and patience with joy ,
51001012	giving thanks to the Father , who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light .
51001013	He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins .
51001015	He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation .
51001016	For by him all things were created , in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities — all things were created through him and for him .
51001017	And he is before all things , and in him all things hold together .
51001018	And he is the head of the body , the church . He is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , that in everything he might be preeminent .
51001019	For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell ,
51001020	and through him to reconcile to himself all things , whether on earth or in heaven , making peace by the blood of his cross .
51001021	And you , who once were alienated and hostile in mind , doing evil deeds ,
51001022	he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death , in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him ,
51001023	if indeed you continue in the faith , stable and steadfast , not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard , which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven , and of which I , Paul , became a minister .
51001024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body , that is , the church ,
51001025	of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you , to make the word of God fully known ,
51001026	the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints .
51001027	To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory .
51001028	Him we proclaim , warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom , that we may present everyone mature in Christ .
51001029	For this I toil , struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me .
51002001	For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face ,
51002002	that their hearts may be encouraged , being knit together in love , to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God’s mystery , which is Christ ,
51002003	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments .
51002005	For though I am absent in body , yet I am with you in spirit , rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ .
51002006	Therefore , as you received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk in him ,
51002007	rooted and built up in him and established in the faith , just as you were taught , abounding in thanksgiving .
51002008	See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit , according to human tradition , according to the elemental spirits of the world , and not according to Christ .
51002009	For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily ,
51002010	and you have been filled in him , who is the head of all rule and authority .
51002011	In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands , by putting off the body of the flesh , by the circumcision of Christ ,
51002012	having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God , who raised him from the dead .
51002013	And you , who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh , God made alive together with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses ,
51002014	by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands . This he set aside , nailing it to the cross .
51002015	He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame , by triumphing over them in him .
51002016	Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink , or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath .
51002017	These are a shadow of the things to come , but the substance belongs to Christ .
51002018	Let no one disqualify you , insisting on asceticism and worship of angels , going on in detail about visions , puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind ,
51002019	and not holding fast to the Head , from whom the whole body , nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments , grows with a growth that is from God .
51002020	If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world , why , as if you were still alive in the world , do you submit to regulations —
51002021	“ Do not handle , Do not taste , Do not touch ”
51002022	( referring to things that all perish as they are used ) — according to human precepts and teachings ?
51002023	These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body , but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh .
51003001	If then you have been raised with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God .
51003002	Set your minds on things that are above , not on things that are on earth .
51003003	For you have died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ who is your life appears , then you also will appear with him in glory .
51003005	Put to death therefore what is earthly in you : sexual immorality , impurity , passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry .
51003006	On account of these the wrath of God is coming .
51003007	In these you too once walked , when you were living in them .
51003008	But now you must put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and obscene talk from your mouth .
51003009	Do not lie to one another , seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices
51003010	and have put on the new self , which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator .
51003011	Here there is not Greek and Jew , circumcised and uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave , free ; but Christ is all , and in all .
51003012	Put on then , as God’s chosen ones , holy and beloved , compassionate hearts , kindness , humility , meekness , and patience ,
51003013	bearing with one another and , if one has a complaint against another , forgiving each other ; as the Lord has forgiven you , so you also must forgive .
51003014	And above all these put on love , which binds everything together in perfect harmony .
51003015	And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts , to which indeed you were called in one body . And be thankful .
51003016	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly , teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom , singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
51003017	And whatever you do , in word or deed , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , submit to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives , and do not be harsh with them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this pleases the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not provoke your children , lest they become discouraged .
51003022	Slaves , obey in everything those who are your earthly masters , not by way of eye-service , as people-pleasers , but with sincerity of heart , fearing the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , work heartily , as for the Lord and not for men ,
51003024	knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward . You are serving the Lord Christ .
51003025	For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done , and there is no partiality .
51004001	Masters , treat your slaves justly and fairly , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Continue steadfastly in prayer , being watchful in it with thanksgiving .
51004003	At the same time , pray also for us , that God may open to us a door for the word , to declare the mystery of Christ , on account of which I am in prison —
51004004	that I may make it clear , which is how I ought to speak .
51004005	Walk in wisdom toward outsiders , making the best use of the time .
51004006	Let your speech always be gracious , seasoned with salt , so that you may know how you ought to answer each person .
51004007	Tychicus will tell you all about my activities . He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord .
51004008	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts ,
51004009	and with him Onesimus , our faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They will tell you of everything that has taken place here .
51004010	Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you , and Mark the cousin of Barnabas ( concerning whom you have received instructions — if he comes to you , welcome him ) ,
51004011	and Jesus who is called Justus . These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God , and they have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ Jesus , greets you , always struggling on your behalf in his prayers , that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God .
51004013	For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke the beloved physician greets you , as does Demas .
51004015	Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea , and to Nympha and the church in her house .
51004016	And when this letter has been read among you , have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans ; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea .
51004017	And say to Archippus , “ See that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord . ”
51004018	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . Remember my chains . Grace be with you .
52001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace .
52001002	We give thanks to God always for all of you , constantly mentioning you in our prayers ,
52001003	remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
52001004	For we know , brothers loved by God , that he has chosen you ,
52001005	because our gospel came to you not only in word , but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction . You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake .
52001006	And you became imitators of us and of the Lord , for you received the word in much affliction , with the joy of the Holy Spirit ,
52001007	so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia .
52001008	For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia , but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere , so that we need not say anything .
52001009	For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you , and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ,
52001010	and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brothers , that our coming to you was not in vain .
52002002	But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi , as you know , we had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict .
52002003	For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive ,
52002004	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel , so we speak , not to please man , but to please God who tests our hearts .
52002005	For we never came with words of flattery , as you know , nor with a pretext for greed — God is witness .
52002006	Nor did we seek glory from people , whether from you or from others , though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ .
52002007	But we were gentle among you , like a nursing mother taking care of her own children .
52002008	So , being affectionately desirous of you , we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves , because you had become very dear to us .
52002009	For you remember , brothers , our labor and toil : we worked night and day , that we might not be a burden to any of you , while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God .
52002010	You are witnesses , and God also , how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers .
52002011	For you know how , like a father with his children ,
52002012	we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God , who calls you into his own kingdom and glory .
52002013	And we also thank God constantly for this , that when you received the word of God , which you heard from us , you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is , the word of God , which is at work in you believers .
52002014	For you , brothers , became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea . For you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews ,
52002015	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove us out , and displease God and oppose all mankind
52002016	by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved — so as always to fill up the measure of their sins . But God’s wrath has come upon them at last !
52002017	But since we were torn away from you , brothers , for a short time , in person not in heart , we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face ,
52002018	because we wanted to come to you — I , Paul , again and again — but Satan hindered us .
52002019	For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming ? Is it not you ?
52002020	For you are our glory and joy .
52003001	Therefore when we could bear it no longer , we were willing to be left behind at Athens alone ,
52003002	and we sent Timothy , our brother and God’s coworker in the gospel of Christ , to establish and exhort you in your faith ,
52003003	that no one be moved by these afflictions . For you yourselves know that we are destined for this .
52003004	For when we were with you , we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction , just as it has come to pass , and just as you know .
52003005	For this reason , when I could bear it no longer , I sent to learn about your faith , for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain .
52003006	But now that Timothy has come to us from you , and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us , as we long to see you —
52003007	for this reason , brothers , in all our distress and affliction we have been comforted about you through your faith .
52003008	For now we live , if you are standing fast in the Lord .
52003009	For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you , for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God ,
52003010	as we pray most earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith ?
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus , direct our way to you ,
52003012	and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all , as we do for you ,
52003013	so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
52004001	Finally , then , brothers , we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus , that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God , just as you are doing , that you do so more and more .
52004002	For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is the will of God , your sanctification : that you abstain from sexual immorality ;
52004004	that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor ,
52004005	not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God ;
52004006	that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter , because the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you .
52004007	For God has not called us for impurity , but in holiness .
52004008	Therefore whoever disregards this , disregards not man but God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you .
52004009	Now concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you , for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another ,
52004010	for that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia . But we urge you , brothers , to do this more and more ,
52004011	and to aspire to live quietly , and to mind your own affairs , and to work with your hands , as we instructed you ,
52004012	so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one .
52004013	But we do not want you to be uninformed , brothers , about those who are asleep , that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope .
52004014	For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so , through Jesus , God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep .
52004015	For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will not precede those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command , with the voice of an archangel , and with the sound of the trumpet of God . And the dead in Christ will rise first .
52004017	Then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air , and so we will always be with the Lord .
52004018	Therefore encourage one another with these words .
52005001	Now concerning the times and the seasons , brothers , you have no need to have anything written to you .
52005002	For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .
52005003	While people are saying , “ There is peace and security , ” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman , and they will not escape .
52005004	But you are not in darkness , brothers , for that day to surprise you like a thief .
52005005	For you are all children of light , children of the day . We are not of the night or of the darkness .
52005006	So then let us not sleep , as others do , but let us keep awake and be sober .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep at night , and those who get drunk , are drunk at night .
52005008	But since we belong to the day , let us be sober , having put on the breastplate of faith and love , and for a helmet the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God has not destined us for wrath , but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52005010	who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him .
52005011	Therefore encourage one another and build one another up , just as you are doing .
52005012	We ask you , brothers , to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you ,
52005013	and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	And we urge you , brothers , admonish the idle , encourage the fainthearted , help the weak , be patient with them all .
52005015	See that no one repays anyone evil for evil , but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone .
52005016	Rejoice always ,
52005017	pray without ceasing ,
52005018	give thanks in all circumstances ; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you .
52005019	Do not quench the Spirit .
52005020	Do not despise prophecies ,
52005021	but test everything ; hold fast what is good .
52005022	Abstain from every form of evil .
52005023	Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely , and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	He who calls you is faithful ; he will surely do it .
52005025	Brothers , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss .
52005027	I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	We ought always to give thanks to God for you , brothers , as is right , because your faith is growing abundantly , and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing .
53001004	Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring .
53001005	This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God , that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you are also suffering —
53001006	since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
53001007	and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us , when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
53001008	in flaming fire , inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction , away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might ,
53001010	when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints , and to be marveled at among all who have believed , because our testimony to you was believed .
53001011	To this end we always pray for you , that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power ,
53001012	so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him , we ask you , brothers ,
53002002	not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed , either by a spirit or a spoken word , or a letter seeming to be from us , to the effect that the day of the Lord has come .
53002003	Let no one deceive you in any way . For that day will not come , unless the rebellion comes first , and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the son of destruction ,
53002004	who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship , so that he takes his seat in the temple of God , proclaiming himself to be God .
53002005	Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things ?
53002006	And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time .
53002007	For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work . Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way .
53002008	And then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming .
53002009	The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders ,
53002010	and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing , because they refused to love the truth and so be saved .
53002011	Therefore God sends them a strong delusion , so that they may believe what is false ,
53002012	in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
53002013	But we ought always to give thanks to God for you , brothers beloved by the Lord , because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved , through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth .
53002014	To this he called you through our gospel , so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So then , brothers , stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us , either by our spoken word or by our letter .
53002016	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God our Father , who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace ,
53002017	comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word .
53003001	Finally , brothers , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored , as happened among you ,
53003002	and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men . For not all have faith .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful . He will establish you and guard you against the evil one .
53003004	And we have confidence in the Lord about you , that you are doing and will do the things that we command .
53003005	May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ .
53003006	Now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us , because we were not idle when we were with you ,
53003008	nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it , but with toil and labor we worked night and day , that we might not be a burden to any of you .
53003009	It was not because we do not have that right , but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate .
53003010	For even when we were with you , we would give you this command : If anyone is not willing to work , let him not eat .
53003011	For we hear that some among you walk in idleness , not busy at work , but busybodies .
53003012	Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living .
53003013	As for you , brothers , do not grow weary in doing good .
53003014	If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter , take note of that person , and have nothing to do with him , that he may be ashamed .
53003015	Do not regard him as an enemy , but warn him as a brother .
53003016	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way . The Lord be with you all .
53003017	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . This is the sign of genuineness in every letter of mine ; it is the way I write .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope ,
54001002	To Timothy , my true child in the faith : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia , remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine ,
54001004	nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies , which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith .
54001005	The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .
54001006	Certain persons , by swerving from these , have wandered away into vain discussion ,
54001007	desiring to be teachers of the law , without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions .
54001008	Now we know that the law is good , if one uses it lawfully ,
54001009	understanding this , that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for those who strike their fathers and mothers , for murderers ,
54001010	the sexually immoral , men who practice homosexuality , enslavers , liars , perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine ,
54001011	in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted .
54001012	I thank him who has given me strength , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he judged me faithful , appointing me to his service ,
54001013	though formerly I was a blasphemer , persecutor , and insolent opponent . But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief ,
54001014	and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
54001015	The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am the foremost .
54001016	But I received mercy for this reason , that in me , as the foremost , Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life .
54001017	To the King of ages , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
54001018	This charge I entrust to you , Timothy , my child , in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you , that by them you may wage the good warfare ,
54001019	holding faith and a good conscience . By rejecting this , some have made shipwreck of their faith ,
54001020	among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme .
54002001	First of all , then , I urge that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be made for all people ,
54002002	for kings and all who are in high positions , that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life , godly and dignified in every way .
54002003	This is good , and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior ,
54002004	who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God , and there is one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a ransom for all , which is the testimony given at the proper time .
54002007	For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth , I am not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
54002008	I desire then that in every place the men should pray , lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling ;
54002009	likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel , with modesty and self-control , not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire ,
54002010	but with what is proper for women who profess godliness — with good works .
54002011	Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness .
54002012	I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man ; rather , she is to remain quiet .
54002013	For Adam was formed first , then Eve ;
54002014	and Adam was not deceived , but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor .
54002015	Yet she will be saved through childbearing — if they continue in faith and love and holiness , with self-control .
54003001	The saying is trustworthy : If anyone aspires to the office of overseer , he desires a noble task .
54003002	Therefore an overseer must be above reproach , the husband of one wife , sober-minded , self-controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach ,
54003003	not a drunkard , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money .
54003004	He must manage his own household well , with all dignity keeping his children submissive ,
54003005	for if someone does not know how to manage his own household , how will he care for God’s church ?
54003006	He must not be a recent convert , or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil .
54003007	Moreover , he must be well thought of by outsiders , so that he may not fall into disgrace , into a snare of the devil .
54003008	Deacons likewise must be dignified , not double-tongued , not addicted to much wine , not greedy for dishonest gain .
54003009	They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience .
54003010	And let them also be tested first ; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless .
54003011	Their wives likewise must be dignified , not slanderers , but sober-minded , faithful in all things .
54003012	Let deacons each be the husband of one wife , managing their children and their own households well .
54003013	For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I hope to come to you soon , but I am writing these things to you so that ,
54003015	if I delay , you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God , which is the church of the living God , a pillar and buttress of the truth .
54003016	Great indeed , we confess , is the mystery of godliness : He was manifested in the flesh , vindicated by the Spirit , seen by angels , proclaimed among the nations , believed on in the world , taken up in glory .
54004001	Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons ,
54004002	through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared ,
54004003	who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
54004004	For everything created by God is good , and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving ,
54004005	for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer .
54004006	If you put these things before the brothers , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed .
54004007	Have nothing to do with irreverent , silly myths . Rather train yourself for godliness ;
54004008	for while bodily training is of some value , godliness is of value in every way , as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come .
54004009	The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance .
54004010	For to this end we toil and strive , because we have our hope set on the living God , who is the Savior of all people , especially of those who believe .
54004011	Command and teach these things .
54004012	Let no one despise you for your youth , but set the believers an example in speech , in conduct , in love , in faith , in purity .
54004013	Until I come , devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture , to exhortation , to teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect the gift you have , which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you .
54004015	Practice these things , immerse yourself in them , so that all may see your progress .
54004016	Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching . Persist in this , for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers .
54005001	Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father , younger men as brothers ,
54005002	older women as mothers , younger women as sisters , in all purity .
54005003	Honor widows who are truly widows .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents , for this is pleasing in the sight of God .
54005005	She who is truly a widow , left all alone , has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day ,
54005006	but she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives .
54005007	Command these things as well , so that they may be without reproach .
54005008	But if anyone does not provide for his relatives , and especially for members of his household , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age , having been the wife of one husband ,
54005010	and having a reputation for good works : if she has brought up children , has shown hospitality , has washed the feet of the saints , has cared for the afflicted , and has devoted herself to every good work .
54005011	But refuse to enroll younger widows , for when their passions draw them away from Christ , they desire to marry
54005012	and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith .
54005013	Besides that , they learn to be idlers , going about from house to house , and not only idlers , but also gossips and busybodies , saying what they should not .
54005014	So I would have younger widows marry , bear children , manage their households , and give the adversary no occasion for slander .
54005015	For some have already strayed after Satan .
54005016	If any believing woman has relatives who are widows , let her care for them . Let the church not be burdened , so that it may care for those who are truly widows .
54005017	Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in preaching and teaching .
54005018	For the Scripture says , “ You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain , ” and , “ The laborer deserves his wages . ”
54005019	Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses .
54005020	As for those who persist in sin , rebuke them in the presence of all , so that the rest may stand in fear .
54005021	In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging , doing nothing from partiality .
54005022	Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands , nor take part in the sins of others ; keep yourself pure .
54005023	( No longer drink only water , but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments .
54005024	The sins of some men are conspicuous , going before them to judgment , but the sins of others appear later .
54005025	So also good works are conspicuous , and even those that are not cannot remain hidden .
54006001	Let all who are under a yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor , so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled .
54006002	Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brothers ; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved . Teach and urge these things .
54006003	If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness ,
54006004	he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing . He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words , which produce envy , dissension , slander , evil suspicions ,
54006005	and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth , imagining that godliness is a means of gain .
54006006	Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment ,
54006007	for we brought nothing into the world , and we cannot take anything out of the world .
54006008	But if we have food and clothing , with these we will be content .
54006009	But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation , into a snare , into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils . It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs .
54006011	But as for you , O man of God , flee these things . Pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , steadfastness , gentleness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of the faith . Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses .
54006013	I charge you in the presence of God , who gives life to all things , and of Christ Jesus , who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession ,
54006014	to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
54006015	which he will display at the proper time — he who is the blessed and only Sovereign , the King of kings and Lord of lords ,
54006016	who alone has immortality , who dwells in unapproachable light , whom no one has ever seen or can see . To him be honor and eternal dominion . Amen .
54006017	As for the rich in this present age , charge them not to be haughty , nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches , but on God , who richly provides us with everything to enjoy .
54006018	They are to do good , to be rich in good works , to be generous and ready to share ,
54006019	thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future , so that they may take hold of that which is truly life .
54006020	O Timothy , guard the deposit entrusted to you . Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called “ knowledge , ”
54006021	for by professing it some have swerved from the faith . Grace be with you .
55001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	To Timothy , my beloved child : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I thank God whom I serve , as did my ancestors , with a clear conscience , as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day .
55001004	As I remember your tears , I long to see you , that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	I am reminded of your sincere faith , a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now , I am sure , dwells in you as well .
55001006	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God , which is in you through the laying on of my hands ,
55001007	for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control .
55001008	Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord , nor of me his prisoner , but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God ,
55001009	who saved us and called us to a holy calling , not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace , which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began ,
55001010	and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus , who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel ,
55001011	for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher ,
55001012	which is why I suffer as I do . But I am not ashamed , for I know whom I have believed , and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me .
55001013	Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me , in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
55001014	By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us , guard the good deposit entrusted to you .
55001015	You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me , among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains ,
55001017	but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me earnestly and found me —
55001018	may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day ! — and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus .
55002001	You then , my child , be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus ,
55002002	and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also .
55002003	Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits , since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him .
55002005	An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules .
55002006	It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops .
55002007	Think over what I say , for the Lord will give you understanding in everything .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , the offspring of David , as preached in my gospel ,
55002009	for which I am suffering , bound with chains as a criminal . But the word of God is not bound !
55002010	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect , that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
55002011	The saying is trustworthy , for : If we have died with him , we will also live with him ;
55002012	if we endure , we will also reign with him ; if we deny him , he also will deny us ;
55002013	if we are faithless , he remains faithful — for he cannot deny himself .
55002014	Remind them of these things , and charge them before God not to quarrel about words , which does no good , but only ruins the hearers .
55002015	Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved , a worker who has no need to be ashamed , rightly handling the word of truth .
55002016	But avoid irreverent babble , for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness ,
55002017	and their talk will spread like gangrene . Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
55002018	who have swerved from the truth , saying that the resurrection has already happened . They are upsetting the faith of some .
55002019	But God’s firm foundation stands , bearing this seal : “ The Lord knows those who are his , ” and , “ Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity . ”
55002020	Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay , some for honorable use , some for dishonorable .
55002021	Therefore , if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable , he will be a vessel for honorable use , set apart as holy , useful to the master of the house , ready for every good work .
55002022	So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace , along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart .
55002023	Have nothing to do with foolish , ignorant controversies ; you know that they breed quarrels .
55002024	And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone , able to teach , patiently enduring evil ,
55002025	correcting his opponents with gentleness . God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth ,
55002026	and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil , after being captured by him to do his will .
55003001	But understand this , that in the last days there will come times of difficulty .
55003002	For people will be lovers of self , lovers of money , proud , arrogant , abusive , disobedient to their parents , ungrateful , unholy ,
55003003	heartless , unappeasable , slanderous , without self-control , brutal , not loving good ,
55003004	treacherous , reckless , swollen with conceit , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ,
55003005	having the appearance of godliness , but denying its power . Avoid such people .
55003006	For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women , burdened with sins and led astray by various passions ,
55003007	always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth .
55003008	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so these men also oppose the truth , men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith .
55003009	But they will not get very far , for their folly will be plain to all , as was that of those two men .
55003010	You , however , have followed my teaching , my conduct , my aim in life , my faith , my patience , my love , my steadfastness ,
55003011	my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch , at Iconium , and at Lystra — which persecutions I endured ; yet from them all the Lord rescued me .
55003012	Indeed , all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted ,
55003013	while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse , deceiving and being deceived .
55003014	But as for you , continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed , knowing from whom you learned it
55003015	and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings , which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness ,
55003017	that the man of God may be competent , equipped for every good work .
55004001	I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , who is to judge the living and the dead , and by his appearing and his kingdom :
55004002	preach the word ; be ready in season and out of season ; reprove , rebuke , and exhort , with complete patience and teaching .
55004003	For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching , but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions ,
55004004	and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths .
55004005	As for you , always be sober-minded , endure suffering , do the work of an evangelist , fulfill your ministry .
55004006	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering , and the time of my departure has come .
55004007	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
55004008	Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will award to me on that Day , and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing .
55004009	Do your best to come to me soon .
55004010	For Demas , in love with this present world , has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Luke alone is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , for he is very useful to me for ministry .
55004012	Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas , also the books , and above all the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm ; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds .
55004015	Beware of him yourself , for he strongly opposed our message .
55004016	At my first defense no one came to stand by me , but all deserted me . May it not be charged against them !
55004017	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me , so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it . So I was rescued from the lion’s mouth .
55004018	The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom . To him be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Greet Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus remained at Corinth , and I left Trophimus , who was ill , at Miletus .
55004021	Do your best to come before winter . Eubulus sends greetings to you , as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you .
56001001	Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ , for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth , which accords with godliness ,
56001002	in hope of eternal life , which God , who never lies , promised before the ages began
56001003	and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior ;
56001004	To Titus , my true child in a common faith : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior .
56001005	This is why I left you in Crete , so that you might put what remained into order , and appoint elders in every town as I directed you —
56001006	if anyone is above reproach , the husband of one wife , and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination .
56001007	For an overseer , as God’s steward , must be above reproach . He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain ,
56001008	but hospitable , a lover of good , self-controlled , upright , holy , and disciplined .
56001009	He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught , so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it .
56001010	For there are many who are insubordinate , empty talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision party .
56001011	They must be silenced , since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach .
56001012	One of the Cretans , a prophet of their own , said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons . ”
56001013	This testimony is true . Therefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,
56001014	not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth .
56001015	To the pure , all things are pure , but to the defiled and unbelieving , nothing is pure ; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled .
56001016	They profess to know God , but they deny him by their works . They are detestable , disobedient , unfit for any good work .
56002001	But as for you , teach what accords with sound doctrine .
56002002	Older men are to be sober-minded , dignified , self-controlled , sound in faith , in love , and in steadfastness .
56002003	Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior , not slanderers or slaves to much wine . They are to teach what is good ,
56002004	and so train the young women to love their husbands and children ,
56002005	to be self-controlled , pure , working at home , kind , and submissive to their own husbands , that the word of God may not be reviled .
56002006	Likewise , urge the younger men to be self-controlled .
56002007	Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works , and in your teaching show integrity , dignity ,
56002008	and sound speech that cannot be condemned , so that an opponent may be put to shame , having nothing evil to say about us .
56002009	Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything ; they are to be well-pleasing , not argumentative ,
56002010	not pilfering , but showing all good faith , so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior .
56002011	For the grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation for all people ,
56002012	training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions , and to live self-controlled , upright , and godly lives in the present age ,
56002013	waiting for our blessed hope , the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ ,
56002014	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works .
56002015	Declare these things ; exhort and rebuke with all authority . Let no one disregard you .
56003001	Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities , to be obedient , to be ready for every good work ,
56003002	to speak evil of no one , to avoid quarreling , to be gentle , and to show perfect courtesy toward all people .
56003003	For we ourselves were once foolish , disobedient , led astray , slaves to various passions and pleasures , passing our days in malice and envy , hated by others and hating one another .
56003004	But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared ,
56003005	he saved us , not because of works done by us in righteousness , but according to his own mercy , by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
56003007	so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
56003008	The saying is trustworthy , and I want you to insist on these things , so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works . These things are excellent and profitable for people .
56003009	But avoid foolish controversies , genealogies , dissensions , and quarrels about the law , for they are unprofitable and worthless .
56003010	As for a person who stirs up division , after warning him once and then twice , have nothing more to do with him ,
56003011	knowing that such a person is warped and sinful ; he is self-condemned .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way ; see that they lack nothing .
56003014	And let our people learn to devote themselves to good works , so as to help cases of urgent need , and not be unfruitful .
56003015	All who are with me send greetings to you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	Paul , a prisoner for Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
57001002	and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier , and the church in your house :
57001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers ,
57001005	because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints ,
57001006	and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ .
57001007	For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love , my brother , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you .
57001008	Accordingly , though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required ,
57001009	yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you — I , Paul , an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus —
57001010	I appeal to you for my child , Onesimus , whose father I became in my imprisonment .
57001011	( Formerly he was useless to you , but now he is indeed useful to you and to me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you , sending my very heart .
57001013	I would have been glad to keep him with me , in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel ,
57001014	but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord .
57001015	For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while , that you might have him back forever ,
57001016	no longer as a slave but more than a slave , as a beloved brother — especially to me , but how much more to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
57001017	So if you consider me your partner , receive him as you would receive me .
57001018	If he has wronged you at all , or owes you anything , charge that to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it — to say nothing of your owing me even your own self .
57001020	Yes , brother , I want some benefit from you in the Lord . Refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	Confident of your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even more than I say .
57001022	At the same time , prepare a guest room for me , for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends greetings to you ,
57001024	and so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
58001001	Long ago , at many times and in many ways , God spoke to our fathers by the prophets ,
58001002	but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed the heir of all things , through whom also he created the world .
58001003	He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature , and he upholds the universe by the word of his power . After making purification for sins , he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,
58001004	having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs .
58001005	For to which of the angels did God ever say , “ You are my Son , today I have begotten you ” ? Or again , “ I will be to him a father , and he shall be to me a son ” ?
58001006	And again , when he brings the firstborn into the world , he says , “ Let all God’s angels worship him . ”
58001007	Of the angels he says , “ He makes his angels winds , and his ministers a flame of fire . ”
58001008	But of the Son he says , “ Your throne , O God , is forever and ever , the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom .
58001009	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness ; therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions . ”
58001010	And , “ You , Lord , laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning , and the heavens are the work of your hands ;
58001011	they will perish , but you remain ; they will all wear out like a garment ,
58001012	like a robe you will roll them up , like a garment they will be changed . But you are the same , and your years will have no end . ”
58001013	And to which of the angels has he ever said , “ Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ” ?
58001014	Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation ?
58002001	Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard , lest we drift away from it .
58002002	For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable , and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution ,
58002003	how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation ? It was declared at first by the Lord , and it was attested to us by those who heard ,
58002004	while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will .
58002005	Now it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come , of which we are speaking .
58002006	It has been testified somewhere , “ What is man , that you are mindful of him , or the son of man , that you care for him ?
58002007	You made him for a little while lower than the angels ; you have crowned him with glory and honor ,
58002008	putting everything in subjection under his feet . ” Now in putting everything in subjection to him , he left nothing outside his control . At present , we do not yet see everything in subjection to him .
58002009	But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels , namely Jesus , crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death , so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone .
58002010	For it was fitting that he , for whom and by whom all things exist , in bringing many sons to glory , should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering .
58002011	For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source . That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
58002012	saying , “ I will tell of your name to my brothers ; in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise . ”
58002013	And again , “ I will put my trust in him . ” And again , “ Behold , I and the children God has given me . ”
58002014	Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood , he himself likewise partook of the same things , that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death , that is , the devil ,
58002015	and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery .
58002016	For surely it is not angels that he helps , but he helps the offspring of Abraham .
58002017	Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect , so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God , to make propitiation for the sins of the people .
58002018	For because he himself has suffered when tempted , he is able to help those who are being tempted .
58003001	Therefore , holy brothers , you who share in a heavenly calling , consider Jesus , the apostle and high priest of our confession ,
58003002	who was faithful to him who appointed him , just as Moses also was faithful in all God’s house .
58003003	For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses — as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself .
58003004	( For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God .
58003005	Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant , to testify to the things that were to be spoken later ,
58003006	but Christ is faithful over God’s house as a son . And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope .
58003007	Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says , “ Today , if you hear his voice ,
58003008	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion , on the day of testing in the wilderness ,
58003009	where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years .
58003010	Therefore I was provoked with that generation , and said , ‘ They always go astray in their heart ; they have not known my ways . ’
58003011	As I swore in my wrath , ‘ They shall not enter my rest . ’ ”
58003012	Take care , brothers , lest there be in any of you an evil , unbelieving heart , leading you to fall away from the living God .
58003013	But exhort one another every day , as long as it is called “ today , ” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
58003014	For we have come to share in Christ , if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end .
58003015	As it is said , “ Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion . ”
58003016	For who were those who heard and yet rebelled ? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses ?
58003017	And with whom was he provoked for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
58003018	And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest , but to those who were disobedient ?
58003019	So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief .
58004001	Therefore , while the promise of entering his rest still stands , let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it .
58004002	For good news came to us just as to them , but the message they heard did not benefit them , because they were not united by faith with those who listened .
58004003	For we who have believed enter that rest , as he has said , “ As I swore in my wrath , ‘ They shall not enter my rest , ’ ” although his works were finished from the foundation of the world .
58004004	For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works . ”
58004005	And again in this passage he said , “ They shall not enter my rest . ”
58004006	Since therefore it remains for some to enter it , and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience ,
58004007	again he appoints a certain day , “ Today , ” saying through David so long afterward , in the words already quoted , “ Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts . ”
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest , God would not have spoken of another day later on .
58004009	So then , there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God ,
58004010	for whoever has entered God’s rest has also rested from his works as God did from his .
58004011	Let us therefore strive to enter that rest , so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience .
58004012	For the word of God is living and active , sharper than any two-edged sword , piercing to the division of soul and of spirit , of joints and of marrow , and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart .
58004013	And no creature is hidden from his sight , but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account .
58004014	Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession .
58004015	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are , yet without sin .
58004016	Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need .
58005001	For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God , to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward , since he himself is beset with weakness .
58005003	Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people .
58005004	And no one takes this honor for himself , but only when called by God , just as Aaron was .
58005005	So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest , but was appointed by him who said to him , “ You are my Son , today I have begotten you ” ;
58005006	as he says also in another place , “ You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek . ”
58005007	In the days of his flesh , Jesus offered up prayers and supplications , with loud cries and tears , to him who was able to save him from death , and he was heard because of his reverence .
58005008	Although he was a son , he learned obedience through what he suffered .
58005009	And being made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him ,
58005010	being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	About this we have much to say , and it is hard to explain , since you have become dull of hearing .
58005012	For though by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God . You need milk , not solid food ,
58005013	for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness , since he is a child .
58005014	But solid food is for the mature , for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil .
58006001	Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity , not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God ,
58006002	and of instruction about washings , the laying on of hands , the resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .
58006003	And this we will do if God permits .
58006004	For it is impossible , in the case of those who have once been enlightened , who have tasted the heavenly gift , and have shared in the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come ,
58006006	and then have fallen away , to restore them again to repentance , since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt .
58006007	For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it , and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated , receives a blessing from God .
58006008	But if it bears thorns and thistles , it is worthless and near to being cursed , and its end is to be burned .
58006009	Though we speak in this way , yet in your case , beloved , we feel sure of better things — things that belong to salvation .
58006010	For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints , as you still do .
58006011	And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end ,
58006012	so that you may not be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
58006013	For when God made a promise to Abraham , since he had no one greater by whom to swear , he swore by himself ,
58006014	saying , “ Surely I will bless you and multiply you . ”
58006015	And thus Abraham , having patiently waited , obtained the promise .
58006016	For people swear by something greater than themselves , and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation .
58006017	So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose , he guaranteed it with an oath ,
58006018	so that by two unchangeable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us .
58006019	We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul , a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain ,
58006020	where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf , having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	For this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of the Most High God , met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
58007002	and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything . He is first , by translation of his name , king of righteousness , and then he is also king of Salem , that is , king of peace .
58007003	He is without father or mother or genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever .
58007004	See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils !
58007005	And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people , that is , from their brothers , though these also are descended from Abraham .
58007006	But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises .
58007007	It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior .
58007008	In the one case tithes are received by mortal men , but in the other case , by one of whom it is testified that he lives .
58007009	One might even say that Levi himself , who receives tithes , paid tithes through Abraham ,
58007010	for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him .
58007011	Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it the people received the law ) , what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek , rather than one named after the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For when there is a change in the priesthood , there is necessarily a change in the law as well .
58007013	For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe , from which no one has ever served at the altar .
58007014	For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah , and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests .
58007015	This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek ,
58007016	who has become a priest , not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent , but by the power of an indestructible life .
58007017	For it is witnessed of him , “ You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek . ”
58007018	For on the one hand , a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness
58007019	( for the law made nothing perfect ) ; but on the other hand , a better hope is introduced , through which we draw near to God .
58007020	And it was not without an oath . For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath ,
58007021	but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him : “ The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind , ‘ You are a priest forever . ’ ”
58007022	This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant .
58007023	The former priests were many in number , because they were prevented by death from continuing in office ,
58007024	but he holds his priesthood permanently , because he continues forever .
58007025	Consequently , he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , since he always lives to make intercession for them .
58007026	For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest , holy , innocent , unstained , separated from sinners , and exalted above the heavens .
58007027	He has no need , like those high priests , to offer sacrifices daily , first for his own sins and then for those of the people , since he did this once for all when he offered up himself .
58007028	For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests , but the word of the oath , which came later than the law , appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever .
58008001	Now the point in what we are saying is this : we have such a high priest , one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven ,
58008002	a minister in the holy places , in the true tent that the Lord set up , not man .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices ; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer .
58008004	Now if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law .
58008005	They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things . For when Moses was about to erect the tent , he was instructed by God , saying , “ See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain . ”
58008006	But as it is , Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better , since it is enacted on better promises .
58008007	For if that first covenant had been faultless , there would have been no occasion to look for a second .
58008008	For he finds fault with them when he says : “ Behold , the days are coming , declares the Lord , when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ,
58008009	not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt . For they did not continue in my covenant , and so I showed no concern for them , declares the Lord .
58008010	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , declares the Lord : I will put my laws into their minds , and write them on their hearts , and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
58008011	And they shall not teach , each one his neighbor and each one his brother , saying , ‘ Know the Lord , ’ for they shall all know me , from the least of them to the greatest .
58008012	For I will be merciful toward their iniquities , and I will remember their sins no more . ”
58008013	In speaking of a new covenant , he makes the first one obsolete . And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away .
58009001	Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness .
58009002	For a tent was prepared , the first section , in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence . It is called the Holy Place .
58009003	Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place ,
58009004	having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold , in which was a golden urn holding the manna , and Aaron’s staff that budded , and the tablets of the covenant .
58009005	Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat . Of these things we cannot now speak in detail .
58009006	These preparations having thus been made , the priests go regularly into the first section , performing their ritual duties ,
58009007	but into the second only the high priest goes , and he but once a year , and not without taking blood , which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people .
58009008	By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing
58009009	( which is symbolic for the present age ) . According to this arrangement , gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper ,
58009010	but deal only with food and drink and various washings , regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation .
58009011	But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come , then through the greater and more perfect tent ( not made with hands , that is , not of this creation
58009012	he entered once for all into the holy places , not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood , thus securing an eternal redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and bulls , and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer , sanctify for the purification of the flesh ,
58009014	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God , purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God .
58009015	Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant , so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance , since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant .
58009016	For where a will is involved , the death of the one who made it must be established .
58009017	For a will takes effect only at death , since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive .
58009018	Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood .
58009019	For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
58009020	saying , “ This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you . ”
58009021	And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship .
58009022	Indeed , under the law almost everything is purified with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins .
58009023	Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Christ has entered , not into holy places made with hands , which are copies of the true things , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf .
58009025	Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly , as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own ,
58009026	for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world . But as it is , he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
58009027	And just as it is appointed for man to die once , and after that comes judgment ,
58009028	so Christ , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , will appear a second time , not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him .
58010001	For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities , it can never , by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year , make perfect those who draw near .
58010002	Otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered , since the worshipers , having once been cleansed , would no longer have any consciousness of sins ?
58010003	But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year .
58010004	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	Consequently , when Christ came into the world , he said , “ Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired , but a body have you prepared for me ;
58010006	in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure .
58010007	Then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come to do your will , O God , as it is written of me in the scroll of the book . ’ ”
58010008	When he said above , “ You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings ” ( these are offered according to the law ) ,
58010009	then he added , “ Behold , I have come to do your will . ” He does away with the first in order to establish the second .
58010010	And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58010011	And every priest stands daily at his service , offering repeatedly the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
58010012	But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins , he sat down at the right hand of God ,
58010013	waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet .
58010014	For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified .
58010015	And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us ; for after saying ,
58010016	“ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , declares the Lord : I will put my laws on their hearts , and write them on their minds , ”
58010017	then he adds , “ I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more . ”
58010018	Where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer any offering for sin .
58010019	Therefore , brothers , since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain , that is , through his flesh ,
58010021	and since we have a great priest over the house of God ,
58010022	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water .
58010023	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering , for he who promised is faithful .
58010024	And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works ,
58010025	not neglecting to meet together , as is the habit of some , but encouraging one another , and all the more as you see the Day drawing near .
58010026	For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
58010027	but a fearful expectation of judgment , and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries .
58010028	Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much worse punishment , do you think , will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God , and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified , and has outraged the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know him who said , “ Vengeance is mine ; I will repay . ” And again , “ The Lord will judge his people . ”
58010031	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	But recall the former days when , after you were enlightened , you endured a hard struggle with sufferings ,
58010033	sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction , and sometimes being partners with those so treated .
58010034	For you had compassion on those in prison , and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property , since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one .
58010035	Therefore do not throw away your confidence , which has a great reward .
58010036	For you have need of endurance , so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised .
58010037	For , “ Yet a little while , and the coming one will come and will not delay ;
58010038	but my righteous one shall live by faith , and if he shrinks back , my soul has no pleasure in him . ”
58010039	But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed , but of those who have faith and preserve their souls .
58011001	Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for , the conviction of things not seen .
58011002	For by it the people of old received their commendation .
58011003	By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God , so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible .
58011004	By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain , through which he was commended as righteous , God commending him by accepting his gifts . And through his faith , though he died , he still speaks .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death , and he was not found , because God had taken him . Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God .
58011006	And without faith it is impossible to please him , for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him .
58011007	By faith Noah , being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen , in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household . By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance . And he went out , not knowing where he was going .
58011009	By faith he went to live in the land of promise , as in a foreign land , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , heirs with him of the same promise .
58011010	For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations , whose designer and builder is God .
58011011	By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive , even when she was past the age , since she considered him faithful who had promised .
58011012	Therefore from one man , and him as good as dead , were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore .
58011013	These all died in faith , not having received the things promised , but having seen them and greeted them from afar , and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth .
58011014	For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland .
58011015	If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out , they would have had opportunity to return .
58011016	But as it is , they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God , for he has prepared for them a city .
58011017	By faith Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son ,
58011018	of whom it was said , “ Through Isaac shall your offspring be named . ”
58011019	He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead , from which , figuratively speaking , he did receive him back .
58011020	By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau .
58011021	By faith Jacob , when dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , bowing in worship over the head of his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph , at the end of his life , made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones .
58011023	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that the child was beautiful , and they were not afraid of the king’s edict .
58011024	By faith Moses , when he was grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter ,
58011025	choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin .
58011026	He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt , for he was looking to the reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt , not being afraid of the anger of the king , for he endured as seeing him who is invisible .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood , so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them .
58011029	By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land , but the Egyptians , when they attempted to do the same , were drowned .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient , because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies .
58011032	And what more shall I say ? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets —
58011033	who through faith conquered kingdoms , enforced justice , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , were made strong out of weakness , became mighty in war , put foreign armies to flight .
58011035	Women received back their dead by resurrection . Some were tortured , refusing to accept release , so that they might rise again to a better life .
58011036	Others suffered mocking and flogging , and even chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned , they were sawn in two , they were killed with the sword . They went about in skins of sheep and goats , destitute , afflicted , mistreated —
58011038	of whom the world was not worthy — wandering about in deserts and mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
58011039	And all these , though commended through their faith , did not receive what was promised ,
58011040	since God had provided something better for us , that apart from us they should not be made perfect .
58012001	Therefore , since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses , let us also lay aside every weight , and sin which clings so closely , and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us ,
58012002	looking to Jesus , the founder and perfecter of our faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself , so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted .
58012004	In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood .
58012005	And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons ? “ My son , do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord , nor be weary when reproved by him .
58012006	For the Lord disciplines the one he loves , and chastises every son whom he receives . ”
58012007	It is for discipline that you have to endure . God is treating you as sons . For what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
58012008	If you are left without discipline , in which all have participated , then you are illegitimate children and not sons .
58012009	Besides this , we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them . Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live ?
58012010	For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them , but he disciplines us for our good , that we may share his holiness .
58012011	For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant , but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it .
58012012	Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees ,
58012013	and make straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed .
58012014	Strive for peace with everyone , and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord .
58012015	See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God ; that no “ root of bitterness ” springs up and causes trouble , and by it many become defiled ;
58012016	that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau , who sold his birthright for a single meal .
58012017	For you know that afterward , when he desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no chance to repent , though he sought it with tears .
58012018	For you have not come to what may be touched , a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
58012019	and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them .
58012020	For they could not endure the order that was given , “ If even a beast touches the mountain , it shall be stoned . ”
58012021	Indeed , so terrifying was the sight that Moses said , “ I tremble with fear . ”
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to innumerable angels in festal gathering ,
58012023	and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , and to God , the judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect ,
58012024	and to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel .
58012025	See that you do not refuse him who is speaking . For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth , much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven .
58012026	At that time his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , “ Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens . ”
58012027	This phrase , “ Yet once more , ” indicates the removal of things that are shaken — that is , things that have been made — in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain .
58012028	Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken , and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship , with reverence and awe ,
58012029	for our God is a consuming fire .
58013001	Let brotherly love continue .
58013002	Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers , for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
58013003	Remember those who are in prison , as though in prison with them , and those who are mistreated , since you also are in the body .
58013004	Let marriage be held in honor among all , and let the marriage bed be undefiled , for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous .
58013005	Keep your life free from love of money , and be content with what you have , for he has said , “ I will never leave you nor forsake you . ”
58013006	So we can confidently say , “ The Lord is my helper ; I will not fear ; what can man do to me ? ”
58013007	Remember your leaders , those who spoke to you the word of God . Consider the outcome of their way of life , and imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
58013009	Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings , for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace , not by foods , which have not benefited those devoted to them .
58013010	We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat .
58013011	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp .
58013012	So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood .
58013013	Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured .
58013014	For here we have no lasting city , but we seek the city that is to come .
58013015	Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God , that is , the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name .
58013016	Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have , for such sacrifices are pleasing to God .
58013017	Obey your leaders and submit to them , for they are keeping watch over your souls , as those who will have to give an account . Let them do this with joy and not with groaning , for that would be of no advantage to you .
58013018	Pray for us , for we are sure that we have a clear conscience , desiring to act honorably in all things .
58013019	I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order that I may be restored to you the sooner .
58013020	Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , the great shepherd of the sheep , by the blood of the eternal covenant ,
58013021	equip you with everything good that you may do his will , working in us that which is pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory forever and ever . Amen .
58013022	I appeal to you , brothers , bear with my word of exhortation , for I have written to you briefly .
58013023	You should know that our brother Timothy has been released , with whom I shall see you if he comes soon .
58013024	Greet all your leaders and all the saints . Those who come from Italy send you greetings .
58013025	Grace be with all of you .
59001001	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion : Greetings .
59001002	Count it all joy , my brothers , when you meet trials of various kinds ,
59001003	for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness .
59001004	And let steadfastness have its full effect , that you may be perfect and complete , lacking in nothing .
59001005	If any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask God , who gives generously to all without reproach , and it will be given him .
59001006	But let him ask in faith , with no doubting , for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind .
59001007	For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ;
59001008	he is a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways .
59001009	Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation ,
59001010	and the rich in his humiliation , because like a flower of the grass he will pass away .
59001011	For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass ; its flower falls , and its beauty perishes . So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits .
59001012	Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial , for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life , which God has promised to those who love him .
59001013	Let no one say when he is tempted , “ I am being tempted by God , ” for God cannot be tempted with evil , and he himself tempts no one .
59001014	But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire .
59001015	Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin , and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death .
59001016	Do not be deceived , my beloved brothers .
59001017	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change .
59001018	Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures .
59001019	Know this , my beloved brothers : let every person be quick to hear , slow to speak , slow to anger ;
59001020	for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God .
59001021	Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
59001022	But be doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving yourselves .
59001023	For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror .
59001024	For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like .
59001025	But the one who looks into the perfect law , the law of liberty , and perseveres , being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts , he will be blessed in his doing .
59001026	If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart , this person’s religion is worthless .
59001027	Religion that is pure and undefiled before God , the Father , is this : to visit orphans and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unstained from the world .
59002001	My brothers , show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory .
59002002	For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly , and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in ,
59002003	and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say , “ You sit here in a good place , ” while you say to the poor man , “ You stand over there , ” or , “ Sit down at my feet , ”
59002004	have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my beloved brothers , has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom , which he has promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor man . Are not the rich the ones who oppress you , and the ones who drag you into court ?
59002007	Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called ?
59002008	If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing well .
59002009	But if you show partiality , you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors .
59002010	For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it .
59002011	For he who said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ Do not murder . ” If you do not commit adultery but do murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
59002012	So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty .
59002013	For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy . Mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	What good is it , my brothers , if someone says he has faith but does not have works ? Can that faith save him ?
59002015	If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food ,
59002016	and one of you says to them , “ Go in peace , be warmed and filled , ” without giving them the things needed for the body , what good is that ?
59002017	So also faith by itself , if it does not have works , is dead .
59002018	But someone will say , “ You have faith and I have works . ” Show me your faith apart from your works , and I will show you my faith by my works .
59002019	You believe that God is one ; you do well . Even the demons believe — and shudder !
59002020	Do you want to be shown , you foolish person , that faith apart from works is useless ?
59002021	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar ?
59002022	You see that faith was active along with his works , and faith was completed by his works ;
59002023	and the Scripture was fulfilled that says , “ Abraham believed God , and it was counted to him as righteousness ” — and he was called a friend of God .
59002024	You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone .
59002025	And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way ?
59002026	For as the body apart from the spirit is dead , so also faith apart from works is dead .
59003001	Not many of you should become teachers , my brothers , for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness .
59003002	For we all stumble in many ways . And if anyone does not stumble in what he says , he is a perfect man , able also to bridle his whole body .
59003003	If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us , we guide their whole bodies as well .
59003004	Look at the ships also : though they are so large and are driven by strong winds , they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs .
59003005	So also the tongue is a small member , yet it boasts of great things . How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire , a world of unrighteousness . The tongue is set among our members , staining the whole body , setting on fire the entire course of life , and set on fire by hell .
59003007	For every kind of beast and bird , of reptile and sea creature , can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind ,
59003008	but no human being can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless our Lord and Father , and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God .
59003010	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing . My brothers , these things ought not to be so .
59003011	Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water ?
59003012	Can a fig tree , my brothers , bear olives , or a grapevine produce figs ? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water .
59003013	Who is wise and understanding among you ? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts , do not boast and be false to the truth .
59003015	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above , but is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
59003016	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist , there will be disorder and every vile practice .
59003017	But the wisdom from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , open to reason , full of mercy and good fruits , impartial and sincere .
59003018	And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace .
59004001	What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you ? Is it not this , that your passions are at war within you ?
59004002	You desire and do not have , so you murder . You covet and cannot obtain , so you fight and quarrel . You do not have , because you do not ask .
59004003	You ask and do not receive , because you ask wrongly , to spend it on your passions .
59004004	You adulterous people ! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says , “ He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us ” ?
59004006	But he gives more grace . Therefore it says , “ God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble . ”
59004007	Submit yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59004009	Be wretched and mourn and weep . Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom .
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will exalt you .
59004011	Do not speak evil against one another , brothers . The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother , speaks evil against the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but a judge .
59004012	There is only one lawgiver and judge , he who is able to save and to destroy . But who are you to judge your neighbor ?
59004013	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit ” —
59004014	yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring . What is your life ? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes .
59004015	Instead you ought to say , “ If the Lord wills , we will live and do this or that . ”
59004016	As it is , you boast in your arrogance . All such boasting is evil .
59004017	So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it , for him it is sin .
59005001	Come now , you rich , weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you .
59005002	Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and silver have corroded , and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire . You have laid up treasure in the last days .
59005004	Behold , the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you kept back by fraud , are crying out against you , and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts .
59005005	You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence . You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned and murdered the righteous person . He does not resist you .
59005007	Be patient , therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient about it , until it receives the early and the late rains .
59005008	You also , be patient . Establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
59005009	Do not grumble against one another , brothers , so that you may not be judged ; behold , the Judge is standing at the door .
59005010	As an example of suffering and patience , brothers , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59005011	Behold , we consider those blessed who remained steadfast . You have heard of the steadfastness of Job , and you have seen the purpose of the Lord , how the Lord is compassionate and merciful .
59005012	But above all , my brothers , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath , but let your “ yes ” be yes and your “ no ” be no , so that you may not fall under condemnation .
59005013	Is anyone among you suffering ? Let him pray . Is anyone cheerful ? Let him sing praise .
59005014	Is anyone among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the church , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . And if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
59005016	Therefore , confess your sins to one another and pray for one another , that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working .
59005017	Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed fervently that it might not rain , and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth .
59005018	Then he prayed again , and heaven gave rain , and the earth bore its fruit .
59005019	My brothers , if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back ,
59005020	let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins .
60001001	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who are elect exiles of the dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
60001002	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in the sanctification of the Spirit , for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood : May grace and peace be multiplied to you .
60001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! According to his great mercy , he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60001004	to an inheritance that is imperishable , undefiled , and unfading , kept in heaven for you ,
60001005	who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
60001006	In this you rejoice , though now for a little while , if necessary , you have been grieved by various trials ,
60001007	so that the tested genuineness of your faith — more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire — may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001008	Though you have not seen him , you love him . Though you do not now see him , you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory ,
60001009	obtaining the outcome of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
60001010	Concerning this salvation , the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully ,
60001011	inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories .
60001012	It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you , in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven , things into which angels long to look .
60001013	Therefore , preparing your minds for action , and being sober-minded , set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
60001014	As obedient children , do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance ,
60001015	but as he who called you is holy , you also be holy in all your conduct ,
60001016	since it is written , “ You shall be holy , for I am holy . ”
60001017	And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one’s deeds , conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile ,
60001018	knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers , not with perishable things such as silver or gold ,
60001019	but with the precious blood of Christ , like that of a lamb without blemish or spot .
60001020	He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you
60001021	who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead and gave him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God .
60001022	Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love , love one another earnestly from a pure heart ,
60001023	since you have been born again , not of perishable seed but of imperishable , through the living and abiding word of God ;
60001024	for “ All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass . The grass withers , and the flower falls ,
60001025	but the word of the Lord remains forever . ” And this word is the good news that was preached to you .
60002001	So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander .
60002002	Like newborn infants , long for the pure spiritual milk , that by it you may grow up into salvation —
60002003	if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good .
60002004	As you come to him , a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious ,
60002005	you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	For it stands in Scripture : “ Behold , I am laying in Zion a stone , a cornerstone chosen and precious , and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame . ”
60002007	So the honor is for you who believe , but for those who do not believe , “ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone , ”
60002008	and “ A stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense . ” They stumble because they disobey the word , as they were destined to do .
60002009	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for his own possession , that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light .
60002010	Once you were not a people , but now you are God’s people ; once you had not received mercy , but now you have received mercy .
60002011	Beloved , I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh , which wage war against your soul .
60002012	Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable , so that when they speak against you as evildoers , they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation .
60002013	Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution , whether it be to the emperor as supreme ,
60002014	or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good .
60002015	For this is the will of God , that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people .
60002016	Live as people who are free , not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil , but living as servants of God .
60002017	Honor everyone . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the emperor .
60002018	Servants , be subject to your masters with all respect , not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust .
60002019	For this is a gracious thing , when , mindful of God , one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly .
60002020	For what credit is it if , when you sin and are beaten for it , you endure ? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure , this is a gracious thing in the sight of God .
60002021	For to this you have been called , because Christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example , so that you might follow in his steps .
60002022	He committed no sin , neither was deceit found in his mouth .
60002023	When he was reviled , he did not revile in return ; when he suffered , he did not threaten , but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly .
60002024	He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we might die to sin and live to righteousness . By his wounds you have been healed .
60002025	For you were straying like sheep , but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls .
60003001	Likewise , wives , be subject to your own husbands , so that even if some do not obey the word , they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives ,
60003002	when they see your respectful and pure conduct .
60003003	Do not let your adorning be external — the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry , or the clothing you wear —
60003004	but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which in God’s sight is very precious .
60003005	For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves , by submitting to their own husbands ,
60003006	as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . And you are her children , if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening .
60003007	Likewise , husbands , live with your wives in an understanding way , showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel , since they are heirs with you of the grace of life , so that your prayers may not be hindered .
60003008	Finally , all of you , have unity of mind , sympathy , brotherly love , a tender heart , and a humble mind .
60003009	Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling , but on the contrary , bless , for to this you were called , that you may obtain a blessing .
60003010	For “ Whoever desires to love life and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit ;
60003011	let him turn away from evil and do good ; let him seek peace and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears are open to their prayer . But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . ”
60003013	Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good ?
60003014	But even if you should suffer for righteousness ’ sake , you will be blessed . Have no fear of them , nor be troubled ,
60003015	but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy , always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you ; yet do it with gentleness and respect ,
60003016	having a good conscience , so that , when you are slandered , those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame .
60003017	For it is better to suffer for doing good , if that should be God’s will , than for doing evil .
60003018	For Christ also suffered once for sins , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit ,
60003019	in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison ,
60003020	because they formerly did not obey , when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was being prepared , in which a few , that is , eight persons , were brought safely through water .
60003021	Baptism , which corresponds to this , now saves you , not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60003022	who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God , with angels , authorities , and powers having been subjected to him .
60004001	Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh , arm yourselves with the same way of thinking , for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ,
60004002	so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God .
60004003	For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do , living in sensuality , passions , drunkenness , orgies , drinking parties , and lawless idolatry .
60004004	With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery , and they malign you ;
60004005	but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead , that though judged in the flesh the way people are , they might live in the spirit the way God does .
60004007	The end of all things is at hand ; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers .
60004008	Above all , keep loving one another earnestly , since love covers a multitude of sins .
60004009	Show hospitality to one another without grumbling .
60004010	As each has received a gift , use it to serve one another , as good stewards of God’s varied grace :
60004011	whoever speaks , as one who speaks oracles of God ; whoever serves , as one who serves by the strength that God supplies — in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ . To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever . Amen .
60004012	Beloved , do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you , as though something strange were happening to you .
60004013	But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings , that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed .
60004014	If you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed , because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you .
60004015	But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler .
60004016	Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian , let him not be ashamed , but let him glorify God in that name .
60004017	For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God ; and if it begins with us , what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God ?
60004018	And “ If the righteous is scarcely saved , what will become of the ungodly and the sinner ? ”
60004019	Therefore let those who suffer according to God’s will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good .
60005001	So I exhort the elders among you , as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ , as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed :
60005002	shepherd the flock of God that is among you , exercising oversight , not under compulsion , but willingly , as God would have you ; not for shameful gain , but eagerly ;
60005003	not domineering over those in your charge , but being examples to the flock .
60005004	And when the chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the unfading crown of glory .
60005005	Likewise , you who are younger , be subject to the elders . Clothe yourselves , all of you , with humility toward one another , for “ God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble . ”
60005006	Humble yourselves , therefore , under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you ,
60005007	casting all your anxieties on him , because he cares for you .
60005008	Be sober-minded ; be watchful . Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion , seeking someone to devour .
60005009	Resist him , firm in your faith , knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world .
60005010	And after you have suffered a little while , the God of all grace , who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ , will himself restore , confirm , strengthen , and establish you .
60005011	To him be the dominion forever and ever . Amen .
60005012	By Silvanus , a faithful brother as I regard him , I have written briefly to you , exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God . Stand firm in it .
60005013	She who is at Babylon , who is likewise chosen , sends you greetings , and so does Mark , my son .
60005014	Greet one another with the kiss of love . Peace to all of you who are in Christ .
61001001	Simeon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ :
61001002	May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord .
61001003	His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness , through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence ,
61001004	by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises , so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature , having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire .
61001005	For this very reason , make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue , and virtue with knowledge ,
61001006	and knowledge with self-control , and self-control with steadfastness , and steadfastness with godliness ,
61001007	and godliness with brotherly affection , and brotherly affection with love .
61001008	For if these qualities are yours and are increasing , they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind , having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins .
61001010	Therefore , brothers , be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure , for if you practice these qualities you will never fall .
61001011	For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities , though you know them and are established in the truth that you have .
61001013	I think it right , as long as I am in this body , to stir you up by way of reminder ,
61001014	since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon , as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me .
61001015	And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things .
61001016	For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
61001017	For when he received honor and glory from God the Father , and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory , “ This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased , ”
61001018	we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven , for we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	And we have something more sure , the prophetic word , to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts ,
61001020	knowing this first of all , that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation .
61001021	For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man , but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit .
61002001	But false prophets also arose among the people , just as there will be false teachers among you , who will secretly bring in destructive heresies , even denying the Master who bought them , bringing upon themselves swift destruction .
61002002	And many will follow their sensuality , and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed .
61002003	And in their greed they will exploit you with false words . Their condemnation from long ago is not idle , and their destruction is not asleep .
61002004	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment ;
61002005	if he did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a herald of righteousness , with seven others , when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
61002006	if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction , making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly ;
61002007	and if he rescued righteous Lot , greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked
61002008	( for as that righteous man lived among them day after day , he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard ) ;
61002009	then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment ,
61002010	and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority . Bold and willful , they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones ,
61002011	whereas angels , though greater in might and power , do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these , like irrational animals , creatures of instinct , born to be caught and destroyed , blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant , will also be destroyed in their destruction ,
61002013	suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing . They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime . They are blots and blemishes , reveling in their deceptions , while they feast with you .
61002014	They have eyes full of adultery , insatiable for sin . They entice unsteady souls . They have hearts trained in greed . Accursed children !
61002015	Forsaking the right way , they have gone astray . They have followed the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who loved gain from wrongdoing ,
61002016	but was rebuked for his own transgression ; a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness .
61002017	These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm . For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved .
61002018	For , speaking loud boasts of folly , they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error .
61002019	They promise them freedom , but they themselves are slaves of corruption . For whatever overcomes a person , to that he is enslaved .
61002020	For if , after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in them and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
61002021	For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them .
61002022	What the true proverb says has happened to them : “ The dog returns to its own vomit , and the sow , after washing herself , returns to wallow in the mire . ”
61003001	This is now the second letter that I am writing to you , beloved . In both of them I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder ,
61003002	that you should remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles ,
61003003	knowing this first of all , that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing , following their own sinful desires .
61003004	They will say , “ Where is the promise of his coming ? For ever since the fathers fell asleep , all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation . ”
61003005	For they deliberately overlook this fact , that the heavens existed long ago , and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God ,
61003006	and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished .
61003007	But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire , being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly .
61003008	But do not overlook this one fact , beloved , that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness , but is patient toward you , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should reach repentance .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief , and then the heavens will pass away with a roar , and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved , and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed .
61003011	Since all these things are thus to be dissolved , what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness ,
61003012	waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God , because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved , and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn !
61003013	But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells .
61003014	Therefore , beloved , since you are waiting for these , be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish , and at peace .
61003015	And count the patience of our Lord as salvation , just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him ,
61003016	as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters . There are some things in them that are hard to understand , which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction , as they do the other Scriptures .
61003017	You therefore , beloved , knowing this beforehand , take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability .
61003018	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity . Amen .
62001001	That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we looked upon and have touched with our hands , concerning the word of life —
62001002	the life was made manifest , and we have seen it , and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life , which was with the Father and was made manifest to us —
62001003	that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you , so that you too may have fellowship with us ; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ .
62001004	And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete .
62001005	This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness , we lie and do not practice the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin .
62001008	If we say we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
62001010	If we say we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
62002001	My little children , I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin . But if anyone does sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous .
62002002	He is the propitiation for our sins , and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world .
62002003	And by this we know that we have come to know him , if we keep his commandments .
62002004	Whoever says “ I know him ” but does not keep his commandments is a liar , and the truth is not in him ,
62002005	but whoever keeps his word , in him truly the love of God is perfected . By this we may know that we are in him :
62002006	whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked .
62002007	Beloved , I am writing you no new commandment , but an old commandment that you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word that you have heard .
62002008	At the same time , it is a new commandment that I am writing to you , which is true in him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining .
62002009	Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness .
62002010	Whoever loves his brother abides in the light , and in him there is no cause for stumbling .
62002011	But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness , and does not know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I am writing to you , little children , because your sins are forgiven for his name’s sake .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because you have overcome the evil one . I write to you , children , because you know the Father .
62002014	I write to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God abides in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
62002015	Do not love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
62002016	For all that is in the world — the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions — is not from the Father but is from the world .
62002017	And the world is passing away along with its desires , but whoever does the will of God abides forever .
62002018	Children , it is the last hour , and as you have heard that antichrist is coming , so now many antichrists have come . Therefore we know that it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have continued with us . But they went out , that it might become plain that they all are not of us .
62002020	But you have been anointed by the Holy One , and you all have knowledge .
62002021	I write to you , not because you do not know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This is the antichrist , he who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one who denies the Son has the Father . Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also .
62002024	Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you . If what you heard from the beginning abides in you , then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is the promise that he made to us — eternal life .
62002026	I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you .
62002027	But the anointing that you received from him abides in you , and you have no need that anyone should teach you . But as his anointing teaches you about everything , and is true , and is no lie — just as it has taught you , abide in him .
62002028	And now , little children , abide in him , so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous , you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him .
62003001	See what kind of love the Father has given to us , that we should be called children of God ; and so we are . The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him .
62003002	Beloved , we are God’s children now , and what we will be has not yet appeared ; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him , because we shall see him as he is .
62003003	And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure .
62003004	Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness ; sin is lawlessness .
62003005	You know that he appeared to take away sins , and in him there is no sin .
62003006	No one who abides in him keeps on sinning ; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him .
62003007	Little children , let no one deceive you . Whoever practices righteousness is righteous , as he is righteous .
62003008	Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil , for the devil has been sinning from the beginning . The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	No one born of God makes a practice of sinning , for God’s seed abides in him , and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God .
62003010	By this it is evident who are the children of God , and who are the children of the devil : whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God , nor is the one who does not love his brother .
62003011	For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
62003012	We should not be like Cain , who was of the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother’s righteous .
62003013	Do not be surprised , brothers , that the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . Whoever does not love abides in death .
62003015	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him .
62003016	By this we know love , that he laid down his life for us , and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers .
62003017	But if anyone has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need , yet closes his heart against him , how does God’s love abide in him ?
62003018	Little children , let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth .
62003019	By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him ;
62003020	for whenever our heart condemns us , God is greater than our heart , and he knows everything .
62003021	Beloved , if our heart does not condemn us , we have confidence before God ;
62003022	and whatever we ask we receive from him , because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him .
62003023	And this is his commandment , that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another , just as he has commanded us .
62003024	Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God , and God in him . And by this we know that he abides in us , by the Spirit whom he has given us .
62004001	Beloved , do not believe every spirit , but test the spirits to see whether they are from God , for many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	By this you know the Spirit of God : every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God ,
62004003	and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God . This is the spirit of the antichrist , which you heard was coming and now is in the world already .
62004004	Little children , you are from God and have overcome them , for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world .
62004005	They are from the world ; therefore they speak from the world , and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are from God . Whoever knows God listens to us ; whoever is not from God does not listen to us . By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error .
62004007	Beloved , let us love one another , for love is from God , and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God .
62004008	Anyone who does not love does not know God , because God is love .
62004009	In this the love of God was made manifest among us , that God sent his only Son into the world , so that we might live through him .
62004010	In this is love , not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
62004011	Beloved , if God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God ; if we love one another , God abides in us and his love is perfected in us .
62004013	By this we know that we abide in him and he in us , because he has given us of his Spirit .
62004014	And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world .
62004015	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides in him , and he in God .
62004016	So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us . God is love , and whoever abides in love abides in God , and God abides in him .
62004017	By this is love perfected with us , so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment , because as he is so also are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love , but perfect love casts out fear . For fear has to do with punishment , and whoever fears has not been perfected in love .
62004019	We love because he first loved us .
62004020	If anyone says , “ I love God , ” and hates his brother , he is a liar ; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen .
62004021	And this commandment we have from him : whoever loves God must also love his brother .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God , and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him .
62005002	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and obey his commandments .
62005003	For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments . And his commandments are not burdensome .
62005004	For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world . And this is the victory that has overcome the world — our faith .
62005005	Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62005006	This is he who came by water and blood — Jesus Christ ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood . And the Spirit is the one who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005007	For there are three that testify :
62005008	the Spirit and the water and the blood ; and these three agree .
62005009	If we receive the testimony of men , the testimony of God is greater , for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son .
62005010	Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son .
62005011	And this is the testimony , that God gave us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	Whoever has the Son has life ; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life .
62005013	I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life .
62005014	And this is the confidence that we have toward him , that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us .
62005015	And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask , we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him .
62005016	If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death , he shall ask , and God will give him life — to those who commit sins that do not lead to death . There is sin that leads to death ; I do not say that one should pray for that .
62005017	All wrongdoing is sin , but there is sin that does not lead to death .
62005018	We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning , but he who was born of God protects him , and the evil one does not touch him .
62005019	We know that we are from God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
62005020	And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding , so that we may know him who is true ; and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . He is the true God and eternal life .
62005021	Little children , keep yourselves from idols .
63001001	The elder to the elect lady and her children , whom I love in truth , and not only I , but also all who know the truth ,
63001002	because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever :
63001003	Grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father’s Son , in truth and love .
63001004	I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth , just as we were commanded by the Father .
63001005	And now I ask you , dear lady — not as though I were writing you a new commandment , but the one we have had from the beginning — that we love one another .
63001006	And this is love , that we walk according to his commandments ; this is the commandment , just as you have heard from the beginning , so that you should walk in it .
63001007	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh . Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist .
63001008	Watch yourselves , so that you may not lose what we have worked for , but may win a full reward .
63001009	Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ , does not have God . Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting ,
63001011	for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works .
63001012	Though I have much to write to you , I would rather not use paper and ink . Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face , so that our joy may be complete .
63001013	The children of your elect sister greet you .
64001001	The elder to the beloved Gaius , whom I love in truth .
64001002	Beloved , I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health , as it goes well with your soul .
64001003	For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth , as indeed you are walking in the truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth .
64001005	Beloved , it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers , strangers as they are ,
64001006	who testified to your love before the church . You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God .
64001007	For they have gone out for the sake of the name , accepting nothing from the Gentiles .
64001008	Therefore we ought to support people like these , that we may be fellow workers for the truth .
64001009	I have written something to the church , but Diotrephes , who likes to put himself first , does not acknowledge our authority .
64001010	So if I come , I will bring up what he is doing , talking wicked nonsense against us . And not content with that , he refuses to welcome the brothers , and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church .
64001011	Beloved , do not imitate evil but imitate good . Whoever does good is from God ; whoever does evil has not seen God .
64001012	Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone , and from the truth itself . We also add our testimony , and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I had much to write to you , but I would rather not write with pen and ink .
64001014	I hope to see you soon , and we will talk face to face .
64001015	Peace be to you . The friends greet you . Greet the friends , every one of them .
65001001	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James , To those who are called , beloved in God the Father and kept forJesus Christ :
65001002	May mercy , peace , and love be multiplied to you .
65001003	Beloved , although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation , I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints .
65001004	For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation , ungodly people , who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65001005	Now I want to remind you , although you once fully knew it , that Jesus , who saved a people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority , but left their proper dwelling , he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day —
65001007	just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities , which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire , serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	Yet in like manner these people also , relying on their dreams , defile the flesh , reject authority , and blaspheme the glorious ones .
65001009	But when the archangel Michael , contending with the devil , was disputing about the body of Moses , he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment , but said , “ The Lord rebuke you . ”
65001010	But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand , and they are destroyed by all that they , like unreasoning animals , understand instinctively .
65001011	Woe to them ! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam’s error and perished in Korah’s rebellion .
65001012	These are hidden reefs at your love feasts , as they feast with you without fear , shepherds feeding themselves ; waterless clouds , swept along by winds ; fruitless trees in late autumn , twice dead , uprooted ;
65001013	wild waves of the sea , casting up the foam of their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever .
65001014	It was also about these that Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied , saying , “ Behold , the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones ,
65001015	to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way , and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him . ”
65001016	These are grumblers , malcontents , following their own sinful desires ; they are loud-mouthed boasters , showing favoritism to gain advantage .
65001017	But you must remember , beloved , the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001018	They said to you , “ In the last time there will be scoffers , following their own ungodly passions . ”
65001019	It is these who cause divisions , worldly people , devoid of the Spirit .
65001020	But you , beloved , building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	keep yourselves in the love of God , waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life .
65001022	And have mercy on those who doubt ;
65001023	save others by snatching them out of the fire ; to others show mercy with fear , hating even the garment stained by the flesh .
65001024	Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy ,
65001025	to the only God , our Savior , through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory , majesty , dominion , and authority , before all time and now and forever . Amen .
