40001001	THE ancestral line of Jesus Christ , son of David , son of Abraham :
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac ; Isaac was the father of Jacob ; Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers ;
40001003	Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah ; Perez was the father of Hezron ; Hezron was the father of Ram ;
40001004	Ram was the father of Amminadab ; Amminadab was the father of Nahshon ; Nahshon was the father of Salmon ;
40001005	Salmon was the father of Boaz ; Boaz was the father of Obed ;
40001006	Jesse was the father of David the King . David was the father of Solomon ;
40001007	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam ; Rehoboam was the father of Abijah ; Abijah was the father of Asa ;
40001008	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat ; Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram ; Joram was the father of Uzziah ;
40001009	Uzziah was the father of Jotham ; Jotham was the father of Ahaz ; Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah ;
40001010	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh ; Manasseh was the father of Amon ; Amon was the father of Josiah ;
40001011	Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile .
40001012	After the Babylonian exile , Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel ; Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel ;
40001013	Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud ; Abiud was the father of Eliakim ; Eliakim was the father of Azor ;
40001014	Azor was the father of Sadoc ; Sadoc was the father of Achim ; Achim was the father of Eliud ;
40001015	Eliud was the father of Eleazar ; Eleazar was the father of Matthan ; Matthan was the father of Jacob ;
40001016	Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
40001017	So there were in all fourteen generations from Abraham to David , and fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile , and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Christ .
40001018	The birth of Jesus was in this way : His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph , but before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Joseph , her husband , being an upright man , and yet not willing to make her a public example , resolved to dismiss her privately .
40001020	But while he was thinking this over , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , " Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife , for what has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus , for he will save his people from their sins . "
40001022	All this happened in fulfillment of what the Lord had spoken through the prophet :
40001023	" Behold the virgin will conceive and will bear a son , and they will call his name Immanuel " .
40001024	When Joseph awoke from sleep , he did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took his wife to his home .
40001025	But he did not live with her as a husband until she had borne a son . He called his name Jesus .
40002001	AFTER Jesus had been born in Bethlehem , in Judaea , in the days of Herod the King , wise men from the East arrived at Jerusalem ,
40002002	saying , " Where is he who has been born King of the Jews ? For we saw his star in the East and have come to do homage to him . "
40002003	When King Herod heard it , he was disturbed , and so was all Jerusalem .
40002004	Then he called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born .
40002005	They said to him , " In Bethlehem , in Juda . For so it was written by the prophet ,
40002006	' And thou , Bethlehem , land of Judah , art by no means least among the leaders of Judah ; for from thee will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel . ' "
40002007	Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them exactly the time of the star's appearance ,
40002008	and as he sent them to Bethlehem he said , " Go and make careful inquiries about the child , and when you have found him bring me word , so that I too may come and do homage to him . "
40002009	After hearing the king , they journeyed on , and the star which they had seen in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they were very joyful .
40002011	They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother , and they fell down and did him homage . Then they opened their treasures and presented to him gifts , gold and frankincense and myrrh .
40002012	After this they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod , and so went by another mad back to their own country .
40002013	After they had gone , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph and said , " Rise up , and take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt , and be there until I tell you , for Herod will search for the child in order to kill him . "
40002014	So Joseph rose up , and took the child and his mother in the night and went away to Egypt ,
40002015	and was there until the death of Herod , in order that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled , " Out of Egypt I called my Son . "
40002016	Then Herod , seeing that he had been outwitted by the wise men , became furious , and sent out and killed all the boy babies two years old and under in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood , guided by the date which he had carefully learned from the wise men .
40002017	Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet when he said ,
40002018	" A voice was heard in Ramah , wailing and bitter lamentation , Rachel weeping for her children , and she would not be comforted because they are not . "
40002019	But after Herod had died , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40002020	and said , " Arise , and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel , for they are dead who sought the child's life . "
40002021	So he arose , and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there , and being directed in a dream he went away to the region of Galilee
40002023	and settled in a town called Nazareth , so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled , " He will be called a Nazarene . "
40003001	IN those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wild part of Judaea
40003002	and saying , " Repent ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
40003003	For this is he who was foretold through Isaiah the prophet when he said : ' The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness , Make ready the way of the Lord , make straight his paths . ' "
40003004	This John had his clothing of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist , and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the neighborhood of the Jordan
40003006	and were baptized by him in the Jordan River , confessing their sins .
40003007	When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism , he said , " Brood of vipers , who directed you to flee from the coming wrath ?
40003008	Produce fruit fitting for a change of heart ,
40003009	and do not think of saying to yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father , ' for I tell you God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham .
40003010	Now the axe is lying at the root of the trees . Every tree that does not yield good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire .
40003011	I baptize you with water for a change of heart , but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I ; I am not worthy to carry his shoes ; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
40003012	He has his fan in his hand and will thoroughly clean his threshing-floor . He will gather his grain into his storehouse , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . "
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him .
40003014	But John opposed him , saying , " I have need to be baptized by you , and do you come to me ? "
40003015	Jesus replied , " Permit it now , for so it is fitting for us to complete every righteous act . " Then he permitted him .
40003016	Jesus , as soon as he was baptized , went up from the water , and the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon him .
40003017	A voice from the heavens said , " This is my Son , the beloved in whom I delight . "
40004001	THEN Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wild country to be tempted by the Devil .
40004002	After he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was hungry .
40004003	Then the tempter came and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , tell these stones to turn into loaves of bread . "
40004004	But he answered , " It is written , ' Man shall not live on bread alone , but on every word that comes from the mouth of God . ' "
40004005	Then the Devil took him with him to the holy city and placed him on the top of the temple
40004006	and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down ; for it is written , ' To his angels he will give charge of you , and on their hands they will bear you lest you strike your foot against a stone . ' "
40004007	Jesus said to him , " It is written , too , ' Thou shalt not try the Lord thy God . ' "
40004008	Again the Devil took him with him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory ,
40004009	and said to him , " All these things I will give you if you will fall down and do homage to me . "
40004010	Jesus said to him , " Begone , Satan , for it is written , ' To the Lord thy God alone shalt thou do homage , and him alone shalt thou serve . ' "
40004011	Then the Devil left him , and angels came and waited upon him .
40004012	When Jesus heard that John had been betrayed , he went away into Galilee .
40004013	Leaving Nazareth , he came and lived in Capernaum on the lake shore on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
40004014	so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled :
40004015	" Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , road to the sea , country beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ,
40004016	the people that sat in darkness saw a great light and upon those sitting in the land and shadow of death light dawned . "
40004017	From that time Jesus began to proclaim and say , " Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . "
40004018	As he was walking along the shore of the lake of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the lake , for they were fishermen ;
40004019	and he said to them , " Follow me and I will make you fishers of men . "
40004020	They at once left the nets and followed him .
40004021	Going on from there , he saw two other brothers — James the son of Zebedee and John his brother — in their boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
40004022	They at once left the boat and their father and followed him .
40004023	Jesus went around through the whole of Galilee , teaching in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people .
40004024	His fame spread out into all Syria , and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and those suffering from acute pain , demoniacs , lunatics , and paralytics , and he healed them .
40004025	Great crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan .
40005001	SEEING the crowds , he went up on the mountain , and when he had seated himself his disciples came to him .
40005002	He opened his mouth and taught them , saying :
40005003	" Blessed are the poor in spirit ! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005004	" Blessed are they that mourn ! For they will be comforted .
40005005	" Blessed are the gentle ! For they will inherit the land .
40005006	" Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness ! For they will have abundance .
40005007	" Blessed are the compassionate ! For they will receive compassion .
40005008	" Blessed are the pure in heart ! For they will see God .
40005009	" Blessed are the peacemakers ! For they will be called sons of God .
40005010	" Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness ! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
40005011	" Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and say every evil thing against you falsely for my sake !
40005012	Rejoice and be exceedingly glad , for your reward is great in heaven . For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	" You are the salt of the earth . But if the salt becomes flat , with what can it be salted ? It is good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A city cannot be hidden if set on a hill .
40005015	People do not light a lamp and put it under a peck-measure , but on the stand , and it gives light for all in the house .
40005016	So let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven .
40005017	" Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the Prophets . I have not come to do away with them , but to fill them full .
40005018	I tell you truly , until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or part of a letter will pass away from the Law , until all is done .
40005019	Whoever breaks one of these commandments , the least of them , and teaches men to do so , will be called least in the kingdom of heaven , and whoever does them and teaches them , he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I say to you that , unless your righteousness far exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	" You have heard that it was said to the men of old , ' Thou shalt not commit murder . Whoever commits murder shall answer for it to the court . '
40005023	So then if you are bringing your gift to lay on the altar , and there you remember that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there before the altar and go , first be reconciled to your brother , and then come and offer your gift .
40005025	Get on good terms with your adversary quickly while you are on the road with him , for fear that he may deliver you to the judge and the judge may deliver you to the officer and you may be cast into prison .
40005026	Truly I tell you you will not come out until you pay the last penny . "
40005027	" You have heard that it was said , ' Thou shalt not commit adultery . '
40005028	But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman with lustful thoughts has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye is a snare to you , pluck it out and cast it from you ; for it is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna .
40005030	And if your right hand is a snare to you , cut it off and cast it from you . It is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body go into Gehenna .
40005031	" It was said , ' Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce . '
40005032	But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife , unless for the cause of unchastity , makes her commit adultery , and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40005033	" Again , you have heard that it was said to the men of old , ' Thou shalt not swear falsely , but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths . '
40005034	But I tell you not to swear at all ; neither by heaven , because it is God's throne ;
40005035	nor by the earth , because it is his footstool ; nor by Jerusalem , because it is the city of the Great King ;
40005036	nor must you swear by your head , for you cannot make one hair white or black .
40005037	But let your yes be yes and your no be no . Whatever is more than these is from evil .
40005038	" You have heard that it was said , ' An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . '
40005039	But I tell you not to resist a wicked man , but if any one strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him also the other ;
40005040	and if any one is determined to sue you for your tunic , let him have your cloak too ;
40005041	and if any one commandeers you for a mile , go with him two .
40005042	To him who begs , give ; from him who wishes to borrow of you , do not turn away .
40005043	" You have heard that it was said , ' Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy . '
40005044	But I say to you , Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	that you may be sons of your Father in heaven ; for he makes his sun to rise upon the bad and the good , and sends rain upon the just and the unjust .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward have you ? Do not also the tax collectors do the same thing ?
40005047	And if you salute your brothers only , what superiority have you ? Do not the Gentiles do the same ?
40005048	You must be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect .
40006001	" BE careful not to do your religious actions before men in order to be seen by them . Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	When you give gifts of mercy , do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , in order that they may be honored by men . I assure you they get their payment in full .
40006003	But you , when you are giving a gift of mercy , must not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your gift may be in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will repay you .
40006005	" When you pray , you must not be like the hypocrites , for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so as to be seen by men . I assure you they get their payment in full .
40006006	But you , when you pray , go into your inner room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006007	" When praying do not keep repeating , as the Gentiles do , for they think that they will be heard because of their multitude of words .
40006008	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you have need of before you ask him .
40006009	Pray in this way : ' Our Father in heaven , Thy name be kept holy ;
40006010	Thy kingdom come ; Thy will prevail ; As in heaven , so on earth .
40006011	Our bread for the coming day Give us to-day ;
40006012	And forgive us our failures As we forgive those who fail toward us ;
40006013	And bring us not into trial , But save us from evil . '
40006014	For if you forgive men their wrongdoings , your heavenly Father will also forgive you ;
40006015	but if you do not forgive men , neither will your Father forgive you your wrongdoings .
40006016	" When you fast , do not wear gloomy faces as hypocrites do . For they disfigure their faces so as to be seen by men to be fasting . I assure you they get their payment in full .
40006017	But you , when fasting , anoint your head and wash your face ,
40006018	so as not to appear to men to be fasting , but to your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006019	" Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on the earth , where moth and rust corrode and where thieves break in and steal .
40006020	But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust corrodes and where thieves do not break in nor steal .
40006021	For where your treasure is there will your heart be also .
40006022	" The lamp of the body is the eye . If your eye is clear your whole body will be lighted up ,
40006023	but if your eye is bad your whole body will be darkened . If the light that is in you is darkness , how great the darkness is !
40006024	No one can serve two masters . For either he will hate one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and Mammon .
40006025	" Therefore I tell you , do not be anxious about your physical life — what you are to eat or what you are to drink ; nor about your body — what you are to wear . Is not the life more than the food and the body more than the clothing ?
40006026	Look at the birds of the air . They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns , but your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not of more value than they ?
40006027	But who of you by being anxious can add to his height one foot ?
40006028	And why are you anxious about clothing ? Consider the lilies of the field , bow they grow . They neither toil nor spin .
40006029	But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was arrayed like one of these .
40006030	If God so clothes the herbage of the field , to-day growing and to-morrow thrown into the oven , will he not much more clothe you , O you of so little faith ?
40006031	So do not be anxious , saying , What are we to eat ? or , What are we to drink ? or , What are we to wear ?
40006032	For all these things the pagans seek after . For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things .
40006033	But you must seek first his kingdom and his righteousness , and all these things will be supplied to you .
40006034	Do not be anxious about to-morrow , for to-morrow will take care of itself . Enough for the day is its own trouble .
40007001	" DO not judge , so that you may not be judged .
40007002	For with whatever judgment you judge you will be judged , and with whatever measure you measure you will be measured .
40007003	Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye , while you do not perceive the beam in your own eye ?
40007004	Or how will you say to your brother , ' Let me get out the speck from your eye , ' when there is a beam in your own eye ?
40007005	You hypocrite , first get the beam out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to get the speck out of your brother's eye .
40007006	" Do not give what is holy to the dogs , nor east your pearls before swine , for they may trample them under their feet and turn and tear you .
40007007	" Ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be opened .
40007008	For every one who asks obtains , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks the door is opened .
40007009	Is there any man of you who if his son asks him for bread will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish will give him a serpent ?
40007011	If you , though evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him .
40007012	" All things that you wish men to do for you , do yourselves for them ; for this is the Law and the Prophets .
40007013	" Enter through the narrow gate . For wide and spacious is the road that leads away to ruin , and many there are who go through it ;
40007014	but narrow is the gate and contracted is the road that leads into life , and few there are who find it .
40007015	" Beware of false prophets , such as come to you in the clothing of sheep , but inwardly are ravenous wolves .
40007016	From their fruits you will know them . Are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles ?
40007017	Just so every good tree yields fine fruit , but a worthless tree yields bad fruit .
40007018	It is not possible for a good tree to yield had fruit nor for a worthless tree to yield fine fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not yield fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	So then , from their fruits you will know them .
40007021	" Not every one who says to me , ' Master , Master , ' will enter into the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
40007022	Many will say to me on that day , ' Master , Master , did we not prophesy in your name , and in your name east out demons , and in your name do many miracles ? '
40007023	And then I will tell them plainly , ' I never knew you . Depart from me , you who work lawlessness . '
40007024	" Every one , therefore , who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock ;
40007025	and the rain descended and the rivers rose and the winds blew , and they beat upon that house ; but it fell not , for it had been founded on the rock .
40007026	And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand .
40007027	And the rain descended and the rivers rose and the winds blew , and they struck upon that house and it fell , and great was the ruin of it . "
40007028	When Jesus ended these words , the crowds were astonished at his teaching .
40007029	For he taught them like one who had authority , and not as their scribes taught .
40008001	WHEN Jesus had come down from the mountain , great crowds followed him .
40008002	And a leper came up and bowed before him , and said , " Sir , if you have the will , you have power to make me clean . "
40008003	Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him and said , " I have the will , be cleansed . " Instantly his leprosy was cleansed away .
40008004	Jesus said to him , " Be sure and do not say a word to any one , but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift which Moses prescribed as evidence for them . "
40008005	When Jesus had entered Capernaum there came to him a Centurion who implored his help .
40008006	" Sir , " he said , " my servant lies in my house a paralytic , in great distress . "
40008007	Jesus said to him , " I will come and heal him . "
40008008	The Centurion answered , " Sir , I am not worthy to have you come under my roof ; but just speak the word and my servant will be cured .
40008009	For I am a man , — under authority , — with soldiers under me , and I say to this one , ' Go , ' and he goes , and to another , ' Come , ' and he comes , and to my slave , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he was astonished and said , " Truly I tell you , I have not found so great faith on the part of any one in Israel .
40008011	I tell you many will come from the east and from the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the darkness outside . There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth . "
40008013	Then Jesus said to the Centurion , " Go . As you have believed , so be it to you . " His servant was healed that very hour .
40008014	When Jesus entered the house of Peter , he saw his wife's mother lying sick with fever .
40008015	He touched her hand and the fever left her . Then she arose and waited upon him .
40008016	When evening came , they brought to him many demoniacs and he cast out the spirits by a word , and all their sick he healed .
40008017	This was in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , " He took our weaknesses and bore away our diseases . "
40008018	When Jesus saw a crowd around him , he gave directions to go over to the other side of the lake .
40008019	Then a certain scribe came to him and said , " Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . "
40008020	Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have coverts , but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head . "
40008021	Another of his disciples said to him , " Sir , let me first go and bury my father . "
40008022	But Jesus said to him , " Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead . "
40008023	Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him .
40008024	Soon a great storm broke on the lake so that the boat was hidden under the waves ; but he was sleeping .
40008025	His disciples came to him and woke him and said , " Master , save us . We are going down . "
40008026	But he said , " Why are you frightened , you men of little faith ? " Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the lake , and there was a great calm .
40008027	The men were astonished and said , " What sort of a person is this , whom even the winds and the lake obey ? "
40008028	When he arrived at the other side , the country of the Gadarenes , there met him two demoniacs coming out of the tombs . They were very fierce , so that no one was able to pass along that road .
40008029	Suddenly they shouted , " Son of God , what have you to do with us ? Have you come here to torment us before the time ? "
40008030	There was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding .
40008031	The demons begged him , " If you cast us out , send us into the herd of swine . "
40008032	He said to them , " Go . " So they went out and entered into the swine . Then suddenly the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the waves .
40008033	The herdsmen fled and went away to the town and told everything , including what had happened to the demoniacs .
40008034	Then at once all the town came out to meet Jesus , and when they saw him they begged him to depart from their neighborhood .
40009001	SO Jesus got into the boat and crossed over and came to his own city .
40009002	They brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed . When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic , " Have courage , boy , your sins are forgiven . "
40009003	At once some of the scribes said to themselves , " This man is speaking profane words . "
40009004	Jesus knew their thoughts and said , " Why are you thinking evil thoughts in your hearts ?
40009005	For which is easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Rise and walk ' ?
40009006	But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins " — then he said to the paralytic , " Rise , take up your bed and go to your house . "
40009007	Thereupon he rose and went away to his house .
40009008	The crowds that saw it were astonished and gave glory to God , who had given such power to men .
40009009	As Jesus was passing along from there , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office . Jesus said to him , " Follow me , " and he arose and followed him .
40009010	It happened that , while he was reclining at table in the house , many tax collectors and sinners came in and reclined at the table with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	When the Pharisees saw it , they said to his disciples , " Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? "
40009012	Jesus heard it and said , " The strong have no need of a physician , but the sick have .
40009013	Go and learn what this means : ' I wish for kindness , and not for sacrifice . ' I have not come to call righteous people , but sinners . "
40009014	Then the disciples of John came to Jesus and said , " Why are we and the Pharisees fasting while your disciples are not fasting ? "
40009015	He said , " Can the bridal party fast while the bridegroom is with them ? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak , for the filling pulls away from the cloak and the result is a worse tear .
40009017	Nor do they pour new wine into old wine-skins , for if they do the skins burst . So the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined . But they put new wine into fresh wine-skins and both are preserved . "
40009018	While Jesus was talking to them , a synagogue Director came and bowed down before him and said , " My daughter has just died ; but come and lay your hand upon her and she will live . "
40009019	Jesus rose and followed him , and so did his disciples .
40009020	Suddenly a woman who had been suffering for twelve years from hemorrhage came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak .
40009021	For she said to herself , " If I touch only his cloak , I shall be healed . "
40009022	But Jesus turned and , seeing her , said , " Courage , daughter , your faith has healed you . " The woman was cured from that hour .
40009023	Jesus entered the house of the Director and saw the flute-players and the crowd that was noisily lamenting , and he said ,
40009024	" Leave the room , for the girl is not dead ; she is sleeping . " They laughed at him .
40009025	But after the crowd had been turned out , he went in and took hold of her hand and the girl rose up .
40009026	The report of this spread through all that country .
40009027	As Jesus was going along from there , two blind men followed him , calling out , " Have pity on us , Son of David . "
40009028	After he had entered the house , these blind men came to him . Jesus said to them , " Do you believe that I can do this ? " They said , " Yes , Sir . "
40009029	Then he touched their eyes and said , " According to your faith be it to you . "
40009030	And their eyes were opened . Jesus sternly commanded them , " Be sure and let no one know of this . "
40009031	But they went out and spread his fame through all that country .
40009032	As they were going out , a dumb man who was also a demoniac was brought to him .
40009033	After the demon had been cast out , the dumb man spoke . The crowd wondered and said , " Never was anything like this seen in Israel . "
40009034	But the Pharisees said , " Through the Chief of the demons he casts out the demons . "
40009035	Jesus made a circuit through all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the good news of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every infirmity .
40009036	Seeing the crowds , he was touched with compassion for them , for they were torn and flung down like sheep that have no shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , " The harvest is great , but the laborers are few .
40009038	Pray to the Master of the harvest to rush out laborers into his harvest . "
40010001	THEN , calling to him his twelve disciples , he gave them authority over impure spirits to cast them out , and power to cure every disease and every infirmity .
40010002	The names of the twelve apostles are these : Simon who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother , James the son of Zebedee and John his brother ,
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew , Thomas and Matthew the tax collector , James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus ,
40010004	Simon the Zealot , and Judas Iscariot , the one who betrayed him .
40010005	These twelve Jesus sent out and directed them : " Do not go into any way of the Gentiles . Do not enter into any city of the Samaritans .
40010006	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	As you go proclaim , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
40010008	Heal sick men , raise dead men , cleanse lepers , cast out demons . You received without paying , give without being paid .
40010009	Provide no gold nor silver nor copper in your belts ,
40010010	no bag for the road , nor two tunics nor shoes nor stick , for the workman has a right to his food .
40010011	Whatever city or village you go into , inquire who in it is worthy and stay with him until you leave the place .
40010012	When you enter the house , salute it .
40010013	If the house is worthy , let your peace come upon it ; but if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you .
40010014	If any one does not receive you or hear your words , as you go out of that house or that city shake off the dust of your feet .
40010015	I tell you truly it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city .
40010016	See , I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves . Be as wise as serpents and as pure as doves .
40010017	Be on your guard against men . For they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you ,
40010018	and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a witness to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	But when they deliver you up , do not worry how or what you are to speak . For it will be given to you in that hour what you are to say .
40010020	For it is not you who speak , but the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you .
40010021	Brother will betray brother to death , and father will betray child , and children will rise up against parents and put them to death .
40010022	And you will be hated by all for my name's sake . He who endures to the end , that one will be saved .
40010023	" When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . I tell you truly , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	The scholar is not above his teacher , nor the servant above his master .
40010025	It is sufficient for the scholar to fare like his teacher and for the servant to fare like his master . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more the members of his household .
40010026	Do not be afraid of them ; for there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed , nor secret which will not be known .
40010027	What I say to you in darkness speak in the light , and what is whispered into your ear proclaim on the housetops .
40010028	Do not fear before those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna .
40010029	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? Yet one of them will not fall on the ground without your Father .
40010030	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	So do not fear . You are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	Every one who shall confess me before men I too will confess before my Father in heaven .
40010033	Every one who shall disown me before men I too will disown before my Father in heaven .
40010034	" Do not think that I came to send peace on the earth . I came not to send peace , but a sword .
40010035	For I came to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
40010036	A man's enemies will be the members of his own household .
40010037	He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me . He who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
40010038	Whoever does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me .
40010039	He who finds his life will lose it , and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
40010040	He who receives you receives me , and he who receives me receives him that sent me .
40010041	He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophet's reward , and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous man's reward .
40010042	Whoever gives merely a cup of cold water to one of these little ones to drink because he is a disciple , I tell you truly he will not lose his reward . "
40011001	WHEN Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples , he went away from that place to teach and preach in the towns .
40011002	John had heard in prison of the doings of the Christ , and he sent by some of his disciples to ask ,
40011003	" Are you ' the Coming One ' or are we to expect some other ? "
40011004	Jesus answered them , " Go and tell John what you hear and see .
40011005	Blind men recover sight , lame men walk , lepers are cleansed , deaf men hear , dead men are raised , and poor men have the good news proclaimed to them .
40011006	Blessed is he who does not mistake regarding me ! "
40011007	As these men went away , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40011008	But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothes ? Those who wear soft clothes are in kings ' palaces .
40011009	But why did you go out ? To see a prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	This is the one of whom it was written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , who will prepare thy way before thee . '
40011011	I tell you truly there has not arisen among those born of women a greater than John the Baptist . But any inferior in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been suffering violence and violent men have been seizing it .
40011013	For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
40011014	If you are willing to believe it , he is Elijah who was to come .
40011015	Whoever has ears , let him hear .
40011016	" To what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the market-places who call to the others ,
40011017	' We played the flute to you and you did not dance ; we mourned and you did not beat your breasts . '
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ' He has a demon . '
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ' See a glutton and a wine-drinker ; a friend of tax collectors and sinners . ' Yet wisdom is proved to be in the right by her works . "
40011020	Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had been done , because they had not repented :
40011021	" Alas for you , Chorazin ! Alas for you , Bethsaida ! For if in Tyre and Sidon the miracles had been done which were done in you , they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	But I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum ! No , you will not be exalted to heaven . You will be abased to Hades . Because if those miracles which were done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
40011024	But I tell you it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you . "
40011025	At that time Jesus said , " I thank thee , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them to babes .
40011026	Yes , Father , I thank thee that such was thy good pleasure .
40011027	" All things have been delivered tome by my Father , and no one knows the Son but the Father , nor does any one know the Father but the Son and he to whom the Son may choose to reveal him .
40011028	" Come to me , all you who labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls .
40011030	For my yoke is easy and my burden is light . "
40012001	AT that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grain-fields . His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain to eat .
40012002	When the Pharisees saw it they said , " See , your disciples are doing what is not allowable on the Sabbath . "
40012003	He said to them , " Have you not read what David did , when he and his men were hungry ?
40012004	how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread which it was not allowable either for him to eat or for his men , but only for the priests ?
40012005	Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the Temple break the Sabbath and yet are guiltless ?
40012006	I tell you that something greater than the Temple is here .
40012007	If you had understood this , ' I desire kindness and not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the guiltless .
40012008	For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . "
40012009	Passing over from there , he came into their synagogue .
40012010	A man was there with a withered hand . They asked Jesus , " Is it allowable to heal on the Sabbath ? " — so that they might have something to accuse him of .
40012011	He said to them , " What man is there of you who , if he has one sheep , and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will not lay hold on it and lift it out ?
40012012	But how much more is a man worth than a sheep ! So it is allowable to do good on the Sabbath . "
40012013	Then he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He stretched it out and it was restored as sound as the other .
40012014	The Pharisees went out and plotted against him how they could destroy him .
40012015	But Jesus was aware of it and went away from that place . Many followed him and he healed them all ;
40012016	but he gave strict orders to them not to make him known .
40012017	It was in fulfillment of these words of Isaiah the prophet ,
40012018	" Behold my servant whom I have chosen , the Beloved in whom my soul delights . I will put my spirit upon him and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles .
40012019	He will not strive nor cry , nor will any one hear his voice in the streets .
40012020	A bruised reed he will not break , and a low-burning wick he will , not quench , until he has carried justice to victory .
40012021	In his name will Gentiles hope . "
40012022	Then there was brought to Jesus a demoniac , blind and dumb . He healed him so that he spoke and saw .
40012023	All the crowds were astonished and said , " Is not this man the Son of David ? "
40012024	The Pharisees when they heard it said , " This man casts out demons only through Beelzebul the Chief of the demons . "
40012025	But he knew their thoughts and said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself becomes a desolation , and no city or house divided against itself will stand .
40012026	If Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	If I by Beelzebul am casting out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
40012028	But if I am casting out demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is right upon you .
40012029	How can any one enter the house of a strong man and seize his goods unless he first binds the strong man ? Then he can plunder his house .
40012030	" He who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me scatters .
40012031	Therefore I say to you , every sin and profane word will be forgiven to men , but any profane word against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	Whoever says a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this world or in the world to come .
40012033	Either make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad . For from the fruit the tree is known .
40012034	Brood of vipers , how can you who are evil speak good things ? For from the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks .
40012035	The good man out of his good treasury pours out good things , and the bad man out of his bad treasury pours out bad things .
40012036	I tell you , for every idle word that men speak they will give full account in the day of judgment ,
40012037	for from your words you will be justified and from your words you will be condemned . "
40012038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him , " Teacher , we wish to see a sign from you . "
40012039	He answered them , " A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign . But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights , so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and more than Jonah is here .
40012042	The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and more than Solomon is here .
40012043	" When the impure spirit has gone out of a man , he passes through waterless places seeking rest and finds none .
40012044	Then he says , ' I will return into my house that I left . ' And he comes and finds it vacant , swept and in order .
40012045	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself , and they enter and live there . So the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . Just so will it be with this wicked generation . "
40012046	While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds , his mother and his brothers were standing outside , trying to speak to him .
40012047	Some one told him ,
40012048	but he replied , " Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? "
40012049	Then , stretching out his hand over his disciples , he said , " See my mother and my brothers !
40012050	For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother . "
40013001	ON that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the lake .
40013002	Great crowds gathered to him so that he got into a boat and sat in it , while all the crowd stood on the shore .
40013003	He spoke at length to them in illustrations . " A sower , " he said , " went out to sow .
40013004	And as he was sowing some seeds fell at the roadside and the birds came and ate them up .
40013005	Others fell on rocky places where they had not much soil , and at once they sprang up because they had no depth of soil .
40013006	But when the sun rose they were scorched , and because they had no roots they withered .
40013007	Others fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them .
40013008	Others fell on good ground and made a yield , some of a hundred fold , some of sixty fold , some of thirty fold .
40013009	He who has ears , let him hear . "
40013010	Then his disciples came to him and said , " Why do you talk to them in figures of speech ? "
40013011	He answered , " Because to you it is granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to those people it is not granted .
40013012	For whoever has , to him will be given and he will have abundance . But whoever has not , from him will be taken even what he has .
40013013	For this reason I speak to them in figures , because , though they see , they do not see , and though they hear , they do not hear nor understand ,
40013014	and to them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah : ' You will plainly hear , but you will not understand , and you will clearly look , but you will not see .
40013015	For the heart of these people has grown fat , and with their ears they are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed ; so that they may not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and repent and I should heal them . '
40013016	But blessed are your eyes , for they see , and your ears , for they hear .
40013017	I tell you truly many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you see , but they did not see them , and to hear the things you hear , but they did not hear them .
40013018	So listen to the story of the sower :
40013019	When any one hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it , the Evil One comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is the man who receives seed by the roadside .
40013020	He who received seed on stony ground is he who bears the word and receives it at once with joy ,
40013021	yet has no root in himself , but is inconstant , and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the message he stumbles and falls .
40013022	He who received seed among thorns is he who hears the message , but the care of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the message and it becomes fruitless .
40013023	He who received seed in good ground is he who hears the message and understands it and makes a yield of a hundred , or sixty , or thirty fold . "
40013024	Another illustration he put before them . He said , " The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	But while people were sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds through the wheat , and went away .
40013026	When the blades shot up and formed grain , the weeds also appeared .
40013027	Then the servants of the owner came and said to him , ' Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? Where do the weeds come from ? '
40013028	He replied , ' An enemy did this . ' The servants said to him , ' Do you want us to go and gather them up ? '
40013029	He said , ' No , for in gathering up the weeds you might pull up the wheat along with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest . At the time of harvest I will say to the harvesters , Gather up first the weeds and tie them into bundles for burning , but bring the wheat into my granary . ' "
40013031	Another illustration he put before them . He said , " The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field .
40013032	It is the least of all the seeds , but when it grows up it is greater than the garden herbs and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and live in its branches . "
40013033	Another illustration he spoke to them . " The kingdom of heaven is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened . "
40013034	All of these things Jesus spoke to them in illustrations , and without an illustration he spoke nothing to them ,
40013035	to fulfill the words of the prophet when he said , " I will open my mouth in illustrations , I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world . "
40013036	Then leaving the crowds he came into the house , and his disciples came to him and said , " Explain to us the illustration of the weeds of the field . "
40013037	He replied , " He who sows the good seeds is the Son of Man .
40013038	The field is the world . The good seeds are the sons of the kingdom . The weeds are the sons of the Evil One .
40013039	The enemy that sowed them is the Devil . The harvest is the end of the world . The reapers are angels .
40013040	As the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire , so shall it be at the end of the world .
40013041	The Son of Man will send his angels and they will gather up from his kingdom all stumbling-blocks and those who practice lawlessness ,
40013042	and will cast them into the furnace of fire . There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then will the righteous shine out like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears , let him hear .
40013044	" The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field , which a man finds and hides again , and for joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field .
40013045	" Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls .
40013046	Having found one very precious pearl he went away and sold everything that he had and bought it .
40013047	" Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the lake that gathered up every sort .
40013048	But when it was filled they drew it to the beach and sat down and gathered the good into pails , but threw the worthless away .
40013049	So will it be at the end of the world . The angels will come forth and will separate the wicked from among the righteous
40013050	and will cast them into the furnace of fire . There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
40013051	Have you understood all these things ? " They said , " Yes . "
40013052	He said to them , " Therefore every scribe educated in the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a householder who brings out from his storehouse new things and old things . "
40013053	When Jesus had finished these illustrations , he went away from that place .
40013054	Then he came to his native place and taught them in their synagogue so that they were astonished and said , " Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles ?
40013055	Is not this the carpenter's son ? Is not his mother named Mary and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
40013056	And his sisters — are they not all here with us ? Where then did he get all this ? "
40013057	So they fell into mistake about him . But Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and in his own house . "
40013058	Because of their unbelief he worked there but few miracles .
40014001	AT that time Herod the Prince heard the reports about Jesus
40014002	and said to his servants , " This is John the Baptist . He has risen from the dead and so miraculous powers are working in him . "
40014003	For Herod had arrested John and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife .
40014004	For John had said to him , " It is not lawful for you to have her . "
40014005	Although he wished to kill him , he was afraid of the people because they held him for a prophet .
40014006	But when Herod's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst and pleased Herod ,
40014007	so that he promised with an oath that he would give her whatever she asked .
40014008	She , prompted by her mother , said , " Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist . "
40014009	The king was grieved , but on account of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her ,
40014010	and he sent and had John beheaded in the prison .
40014011	The head was brought in on a platter and was given to the girl and she bore it to her mother .
40014012	The disciples of John came and took the body and buried it , and then they came and told Jesus .
40014013	Upon hearing of it , Jesus went away in a boat privately to an uninhabited place . But the people heard of it and followed him by land from the towns .
40014014	As he got out of the boat , he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them and healed their sick .
40014015	When evening had come on , his disciples came to him and said , " This is an uninhabited place and the time is already late ; send away the crowd so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food . "
40014016	But Jesus said to them , " They do not need to go away . Give them food yourselves . "
40014017	They said to him , " We have here nothing but five loaves and two fishes . "
40014018	He said , " Bring them to me . "
40014019	Then he commanded the crowd to recline on the grass , and he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looked up to heaven and asked a blessing . Then he broke up the loaves and gave them to his disciples , and the disciples distributed to the crowd .
40014020	All ate and had abundance , and they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that remained over .
40014021	Those who ate were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	Then he made his disciples get into the boat and go on across while he was dismissing the crowd .
40014023	After dismissing the crowd , he went up on the mountain by himself to pray , When evening came , he was there alone .
40014024	The boat was already far out from land , beaten by the waves , for the wind was against them .
40014025	In the fourth watch of the night , he came to them walking on the water .
40014026	When the disciples saw him walking on the water , they were terrified , saying that it was a ghost , and they cried out with fear .
40014027	But at once Jesus spoke to them and said , " Courage . It is I . Do not be afraid . "
40014028	Peter answered , " Sir , if it is you , bid me to come to you on the water . "
40014029	Jesus said , " Come . " Then Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus .
40014030	But seeing the wind he became frightened , and , beginning to sink , he cried out , " Sir , save me ! "
40014031	At once Jesus stretched out his hand and grasped him and said , " O man of little faith , why did you doubt ? "
40014032	After they got into the boat , the wind stopped .
40014033	Then the men in the boat bowed down to him and said , " Truly you are the Son of God . "
40014034	Having crossed , they came to land at Gennesaret .
40014035	When the men of that place recognized him , they sent into all that neighborhood and brought to him all the sick
40014036	and begged him that they might touch merely the tassel of his cloak , and all who touched were cured .
40015001	THEN scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said ,
40015002	" Why do your disciples violate the tradition of our forefathers ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food . "
40015003	He answered them , " And why do you violate the command of God for the sake of your tradition ?
40015004	For God said , ' Honor thy father and thy mother , ' and , ' If any one speaks evil of father or mother , let him surely die . '
40015005	But you say , ' Whoever says to his father or to his mother , Whatever benefit you get from me is now dedicated to God ,
40015006	he shall not honor his father or his mother . ' So you have nullified the command of God for the sake of your tradition .
40015007	You hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said ,
40015008	' This people honor me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
40015009	In vain they worship me while they teach as precepts the commands of men . ' "
40015010	Calling the crowd to him he said to them , " Hear and understand .
40015011	Not what enters the mouth defiles a man , but what comes out of the mouth — that defiles a man . "
40015012	Then his disciples came to him and said , " Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked when they heard what you said ? "
40015013	He replied , " Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted .
40015014	Beware of them . They are blind guides of the blind . If the blind leads the blind , both will fall into the ditch . "
40015015	Peter said , " Explain to us your figure . "
40015016	Jesus answered , " Are even you without insight ?
40015017	Do you not know that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is cast out into the sewer ?
40015018	But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart , and they defile the man .
40015019	For from the heart proceed wicked thoughts , murders , adulteries , unchastities , thefts , perjuries , profane words .
40015020	These are the things that defile a man . But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man . "
40015021	Leaving that place , Jesus retired into the region of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	Here a Canaanite woman of those parts came out and cried , " Sir , have pity on me , Son of David . My daughter is terribly tormented by a demon . "
40015023	But he did not answer her a word . Then his disciples came and begged him , saying , " Send her away ; she keeps calling out behind us . "
40015024	He replied , " I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . "
40015025	But she came and bowed before him and said , " Help me , Sir . "
40015026	He answered , " It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs . "
40015027	But she said , " Yes , Sir ; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters ' table . "
40015028	Then Jesus said to her , " O woman , great is your faith . Be it to you as you will . " And her daughter was cured from that hour .
40015029	On leaving there , Jesus came along by the lake of Galilee and went up on the mountain and sat down there .
40015030	Then a great crowd came to him having with them lame men , maimed men , blind men , mutes , and many others , and they laid them at his feet and he healed them .
40015031	The crowd was astonished when they saw mutes talking , maimed men sound , lame men walking about , and blind men seeing , and they gave glory to the God of Israel .
40015032	Jesus called his disciples to him and said , " I have compassion for the crowd , for they have now been with me three days and they have nothing to eat . I do not want to send them away fasting ; they might faint on the road . "
40015033	The disciples said to him , " Where can we get enough bread in this uninhabited place to feed such a crowd ? "
40015034	Jesus said , " How many loaves have you ? " They said , " Seven , and a few small fishes . "
40015035	Then he told the crowd to recline on the ground ,
40015036	and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and broke them and gave to his disciples , and the disciples distributed to the crowd .
40015037	All ate and were satisfied , and they picked up seven baskets full of fragments that were left over .
40015038	There were four thousand men that ate , besides women and children .
40015039	Then after dismissing the crowd he got into a boat and came into the region of Magadan .
40016001	THE Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus , and , in order to put him to a test , asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016004	But he answered , " A wicked and adulterous generation is eager for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah " ; and he left them and went away .
40016005	When the disciples got to the other side of the lake , they had forgotten to take bread ,
40016006	and Jesus said to them , " Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees . "
40016007	They were discussing this among themselves , saying , " It is because we have brought no bread . "
40016008	But Jesus , when he knew it , said , " Why are you discussing among yourselves , O men of little faith , because you have no bread ?
40016009	Do you not yet know ? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many basketfuls you picked up ?
40016010	Or the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many basketfuls you picked up ?
40016011	How is it that you do not perceive that I was not speaking to you about bread ? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016012	Then they understood that he had told them to beware not of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	After corning into the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi , Jesus asked his disciples , " Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? "
40016014	They said , " Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; others Jeremiah or some one of the prophets . "
40016015	He said to them , " But you , who do you say that I am ? "
40016016	Simon Peter said , " You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
40016017	Jesus replied , " Blessed are you , Simon Bar-Jonah , for flesh and blood have not revealed it to you , but my Father in heaven .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven . "
40016020	Then he strictly charged his disciples not to tell any one that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time Jesus began to make plain to his disciples that he had to go away to Jerusalem , and suffer greatly from the elders and high priests and scribes , and be killed and on the third day be raised .
40016022	Peter took him and began to reprove him , saying , " Please God , Sir ; this shall not happen to you . "
40016023	But he , turning , said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ; you are a snare to me , for you are not thinking God's thoughts , but men's . "
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " If any one chooses to come after me , let him disown self and take up his cross and follow me .
40016025	For whoever chooses to save his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it .
40016026	For what profit will a man have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul ? or what can a man give to buy back his soul ?
40016027	For the Son of Man will soon come in the glory of his Father with his angels , and then he will repay each in full according to his actions .
40016028	I tell you truly there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste of death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . "
40017001	Six days later , Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother , and led them up on a high mountain alone .
40017002	There he was transfigured before them . His face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as the light .
40017003	Then appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him .
40017004	Peter said to Jesus , " Sir , it is fine for us to be here . If you like , I will make three tents , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah . "
40017005	While he was speaking , a bright cloud suddenly overspread them and a voice issued from the cloud , " This is my Son , the Beloved , in whom I delight . Hear him . "
40017006	The disciples on hearing this fell on their faces in great terror .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them and said , " Rise and do not be afraid . "
40017008	When they raised their eyes , they saw no one but Jesus himself alone .
40017009	As they were descending the mountain , Jesus charged them , " Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
40017010	The disciples asked him , " Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? "
40017011	He answered , " Elijah does come and restore all things .
40017012	But I tell you Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him , but did to him whatever they chose . Just so the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands . "
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist .
40017014	When they reached the crowd , a man came to Jesus and knelt to him and said ,
40017015	" Sir , have pity on my son , for he is a lunatic and is in a very bad way . For often he falls into the fire and often into the water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples and they could not cure him . "
40017017	Jesus answered , " O unbelieving and perverse generation , how long must I be with you ? How long must I bear you ? Bring him here . "
40017018	Then Jesus rebuked the demon , and he came out of him and the boy was well from that hour .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus aside and said , " Why were we unable to cast it out ? "
40017020	He said to them , " Because of your lack of faith . I tell you truly , if you have faith like a mustard seed you will say to this mountain , ' Remove from here to there , ' and it will remove , and nothing will be impossible for you . "
40017022	While they were assembling in Galilee , Jesus said to them , " The Son of Man will soon be betrayed into the hands of men ,
40017023	and they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised " ; and they were deeply distressed .
40017024	After they came to Capernaum , the men who were collecting the Temple tax came to Peter and said , " Does not your teacher pay the Temple tax ? "
40017025	He said , " Yes . " But when he went into the house Jesus spoke first to him and said , " How do you think , Simon ? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes or tribute , from their own sons or from those who are not ? "
40017026	Upon his saying , " From those who are not , " Jesus said to him , " So then the sons are free .
40017027	But in order that we may not mislead them , go to the lake and throw in a hook and take the first fish that comes up . When you open his mouth you will find a coin . Take that and give it to them for me and yourself .
40018001	AT that time the disciples came to Jesus saying , " Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? "
40018002	He called to him a little child and stood him in the midst of them
40018003	and said , " I tell you truly , unless you turn and become like the little children , you will not enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	He who humbles himself like this little child , he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	Whoever receives one such little child for my name receives me ;
40018006	and whoever causes one of these little ones that believe in me to stumble , it were better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck and be cast into the depths of the lake .
40018007	Alas for the world because of the occasions of stumbling ! It must be that such occasions come , but alas for the man through whom any one is tripped up !
40018008	If your hand or your foot is a snare to you , cut it off and cast it from you . It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be cast into the fire eternal .
40018009	If your eye is a snare to you , pluck it out and cast it from you . It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than with two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire .
40018010	See to it that you do not look down on one of these little ones . For I tell you , in heaven their angels continually behold the face of my Father in heaven .
40018012	How does it seem to you ? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays away , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the straying one ?
40018013	And if he finds it , I tell you he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that have not strayed .
40018014	Just so it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish .
40018015	" If your brother sins against you , go and show him his fault between yourself and him alone . If he listens to you , you have won over your brother .
40018016	If he does not listen to you , take along with you one or two more , that at the mouth of two witnesses , or three , every word may be confirmed .
40018017	If he refuses to hear them , tell it to the church . If he refuses to hear the church , let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector .
40018018	I tell you truly , whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven .
40018019	" Again I tell you that , if two of you agree on earth regarding any matter , whatever they pray for will come to them from my Father in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three are gathered in my name , there am I in the midst of them . "
40018021	Then Peter came to him and said , " How often , Sir , if my brother sins against me , shall I forgive him ? Up to seven times ? "
40018022	Jesus said to him , " I do not say up to seven times , but up to seventy times seven .
40018023	" Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was a king , who determined to settle accounts with his servants .
40018024	When he had begun the accounting there was brought to him one who owed him ten thousand talents .
40018025	Since he could not pay , his master ordered him to be sold , as well as his wife and his children and whatever he had , and payment to be made .
40018026	But the servant fell down and did homage and said , ' Have patience with me and I will pay you in full . '
40018027	Then the master , pitying the servant , released him and cancelled his debt .
40018028	But that servant , on going out , found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred shillings , and he seized him and choked him , saying , ' Pay in full what you owe . '
40018029	His fellow servant fell down and begged , saying , ' Have patience with me and I will pay you in full . '
40018030	But he would not , but went and threw him into prison until he should pay off the debt .
40018031	When his fellow servants saw what had happened , they were deeply grieved and went and informed their master about everything .
40018032	The master summoned him and said to him , ' You wicked servant , all that debt of yours I cancelled when you begged me .
40018033	Ought you not to have had pity on your fellow servant as I had pity on you ? '
40018034	Then his master was angry and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay off all that was owing to him .
40018035	Just so will my Father in heaven do to you if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts . "
40019001	WHEN Jesus had finished these words , he left Galilee and came within that part of Judaea beyond the Jordan .
40019002	Great crowds followed him and he healed them there .
40019003	Then some Pharisees came to him to test him . They said , " Is it allowable for a man to divorce his wife for any and every cause ? "
40019004	He replied , " Have you not read that the Creator in the beginning ' made them male and female , '
40019005	and said , ' For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh ' ?
40019006	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . What , therefore , God has yoked together let not man put asunder . "
40019007	They said to him , " Why , then , did Moses command to give a writing of dismissal and divorce her ? "
40019008	He said to them , " Moses , because of your hard-heartedness , permitted you to divorce your wives , but at the beginning it was not so .
40019009	And I tell you , whoever divorces his wife , except for unchastity , and marries another , commits adultery . "
40019010	His disciples said to him , " If this is the case of a man with his wife , it is better not to marry . "
40019011	He said to them , " Not all can receive this word ; but only those to whom it is granted .
40019012	For there are eunuchs so born from their mother's womb , and there are eunuchs so made by men , and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . Let him who is able to receive it receive it . "
40019013	Then some little children were brought to him to have him lay his hands on them and pray . His disciples rebuked those who brought them .
40019014	But Jesus said , " Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them ; for of such is the kingdom of heaven . "
40019015	After laying his hands on them , he went away .
40019016	A man came to him and said , " Teacher , what good thing shall I do to have life eternal ? "
40019017	He said to him , " Why do you ask me about the good ? One only is the Good . But if you wish to enter into life , keep the commandments . "
40019018	He said to him , " Which ? " Jesus said to him , " Thou shalt not commit murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness ,
40019019	Honor thy father and thy mother , and Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . "
40019020	The young man said to him , " All these I have kept . What do I lack still ? "
40019021	Jesus said to him , " If you wish to be perfect , go sell your property and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and then come , follow me . "
40019022	When the young man heard that saying , he went away grieved . For he possessed great wealth .
40019023	Jesus said to his disciples , " I tell you truly , a rich man will with difficulty enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven . "
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were amazed and said , " Who then can be saved ? "
40019026	Jesus looked at them and said , " With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . "
40019027	Then Peter said , " Why , we have left everything and have followed you . What then shall we receive ? "
40019028	Jesus said to him , " I tell you truly , you who have followed me , in the rebirth , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my name's sake will receive manifold more and will inherit life eternal .
40019030	But many now first will be last and many now last will be first .
40020001	" THE kingdom of heaven is like a man who was a householder , who went out in the early morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
40020002	After agreeing with the laborers for a shilling a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	He went out about nine o'clock and saw others standing in the market-place idle
40020004	and said to them , ' You too go into my vineyard , and whatever is right I will give you . ' So they went .
40020005	Again he went out about noon and about three o'clock and did the same .
40020006	About five o'clock he went out and found others standing and said to them , ' Why have you been standing the whole day idle ? '
40020007	They said , ' Because no one has hired us . ' He said to them , ' You go too into my vineyard . '
40020008	When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his manager , ' Call the laborers and pay their hire , beginning with the last and going on to the first . '
40020009	When those who were hired about five o'clock came , they received a shilling apiece ,
40020010	and when those who were hired first came , they thought that they would get more . But they too received a shilling apiece .
40020011	When they received it , they grumbled at the householder
40020012	and said , ' These last worked one hour and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the heat . '
40020013	But he answered one of them , ' Friend , I am not wronging you . Did you not agree with me for a shilling ?
40020014	Take what belongs to you and go . I choose to give to this last man the same as to you .
40020015	Have I not the right to do what I will with my own ? Is your eye evil because I am good ? '
40020016	So the last will be first and the first last . "
40020017	As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve aside on the road and said to them ,
40020018	" We are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the high priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death
40020019	and will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify , and on the third day he will be raised . "
40020020	Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , bowing down to him and making a request of him .
40020021	He said to her , " What do you wish ? " She said to him , " Give the command for these two sons of mine to sit one on your right and one on your left in your kingdom . "
40020022	Jesus answered , " You do not know what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink ? " They said to him , ' We can ? '
40020023	He said to them , " My cup you will drink , but seats on my right and on my left are not mine to give . They will be given to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father . "
40020024	When the ten heard of this , they were indignant at the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them to him and said , " You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their great ones wield power over them .
40020026	It is not so among you . But whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant ,
40020027	and whoever wants to be first among you will be your slave ;
40020028	just as the Son of Man came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life a ransom for many . "
40020029	As they were leaving Jericho , a great crowd followed him .
40020030	Two blind men were sitting at the side of the road , and when they heard that Jesus was passing , they cried out , " Sir , have pity on us , Son of David ! "
40020031	The crowd rebuked them and told them to be silent . But all the more they cried , " Sir , have pity on us , Son of David ! "
40020032	Jesus stopped and called them and said , " What do you want me to do for you ? "
40020033	They said , " We want our eyes opened . "
40020034	Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes , and at once they regained sight and followed him .
40021001	WHEN they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	telling them , " Go into the village opposite and at once you will find an ass tied and a colt with her . Loose her and lead her to me .
40021003	If any one says anything to you , you will say , ' The Master has need of them , ' and at once he will send them . "
40021004	This happened in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled ,
40021005	" Say to the daughter of Zion , Behold thy king comes to thee , gentle and riding on an ass and on a colt , the foal of a beast of draught . "
40021006	The disciples went and did as Jesus had bidden them ,
40021007	and brought the ass and the colt , and spread on them their cloaks and seated him on them .
40021008	A very large crowd spread their cloaks in the road , and others cut off branches from the trees and spread them in the road .
40021009	The crowds that walked before and those that followed shouted , " God save the Son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! God in highest heaven save him ! "
40021010	When he entered Jerusalem all the city was shaken , and people said , " Who is this ? "
40021011	The crowds said , " This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee . "
40021012	Jesus went into the Temple courts and drove out all those who were selling and buying there . He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were selling doves ,
40021013	and he said , " It is written , ' My house shall be called a house of prayer , ' but you are making it a den of robbers . "
40021014	Then blind men and lame men came to him in the Temple courts and he healed them .
40021015	When the high priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did and the children shouting , " God save the Son of David ! " they were angry
40021016	and said to him , " Do you hear what these are saying ? " Jesus said , " Yes . Have you never read , ' Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ' ? "
40021017	Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there .
40021018	Early in the morning as he was returning to the city , he was hungry ,
40021019	and seeing a solitary fig tree at the roadside he went to it , but found on it nothing but leaves only . He said to it , " Let there no more be fruit from you forever . " The fig tree immediately withered up .
40021020	Upon seeing this , the disciples were astonished and said , " How suddenly the fig tree withered up ! "
40021021	Jesus said to them , " I tell you truly , if you have faith and do not doubt , you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree , but if you say to this mountain , ' Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ' that will happen ,
40021022	and whatever you ask in prayer , believing , you will obtain . "
40021023	When he had gone into the Temple courts , the high priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said , " By what authority are you doing this , and who gave you this authority ? "
40021024	Jesus replied to them , " I too will ask you one question . If you answer me , then I also will tell you by what authority I am doing this .
40021025	The baptism of John — where did it come from ? From heaven or from men ? " They debated among themselves , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will say to us , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
40021026	and if we say , ' From men , ' we are afraid of the people , for they all hold John for a prophet . "
40021027	So they answered Jesus , " We do not know . " He in turn said to them , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing this .
40021028	What do you think ? A man had two sons . He went to the first and said , ' Son , go to-day and work in the vineyard . '
40021029	He answered , ' I will , Sir , ' but he did not go .
40021030	The father went to the second son and said the same . He answered , ' I will not , ' but afterwards he changed his mind and went .
40021031	Which of the two did the will of his father ? " They said , " The last . " Jesus said to them , " I tell you truly the tax collectors and the bad women are going before you into the kingdom of God .
40021032	For John came to you in the path of righteousness and you did not believe him . But the tax collectors and the bad women believed him . And you when you saw it did not change your minds afterwards and believe him .
40021033	" Listen to another illustration : There was a man , a house-holder , who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a wine-vat in it and built a watch-tower , and let it out to grape-growers and went abroad .
40021034	When the time of fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the grape-growers to get his fruit .
40021035	But the grape-growers seized the servants , and one they beat , one they killed , one they pelted with stones .
40021036	Again he sent other servants , more numerous than the first , but they treated them just the same .
40021037	At last he sent to them his son , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
40021038	But when the grape-growers saw the son , they said among themselves , ' This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and we shall have his inheritance . '
40021039	So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
40021040	When , therefore , the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those grape-growers ? "
40021041	They said to him , " He will put those miserable men to a miserable death , and will let out the vineyard to other grape-growers who will render him the fruits in their seasons . "
40021042	Jesus said to them , " Did you never read in the Scriptures , ' The stone which the builders rejected , that one has become the corner stone . This stone came from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes ' ?
40021043	Therefore I tell you the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation that produces the fruits .
40021044	Whoever falls on this stone will be shattered , and if it falls on any one , it will crush him to powder . "
40021045	The high priests and the Pharisees listening to his illustrations knew that he was speaking about them .
40021046	They were eager to seize him , but were afraid of the people , for the people held him for a prophet .
40022001	AGAIN Jesus addressed them in figures . He said ,
40022002	" The kingdom of heaven is like a man , a king , who made a wedding feast for his son .
40022003	He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding , but they would not come .
40022004	Again he sent other servants , telling them , ' Say to those who have been invited , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and fat things have been killed and everything is ready . Come to the wedding . '
40022005	But they paid no attention , and went off one to his field and another to his trading .
40022006	The rest seized his servants , treated them roughly , and killed them .
40022007	Then the king grew angry and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , ' The wedding banquet is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
40022009	Go out on the crossroads , and every one you find invite to the wedding . '
40022010	So those servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found , both bad and good , and the wedding-hall was filled with guests .
40022011	When the king came in to look over the guests , he saw there a man who was not dressed in a wedding robe ,
40022012	and he said to him , ' Friend , how did you come in here without a wedding robe ? ' But he was speechless .
40022013	The king said to the attendants , ' Bind him feet and hands and throw him out into the darkness outside . ' There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
40022014	For many are invited , but few are chosen . "
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and held a consultation how they could entrap him in talk .
40022016	They sent to him their disciples with the Herodians and they said , " Teacher , we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth , and that you are afraid of no one , for you do not regard the social standing of men .
40022017	Tell us therefore what you think . Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? "
40022018	But Jesus knew their wickedness and said , " Why are you trying to test me , you hypocrites ?
40022019	Show me a piece of tax money . " They brought him a shilling .
40022020	He asked them , " Whose head is this , and whose inscription ? "
40022021	They said , " Caesar's . " He said to them , " Then pay to Caesar what is Caesar's , and pay to God what is God's . "
40022022	When they heard this , they wondered and left him and went away .
40022023	On that day some Sadducees came to him asserting that there is no resurrection , and they asked him ,
40022024	" Teacher , Moses said , ' If any man dies childless , his brother shall marry his widow and raise up offspring for his brother . '
40022025	Now there were with us seven brothers . The first married and died childless and left his wife to his brother .
40022026	So did the second and the third down to the seventh .
40022027	The woman died last of all .
40022028	In the resurrection , then , which of the seven will have the wife ? For they all had her . "
40022029	Jesus replied to them , " You are all astray because you do not understand either the Scriptures or the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurrection they neither many nor are married , but are like the angels in heaven .
40022031	But in reference to the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was said to you by God when he said ,
40022032	' I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ' ? He is not the God of dead men , but of living men . "
40022033	The crowd on hearing this were amazed at his teaching .
40022034	The Pharisees , hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees , gathered ,
40022035	and one of them , a lawyer , in order to test him , asked ,
40022036	" Teacher , which commandment in the law is greatest ? "
40022037	Jesus said to him , " ' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind . '
40022038	This is the greatest and first commandment .
40022039	The second is like it , ' Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . '
40022040	On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets . "
40022041	While the Pharisees were assembled , Jesus asked them a question ,
40022042	" What do you think in regard to the Christ ? Whose son is he ? " They said , " David's . "
40022043	He said , " How then does David by inspiration call him ' Lord , ' saying ,
40022044	' The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet ' ?
40022045	If David calls him ' Lord , ' how is he his son ? "
40022046	No one was able to answer him a word , and no one from that day dared ask him any more questions .
40023001	THEN Jesus addressed the crowd and his disciples .
40023002	He said , " The scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves on Moses ' seat .
40023003	So whatever they tell you , do and observe , but do not do as they do . For they say and do not .
40023004	They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders , but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
40023005	All their works they do to be seen by men . They make their phylacteries broad and make their tassels large .
40023006	They love the best couches at dinners and the front seats in the synagogues
40023007	and salutations in the markets and to be called by men Rabbi .
40023008	But do not you be called Rabbi . For one is your Teacher and all of you are brothers .
40023009	And do not call any one on earth Father , for one is your Father in heaven .
40023010	Neither be called guides , for your Guide is one alone — the Christ .
40023011	The greatest of you will be your servant .
40023012	Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted .
40023013	" But alas for you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you shut the kingdom of heaven before men . You yourselves do not enter nor do you permit those who are entering to go in .
40023015	Alas for you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is won you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves .
40023016	Alas for you , blind guides ! You say , ' Whoever swears by the Temple , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gold of the Temple is bound . '
40023017	Fools and blind , which is greater , the gold or the Temple that makes the gold holy ?
40023018	You say , ' Whoever swears by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound . '
40023019	You blind , which is greater , the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy ?
40023020	He , then , who swears by the altar swears by it and everything on it ,
40023021	and he who swears by the Temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it ,
40023022	and he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it .
40023023	" Alas for you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you pay tithes of mint , dill , and carraway and have disregarded the weightier matters of the law — justice and kindness and good faith . These you should have practiced , without neglecting those other things .
40023024	Blind guides , who strain out a gnat and drink down a camel !
40023025	Alas for you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish , but inside they are full through greed and self-indulgence .
40023026	Blind Pharisees , cleanse first the inside of your cup so that the outside of it may become clean also .
40023027	Alas for you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you are like whitewashed tombs which outside appear beautiful , but inside are full of dead men's bones and every kind of uncleanness .
40023028	So you , too , outwardly appear to men to be righteous , but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
40023029	" Alas for you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous
40023030	and say , ' If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
40023031	So you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers ' guilt .
40023033	Serpents , brood of vipers , how can you escape being sentenced to Gehenna ?
40023034	Therefore I am sending to you prophets and wise men and scribes . Some of them you will kill and crucify , and some you will scourge in your synagogues and will persecute from city to city ,
40023035	so that all the righteous blood shed on earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah the son of Barachiah , whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar , may come on you .
40023036	I tell you truly all this will come on this generation .
40023037	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you , how often would I fain have gathered your children as a bird gathers her nestlings under her wings , and you would not .
40023038	See , your house is left to you desolate ,
40023039	for I tell you , you will not see me from now on until you say , ' Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
40024001	JESUS left the Temple courts and was going away when his disciples came to point out to him the Temple buildings .
40024002	He answered them , " Do you not see all these things ? I tell you truly there will not be left here one stone upon another which will not be thrown down . "
40024003	While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately and said , " Tell us when these things will be , and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world ? "
40024004	Jesus answered them , " Make sure that no one misleads you .
40024005	For many will come in my name and will say , ' I am the Christ , ' and they will lead many astray .
40024006	You will soon hear of wars and rumors of wars . Take care and do not be alarmed , for such things must be ; but the end is not yet .
40024007	For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be famines and earthquakes here and there .
40024008	All of these things are the beginnings of birth-pangs .
40024009	Then they will deliver you up to persecution and will kill you , and you will be hated by all the Gentiles on account of my name .
40024010	Then many will stumble and fall and will betray one another and will hate one another .
40024011	Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray ,
40024012	and because of the wide spread of lawlessness the love of most will grow cold .
40024013	But he who endures to the end , he will be saved .
40024014	And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the inhabited world for a testimony to all the Gentiles . And then will come the end .
40024015	" So when you see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place Let the reader understand ,
40024016	then those who are in Judaea are to flee to the mountains ;
40024017	he who is on the house is not to go down to take the things out of his house ,
40024018	and he who is in the field is not to turn back and take his cloak .
40024019	Alas , for the women with child and the nursing mothers in those days !
40024020	Pray that your flight may not be in the winter nor on the Sabbath .
40024021	For there will be then great suffering , such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now , nor ever shall be again .
40024022	" Unless those days had been shortened none would be saved ; but for the sake of the chosen those days will be shortened .
40024023	Then if any one says to you , ' See , here is the Christ , ' or ' here , ' do not believe him .
40024024	For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead , if possible , even the chosen .
40024025	See , I have told you beforehand .
40024026	So , if they say to you , ' He is in the wilderness , ' do not go out there . If they say , ' in the inner rooms , ' do not believe it .
40024027	For as the lightning comes out of the east and shines across to the west , so will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40024028	Wherever the carcass is , there will the vultures flock together .
40024029	" Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give her light , and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of heaven will be shaken .
40024030	And then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven . Then will all the tribes of the earth beat their breasts for grief , and they will see the Son of Man as he comes on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40024031	And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet-blast , and they will gather his chosen from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
40024032	" From the fig tree take an illustration . When now its branch becomes soft and puts out leaves , you know that summer is near .
40024033	Just so when you see all these things , know that he is near — at the door .
40024034	Truly I tell you , this generation will not pass away before all these things happen .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
40024036	But of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , not even the Son , but the Father alone .
40024037	For , as the days of Noah were , so will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40024038	As in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah went into the ark ,
40024039	and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away , so will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40024040	Then there will be two men in the field . One will be taken with him and one will be left .
40024041	There will be two women grinding at the mill . One will be taken with him and one will be left .
40024042	Watch , therefore , for you do not know what day your Master is coming .
40024043	But this you do know , that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into .
40024044	Therefore be you also ready , for in an hour that you do not think the Son of Man is coming .
40024045	Who , then , is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has placed over his household to give them food in due season ?
40024046	Blessed is that servant whom his master , when he comes , will find so doing .
40024047	I tell you truly that he will place him over all that he owns .
40024048	But if that wicked servant says in his heart , ' My master is delaying , '
40024049	and begins to strike his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken ,
40024050	the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting and at an hour when he is unaware ,
40024051	and will cut him asunder and assign his part with the hypocrites . There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
40025001	" THEN the kingdom of heaven will be like ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish and five were wise ;
40025003	for the foolish ones took their lamps , but took with them no oil ;
40025004	while the wise took oil in their flasks with their lamps .
40025005	As the bridegroom was late in coining , all grew drowsy and slept .
40025006	At midnight a cry was raised , ' Here is the bridegroom . Come out to meet him ! '
40025007	Then all those maidens arose and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	But the foolish said to the wise , ' Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . '
40025009	But the wise answered , ' There may not be enough for us and you . Go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves . '
40025010	While they were going to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding , and the door was shut .
40025011	Afterwards came the rest of the maidens , saying , ' Master , Master , open for us . '
40025012	But he answered , ' I tell you truly I do not know you . '
40025013	Watch , therefore , for you do not know the day nor the hour .
40025014	" It is just as when a man going abroad called his servants and committed to them his property .
40025015	To one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one , to each according to his particular ability . Then he went abroad .
40025016	At once he who received the five talents went and traded with them and gained five more .
40025017	In the same way he who received the two gained two more .
40025018	But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the ground and hid his master's money .
40025019	After a long time the master of those servants came and had an accounting with them .
40025020	The man who had received the five talents came and brought five talents more , saying , ' Master , you committed to me five talents ; see , I have gained five talents more . '
40025021	His master said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . You have been faithful over a few things , I will place you over many things . Enter into the joy of your master . '
40025022	The man who had received the two talents came and said , ' Master , you committed to me two talents ; see , I have gained two talents more . '
40025023	His master said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant , you have been faithful over a few things , I will place you over many things . Enter into the joy of your master . '
40025024	Then the man who had received the one talent came and said , ' Master , I knew that you were a hard man , reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not thresh ,
40025025	and I was afraid , and went away and hid your talent in the ground . There , you have your own . '
40025026	His master replied , ' You wicked and idle servant . Did you know that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not thresh ?
40025027	Then you ought to have turned over my money to the bankers , and at my coming I should have received my own with interest .
40025028	Take from him the talent and give it to him who has the ten talents .
40025029	For to every one who has will be given , and he will have abundance ; but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken .
40025030	And the worthless servant throw out into the darkness outside . There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth . '
40025031	" When the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then he will sit on his glorious throne
40025032	and all the nations will be assembled before him . And he will divide them one from another as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats .
40025033	He will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left .
40025034	Then will the King say to those on his right hand , ' Come , you who have been blessed by my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world !
40025035	For I was hungry and you gave me food ; I was thirsty and you gave me drink ; I was a stranger and you took me in ;
40025036	naked and you clothed me . I was sick and you cared for me . I was in prison and you came to me . '
40025037	Then will the righteous answer , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you drink ?
40025038	When did we see you a stranger and take you in , or naked and clothe you ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you ? '
40025040	The King will answer , ' I tell you truly , inasmuch as you did it to one of these my brothers — even the least — you did it to me . '
40025041	Then he will say to those on his left hand , ' Depart from me , you cursed , into the fire eternal prepared for the Devil and his angels .
40025042	For I was hungry and you gave me no food ; I was thirsty and you gave me no drink ;
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not take me in ; naked and you did not clothe me ; sick and in prison and you did not care for me . '
40025044	Then they too will answer , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not serve you ? '
40025045	He will answer them , ' I tell you truly inasmuch as you did not do it to one of these least , you did not do it to me . '
40025046	These will go away into punishment eternal , but the righteous into life eternal . "
40026001	WHEN Jesus had finished all these discourses , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	" You know that after two days comes the Passover , and the Son of Man is to be betrayed to be crucified . "
40026003	Then the high priests and the elders of the people assembled at the house of the High Priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
40026004	and they plotted to seize Jesus by some trick and kill him .
40026005	But they said , " Not on the feast day , so that there may not be a riot among the people . "
40026006	When Jesus had come to Bethany and was in the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	a woman came up to him , bringing an alabaster jar of costly ointment , and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table .
40026008	On seeing this , the disciples were indignant and said , " Why this waste ?
40026009	This could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor . "
40026010	But Jesus observed it and said , " Why are you troubling the woman ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
40026011	You have the poor with you always , but me you will not have always .
40026012	For in pouring this ointment on my body she prepared me for burial .
40026013	I tell you truly wherever this good news shall be proclaimed in the whole world , what she has done will be spoken of too in memory of her . "
40026014	Then one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the high priests
40026015	and asked , " What will you give me if I betray him to you ? " They paid him thirty pieces of silver .
40026016	And from that moment he kept seeking a favorable time to betray him .
40026017	On the first day of unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus and said , " Where do you wish us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? "
40026018	He answered , " Go into the city to a certain man and say to him , ' The Teacher says , My time is near . I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house . '
40026019	The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover .
40026020	When evening had come , he was reclining at table with the twelve disciples .
40026021	While they were eating , he said , " I tell you truly one of you will betray me . "
40026022	Greatly grieved , they began to ask him , each in turn , " It is not I , Master ? "
40026023	He answered , " He who dipped his band with me in the dish is the one who will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man is going as it has been written of him , but alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! For that man it would be good not to have been born . "
40026025	Then Judas the traitor asked , " It is not I , Rabbi ? " Jesus replied , " It is you . "
40026026	While they were eating , Jesus took a loaf and blessed it and broke it and gave it to his disciples , saying , " Take this and eat it . This is my body . "
40026027	Then he took a cup , and after giving thanks gave it to them , saying , " Drink from it , all of you ;
40026028	for this is my blood of the covenant , which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you , new , in the kingdom of my Father . "
40026030	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , " All of you will stumble and fail me to-night ; for it is written , ' I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . '
40026032	But after I am raised , I will precede you to Galilee . "
40026033	Peter answered him , " Though all stumble and fail you , I never will stumble and fail . "
40026034	Jesus said to him , " I tell you truly that to-night , before the cock crows , you will disown me three times . "
40026035	Peter said to him , " Even if I have to die with you , I will not disown you . " And so said all of the disciples .
40026036	Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane , and said to the disciples , " Sit here while I go and pray yonder . "
40026037	He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be grieved and distressed .
40026038	He said to them , " My soul is exceedingly sad , even to death . Stay here and watch with me . "
40026039	Then he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed , " My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass from me . Yet not as I will , but as thou wilt . "
40026040	Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " So you could not watch one hour with me !
40026041	Watch and pray so as not to enter into temptation . Your spirit is eager , but your flesh is weak . "
40026042	Again a second time he went away and prayed , " My Father , if this cannot pass unless I drink it , thy will be done . "
40026043	He came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
40026044	So he left them and went away again and prayed a third time , saying again the same words .
40026045	Then he came to the disciples and said to them , " You are sleeping on and resting ! Now has come the hour when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Up , let us be going . Here comes my betrayer . "
40026047	While he was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , came and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs , sent by the high priests and elders of the people .
40026048	The traitor had given them a sign , saying , " The one I kiss is he . Arrest him . "
40026049	Immediately he came up to Jesus and said , " Good evening , Rabbi , " and kissed him affectionately .
40026050	Jesus said to him , " Friend , do what you are here for . " Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus and arrested him .
40026051	Suddenly one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the High Priest , cutting off his ear .
40026052	Jesus said to him , " Put your sword back into its place , for all who take the sword will perish by the sword .
40026053	Do you think that I cannot call on my Father and have him send to me now more than twelve legions of angels ?
40026054	But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that so it must be ? "
40026055	Jesus said to the crowd , " Have you come out to seize me as if against a robber , with swords and clubs ? Every day I sat in the Temple teaching and you did not arrest me .
40026056	But all this has happened that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled . " Then all the disciples left him and fled .
40026057	The men who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the High Priest , at whose house the scribes and elders had assembled .
40026058	Peter followed him at a distance as far as the court of the High Priest , and went in and sat among the attendants to see the end .
40026059	The high priests and the whole council sought for false testimony against Jesus , so that they might put him to death .
40026060	But they did not find any , although many false witnesses came . Finally , two came forward
40026061	and said , " This man said , ' I can pull down the Temple of God and in three days build it up again . ' "
40026062	The High Priest rose and said to him , " Have you no answer ? What is it that these are testifying to against you ? "
40026063	But Jesus kept silence . The High Priest said to him , " I adjure you by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ , the Son of God . "
40026064	Jesus said to him , " I am he . But I tell you , hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven . "
40026065	Then the High Priest rent his garments , saying , " Impious words ! Why do we any longer need witnesses ? See , you have now heard his impious words .
40026066	What do you think ? " They answered , " He deserves death . "
40026067	Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists . Some slapped him ,
40026068	saying , " Act the prophet for us , you Christ ! Who was it that struck you ? "
40026069	Peter was sitting outside in the court . A maid came up to him and said , " You too were with Jesus the Galilaean . "
40026070	But he denied it before all , saying , " I do not know what you mean . "
40026071	When he had gone out into the gateway , another maid saw him and said to those who were there , " This man was with Jesus the Nazarene . "
40026072	Then again he denied with an oath , " I do not know the man . "
40026073	After a little those who were standing there came up and said to Peter , " Truly you are one of them , for your accent proves it . "
40026074	Then he began to curse and swear , " I do not know the man . " Immediately the cock crew , and
40026075	Peter remembered what Jesus had said , " Before the cock crows you will disown me three times , " and he went out and wept bitterly .
40027001	WHEN morning came all the high priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put him to death .
40027002	After binding him , they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the Governor .
40027003	Then Judas , who had betrayed him , when he saw that Jesus had been condemned , was sorry and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the high priests and elders ,
40027004	saying , " I sinned in betraying innocent blood ! " But they said , " What is that to us ? You must see to that . "
40027005	Then throwing the silver into the Temple he left and went and hung himself .
40027006	The high priests took the money and said , " It is not proper to put it in with the consecrated gifts , since it is the price of blood . "
40027007	So after consultation they bought with it the potter's field for the burial of strangers .
40027008	For this reason that field is called the " Field of Blood " to this day .
40027009	Then was fulfilled what was said through Jeremiah the prophet , " And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him who was priced , whom they priced from the sons of Israel ,
40027010	and gave them for the potter's field , as the Lord commanded me . "
40027011	Jesus stood before the Governor . The Governor asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " Jesus said , " I am . "
40027012	While he was being accused by the high priests and elders , he answered nothing .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , " Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you ? "
40027014	But Jesus did not answer even one word , so that the Governor was much astonished .
40027015	At every feast the Governor was accustomed to release for the people one prisoner , whomever they chose .
40027016	There was at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas .
40027017	So , when they had gathered , Pilate said to them , " Whom do you want me to release for you , Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ? "
40027018	For he knew that out of jealousy they had handed him over .
40027019	While he was sitting on the judge's seat , his wife sent to him a message , " Do not have anything to do with that righteous man . For I have suffered much to-day in a dream because of him . "
40027020	The high priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus .
40027021	The Governor said to them , " Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? " They said , " Barabbas . "
40027022	Pilate said to them , " What , then , shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? " They all said , " Have him crucified . "
40027023	He said , " Why , what wrong has he done ? " But they kept shouting furiously , " Have him crucified ! "
40027024	When Pilate saw that he was doing no good , but rather that an uproar was arising , he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd and said , " I am innocent of this blood . You will have to see to it . "
40027025	All the people answered , " His blood be on us and on our children ! "
40027026	Then he released Barabbas for them , but scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified .
40027027	Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus with them into the castle and gathered about him all the battalion .
40027028	They stripped him and put on him a crimson cloak ,
40027029	twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head , put a reed into his right hand , and , going down on their knees before him , made sport of him , shouting , " Hail , King of the Jews ! "
40027030	They spit on him , and took the reed and struck him on the head .
40027031	After they had finished making sport of him , they took off from him the crimson cloak and put his own clothes on him , and led him away to crucifixion .
40027032	As they were going out , they chanced upon a man from Cyrene by the name of Simon . This man they impressed to carry the cross of Jesus .
40027033	On coming to a place called Golgotha ,
40027034	they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink . He tasted it and would not drink it .
40027035	When they had crucified him , they divided his clothes by casting lots .
40027036	Then they sat and kept watch over him there .
40027037	Above his head they put up the charge against him in writing : THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS
40027038	At the same time there were crucified along with him two robbers , one on his right and one on his left .
40027039	The people who went by insulted him , shaking their heads
40027040	and saying , " You who can pull down the Temple and in three days build it up , save yourself ! If you are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! "
40027041	In the same way the high priests , making sport of him , along with the scribes and elders , kept saying ,
40027042	" He saved others ; he cannot save himself . He is the King of Israel ; let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusted in God , let him deliver him now if he wants him , for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
40027044	In the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him insulted him .
40027045	From noon darkness came over all the land until three o'clock .
40027046	About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice , " Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? " that is , " My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? "
40027047	Some of those who were standing there said , when they heard it , " This man is calling for Elijah . "
40027048	Immediately one of them took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink .
40027049	The rest said , " Let him alone , let us see whether Elijah comes to save him . "
40027050	But Jesus , after calling out again with a loud voice , gave up his spirit .
40027051	Suddenly the curtain of the Temple was rent in two from top to bottom . The earth quaked . The rocks were split ,
40027052	and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the sleeping saints arose ,
40027053	and , coming out of the tombs after his resurrection , they entered into the holy city and appeared to many .
40027054	The Centurion and his men who were guarding Jesus , when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened , were greatly terrified and said , " Truly this man was a son of God ! "
40027055	Looking on from a distance , were many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee , waiting upon him .
40027056	Among them were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
40027057	In the late afternoon there came a rich man of Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus , and Pilate ordered it to be given to him .
40027059	Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet
40027060	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn in the rock . Then he rolled a great stone up to the door of the tomb and went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene remained there and the other Mary , sitting opposite the tomb .
40027062	On the next day , that is , the day after the Preparation , the high priests and the Pharisees gathered about Pilate
40027063	and said , " Sir , we remember that that deceiver said while he was alive , ' After three days I shall be raised up . '
40027064	So give orders to have the tomb guarded until the third day . Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him away and tell the people , ' He has been raised from the dead , ' and the last error will be worse than the first . "
40027065	Pilate said to them , " You may have a guard . Go make it as secure as you know how . "
40027066	They went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone as well as setting a watch .
40028001	LATE on the Sabbath , as the first day of the week was drawing near , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb .
40028002	And suddenly there was a great earthquake . For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to the stone and rolled it away and sat upon it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow .
40028004	For fear of him the guards trembled violently and became like dead men .
40028005	The angel said to the women , " Do not you be afraid . For I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here . He has been raised , as he told you . Come see the place where he lay .
40028007	Go quickly and tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead . He will precede you to Galilee . There you will see him . See , I have told you . "
40028008	They left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	Suddenly Jesus met them and said , " Hail ! " They came up and clasped his feet and bowed down before him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , " Do not be afraid . Go and take the message to my disciples to go away to Galilee and there they will see me . "
40028011	While they were going , some of the guard came into the city and brought word to the high priests of all that had happened .
40028012	After assembling with the elders and holding a consultation , they gave a good deal of money to the soldiers
40028013	and said , " Say , ' His disciples came in the night and stole him away while we were asleep , '
40028014	and if this comes to the ears of the Governor we will persuade him and free you from trouble . "
40028015	The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed . And this report has been spread among the Jews to this day .
40028016	The eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had appointed to meet them ,
40028017	and they saw him and bowed down before him ; but some doubted .
40028018	Jesus came to them and talked with them . He said , " To me has been given all authority in heaven and on earth .
40028019	Go , therefore , and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to keep all the commands that I have given you . And , behold , I am with you all the days to the end of the world . "
41001001	THE Beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ .
41001002	It is written in Isaiah the prophet , " Behold , I am sending my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way .
41001003	The voice of one crying in the wilderness , ' Make ready the way of the Lord ; make his paths straight ' " ;
41001004	just so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness , preaching the baptism of a change of heart for forgiveness of sins .
41001005	All the land of Judaea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan river , confessing their sins .
41001006	John's clothes were of camel's hair and he had a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	He proclaimed , " One is coming after me who is more powerful than I , the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop and loose .
41001008	I have baptized you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . "
41001009	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee , and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	Immediately as he was coming up from the water he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him .
41001011	And there was a voice from the heavens , " Thou art my Son , my Beloved ; in thee I am well pleased . "
41001012	Immediately the spirit impelled him to go out into the wild lands .
41001013	And he was in the wild lands forty days , tempted by Satan . There he was among the wild beasts , but angels waited upon him .
41001014	After John had been betrayed , Jesus came into Galilee , proclaiming the good news of God
41001015	and saying , " The time has been completed and the kingdom of God is at hand . Repent and believe the good news . "
41001016	As he passed along by the lake of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew , casting a net into the lake , for they were fishermen .
41001017	Jesus said to them , " Follow me and I will make you fishers of men . "
41001018	They immediately left their nets and followed him .
41001019	Going on a little farther , he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat , mending their net .
41001020	Immediately he called them . They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him away .
41001021	They came into Capernaum . Immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and taught .
41001022	The people were astonished at his teaching , for he taught them as if he had authority , and not as the scribes .
41001023	There was in their synagogue a man wider the power of an impure spirit , and he immediately cried out ,
41001024	" What have you to do with us , Nazarene Jesus ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy one of God . "
41001025	But Jesus reproved him and said , " Be still , and come out of him . "
41001026	Then the impure spirit convulsed him , and screamed loudly and came out .
41001027	They were all amazed so that they discussed together , " What is this ? A new powerful teaching ! He commands even the impure spirits and they obey him ! "
41001028	So reports about him immediately spread everywhere through the whole region of Galilee .
41001029	As soon as they had come out of the synagogue , they entered the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
41001030	The mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with fever . Immediately they told him about her .
41001031	He came to her , and took her by the hand and lifted her up . The fever left her and she waited on them .
41001032	When evening came and the sun had set , they brought to him all the sick and those who were afflicted with demons ;
41001033	and the whole city was gathered before the door .
41001034	He healed many who were sick with various diseases , and cast out many demons , not allowing the demons to talk , because they knew him .
41001035	Early in the morning , while it was still night , he rose and went out , and went away into a solitary place and there prayed .
41001036	Simon and his companions searched for him ,
41001037	and when they found him they said to him , " All are looking for you ?
41001038	But he said to them , " Let us go somewhere else among the neighboring villages , so that I may preach there too ; for it was for this purpose that I came away . "
41001039	And he went through all Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons .
41001040	There came to him a leper , begging him and kneeling to him and saying , " If you will , you can cleanse me . "
41001041	He had compassion on him , and stretched out his hand and touched him , and said , " I do will it ; be cleansed . "
41001042	Immediately the leprosy left him and he became clean .
41001043	Then Jesus sent him away after strictly charging him ,
41001044	" Be sure , do not say anything to anybody , but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed for evidence . "
41001045	But the man went away and began to proclaim freely and to spread the report , so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into any city , but stayed out in the wild country , and people came to him from every direction .
41002001	HE came again into Capernaum , and after some days it was heard that he was in the house .
41002002	Many came together , so that there was no longer room even near the door , and he preached to them .
41002003	Then some people came bringing to him a paralytic , borne by four .
41002004	Not being able to bring him near , owing to the crowd , they opened the roof where he was , and when they had broken through it , they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying .
41002005	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , " Son , your sins are forgiven . "
41002006	There were some of the scribes sitting there and debating in their minds ,
41002007	" Why does this man talk so ? He speaks profane words . Who except God can forgive sins ? "
41002008	Immediately Jesus , perceiving that they were inwardly reasoning in this way , said to them , " Why do you reason so in your minds ?
41002009	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Rise , take up your pallet and walk ' ?
41002010	But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins , " turning to the paralytic he said ,
41002011	" I tell you , Rise , take up your pallet and go to your house . "
41002012	Immediately the man rose and took up his pallet and went out before all , so that they were astounded and gave praise to God , saying , " We have never seen anything like this ! "
41002013	Jesus went out again beside the lake , and all the crowd came to him and he taught them .
41002014	As he was passing along , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting at the tax office and said to him , " Follow me . " He arose and followed .
41002015	Jesus was reclining at table in Levi's house , and many tax collectors and sinners also reclined at table along with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many who followed him .
41002016	When the scribes and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors , they said to his disciples , " Can it be that he eats with tax collectors and sinners ? "
41002017	When Jesus heard it , he said to them , " The strong have no need of a physician , but the sick have . I did not come to call righteous men , but sinners . "
41002018	The disciples of John as well as the Pharisees were fasting . They came and said to Jesus , " Why is it that the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting , but your disciples are not fasting ? "
41002019	Jesus replied , " Can guests at a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
41002020	But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and then they will fast , in those days .
41002021	No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old coat . For the patch will break away , the new from the old , and a worse tear will be made .
41002022	No one pours new wine into old wine-skins . For the wine will burst the skins , and both wine and skins will be lost . "
41002023	It happened on a Sabbath day that he was passing through the grainfields , and his disciples began , as they walked , to pluck the heads of grain .
41002024	The Pharisees said to him , " See what they are doing on the Sabbath — something that is not allowable . "
41002025	He said to them , " Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry , he and his companions ? —
41002026	how he went into the house of God , when Abiathar was High Priest , and ate the consecrated loaves , which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat , and gave them also to his companions ? "
41002027	He said to them , " The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath ;
41002028	so the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath . "
41003001	HE went another time into the synagogue and there was present a man with a withered hand .
41003002	They watched him to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath , so that they might have something to say against him .
41003003	He said to the man with the withered hand , " Stand up in the center . "
41003004	Then he said to them , " Is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm , to save a life or to kill ? " But they kept silent .
41003005	He looked round on them with anger , grieved at the hardness of their hearts , and said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He stretched the hand out and it was completely restored .
41003006	The Pharisees went out immediately and joined with the Herodians in a plot to put him out of the way .
41003007	Then Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake and a great number from Galilee followed him . Also from Judaea
41003008	and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon , a great number , hearing of all that he was doing , came to him .
41003009	Jesus spoke to his disciples to have a little boat ready for his use on account of the throng , to prevent them from pressing upon him .
41003010	For he healed many , so that all that had diseases crowded around him to touch him .
41003011	The impure spirits , also , when they saw him , fell down before him and shouted , " You are the Son of God . "
41003012	But he ordered them repeatedly and sternly not to make him known .
41003013	Jesus went up on the mountain and invited whom he chose , and they came to him .
41003014	He appointed twelve who should be with him and whom he could send out to preach
41003015	and to have authority to cast out demons .
41003016	He appointed these twelve : Simon , to whom he gave the name Peter ,
41003017	James the son of Zebedee and John his brother , to whom he gave the name Boanerges , which means Sons of Thunder ,
41003018	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddeus , Simon the Zealot ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him . Jesus came into a house
41003020	and the crowd gathered again so that they were not able even to eat bread .
41003021	When his family heard of it , they went out to take him by force , for they said , " He is out of his mind . "
41003022	The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying , " He has Beelzebul in him , and by the Chief of the demons he casts out demons . "
41003023	Jesus called them to him and said to them in figures : " How can Satan cast out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
41003025	And if a house divides against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
41003026	So if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided , he cannot stand , but has an end .
41003027	No one can enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man , and then he can plunder his house .
41003028	Truly I tell you all sins will be forgiven to the sons of men and all their profane words , whatever they may say ,
41003029	but whoever speaks profane words against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever , but is guilty of an eternal sin . "
41003030	This he said because they said , " He has an impure spirit . "
41003031	Then came his mother and his brothers , and standing outside sent and called him out .
41003032	A crowd was sitting around him when some one said to him , " Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want you . "
41003033	But he answered , " Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? "
41003034	Looking round at those sitting in the circle about him he said , " Here are my mother and my brothers .
41003035	Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother . "
41004001	AGAIN Jesus began to teach beside the lake , and a very great crowd gathered around him , so that he got into a boat on the lake and sat down , and all the crowd was on the shore near the lake .
41004002	He taught them many things by figures of speech . He said to them in his teaching ,
41004003	" Listen ; a sower went out to sow ,
41004004	and it happened , as he was sowing , that some seed fell beside the road and the birds came and ate it .
41004005	Other seed fell on stony places where it had not much earth , and it sprang up at once because it had no depth of soil ,
41004006	but when the sun came up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away .
41004007	Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain .
41004008	Other seed fell into good ground and grew tall and strong and yielded thirty , sixty , or a hundred fold . "
41004009	He said to them , " Let him who has ears to hear with hear . "
41004010	When he was alone , his close friends and the twelve asked him about the illustrations .
41004011	He replied , " To you the mystery of the kingdom of God has been confided . But to outsiders all things come in figures of speech
41004012	so that they may look straight and yet not see , and hear plainly , yet not understand , and thus they will never repent and be forgiven . "
41004013	He said to them , " Do you not understand this illustration ? How , then , will you understand all the illustrations ?
41004014	The sower sows the word .
41004015	These are those in whom the message is sown by the roadside — such as hear , but immediately Satan comes and takes away the message that was sown in their minds .
41004016	These are they likewise who received seed on stony places — such as hear and immediately and gladly receive the word ,
41004017	but , since they have no root , but are fickle , whenever trouble or persecution arises on account of the word , immediately they fail .
41004018	Others are those who receive seed among thorns — such as hear the word ,
41004019	but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the passions for other things come in and choke the word , and it turns out barren .
41004020	These are those who received seed in good ground — such as hear the message and receive it and yield thirty , sixty , or a hundred fold . "
41004021	He said to them , " A light is not brought in to be put under a peck-measure or under a bed , is it ? Is it not brought to be placed on the stand ?
41004022	For there is nothing hidden except to be manifested ; nor was anything made secret except to come to light .
41004023	If any one has ears to hear with , let him hear . "
41004024	He said again to them , " Be careful what you hear . With the measure that you measure with , it will be measured to you , and more will be given you .
41004025	For to him who has will be given , and from him who has not , even what he has will be taken . "
41004026	He said again , " The kingdom of God is like this : A man casts seed on the ground
41004027	and goes on sleeping by night and rising by day , and the seed sprouts and grows up , he knows not how .
41004028	The ground of itself yields fruit : first the stalk , then the ear , then comes the full grain in the ear .
41004029	When the grain is ripe immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest has come . "
41004030	Again he said , " With what shall we compare the kingdom of God ? or by what figure can we illustrate it ?
41004031	It is like a mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the ground , although it is the least of all the seeds that are in the ground ,
41004032	yet grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs , and puts out great branches so that the birds of the air can find shelter under its shadow . "
41004033	With many such illustrations he went on talking to them as they were able to listen ;
41004034	but except in figures of speech he did not talk to them . Privately to his own disciples he explained all things .
41004035	On that day when evening came he said to them , " Let us cross over to the other side . "
41004036	So they left the crowd and took him along just as he was , in the boat . There were also other boats with them .
41004037	Then a heavy squall of wind came up and the waves beat into the boat so that it was filling .
41004038	But he was in the stern asleep on the cushion . They aroused him and said to him , " Teacher , do you not care that we are sinking ? "
41004039	When he awoke , he rebuked the wind and said to the sea , " Hush , be still . " The wind ceased and there was a great calm .
41004040	Then he asked them , " Why are you so timid ? How is it you have no faith ? "
41004041	But they were intensely awestruck and said to one another , " Who , then , is this , that even the wind and the lake obey him ? "
41005001	THEY came to the other side of the lake , to the land of the Gerasenes .
41005002	When he got out of the boat , immediately there came out of the tombs to meet him a man under the power of an impure spirit .
41005003	This man made his dwelling in the tombs , and nobody could bind him even with a chain ,
41005004	because he had often been bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart and the fetters broken in pieces by him , and no one was strong enough to tame him .
41005005	All night and all day long he was in the tombs and in the mountains , shrieking and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	When he saw Jesus a long way off , he ran and knelt to him
41005007	and shouted with a loud voice , " What have I and you to do with each other , Jesus , Son of God most high ? I adjure you by God , not to torment me . "
41005008	For Jesus had said to him , " Come out from the man , you impure spirit . "
41005009	Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " He replied , " Legion is my name , for we are many . "
41005010	Then he begged Jesus earnestly not to send them out of the country .
41005011	There was on the mountain-side a great herd of swine feeding ,
41005012	and the demons begged him , " Send us to the swine and let us go into them . "
41005013	He consented . The impure spirits came out of the man and entered into the swine . Then the herd , numbering about two thousand , rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned in the lake .
41005014	At this , those who were feeding them fled and told it in the city and in the fields , and people came to see what had happened .
41005015	When they came to Jesus , they saw the demoniac , the man who had had the legion , sitting there clothed and in his right mind . They were struck with awe .
41005016	Those who had seen it told them about what had happened to the demoniac and about the swine .
41005017	Then they began to beg him to go away from their neighborhood .
41005018	As Jesus was entering the boat , the man who had been demoniac begged him to let him stay with him .
41005019	He , however , did not consent , but said , " Go to your own house and to your family , and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you . "
41005020	So he went away and began to make known in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him ; and all were astonished .
41005021	When Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side of the lake , a great crowd gathered around him as he stood on the shore .
41005022	Then came one of the directors of the synagogue , by the name of Jairus , and as soon as he saw Jesus he fell at his feet
41005023	and pleaded with him earnestly , saying , " My little daughter is near to death . I beg you to come and lay your hands on her so that she may be saved and live . "
41005024	Jesus went away with him and a great crowd followed and pressed upon him .
41005025	There was a woman who had for twelve years had a hemorrhage
41005026	and had suffered much under the treatment of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , though without becoming better , but rather worse ;
41005027	this woman had heard about Jesus , and she came in the crowd behind him and touched his cloak ,
41005028	for she said , " If I can touch even his clothes , I shall be healed . "
41005029	Immediately the hemorrhage ceased and she knew in her body that she was healed of her affliction .
41005030	Jesus was at once conscious that power had gone from him , and turned in the crowd and said , " Who touched my clothes ? "
41005031	His disciples replied , " You see the people crowding you , and do you ask , ' Who touched me ? '
41005032	But he looked around to see who had done it .
41005033	Then the woman , afraid and trembling , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell before him and told him all the truth .
41005034	He said to her , " Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace and be well of your trouble . "
41005035	While he was still speaking , people came from the house of the synagogue Director and told him , " Your daughter is dead ; why annoy the teacher any longer ? "
41005036	But Jesus , overhearing what they were saying , said to the Director , " Never fear ; only believe . "
41005037	He did not permit any one to accompany him except Peter and James and John , the brother of James .
41005038	When they approached the Director's house , they saw a noisy crowd weeping loudly and wailing .
41005039	He entered and said , " Why are you making so much noise and weeping so ? The child is not dead , but is sleeping . "
41005040	But they laughed at him . Then he put them all out and took the child's father and mother and his own companions and went in where the child was .
41005041	Taking hold of the child's hand he said to her , " Talitha koum , " which means , " Little girl , rise up . "
41005042	Immediately the little girl rose up and walked around . She was twelve years old . They were utterly amazed .
41005043	But he strictly ordered that no one should know it , and told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	LEAVING there , he came to his own native place accompanied by his disciples .
41006002	When the Sabbath came , he began teaching in the synagogue . Many who heard were astonished and said , " Where did he get this , and what is this wisdom with which he is gifted ? How are such deeds of power done by his hands ?
41006003	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon ? And are not his sisters here with us ? " So they fell into mistake regarding him .
41006004	But Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor except in his own native place and among his own kindred and in his own home . "
41006005	There he was unable to do any work of power , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them .
41006006	Their lack of faith astonished him . He made a circuit through the villages , teaching .
41006007	Then he called together the twelve and began to send them out two by two , and gave them authority over impure spirits ,
41006008	and instructed them not to take anything for their journey but just a stick ; no bread , no bag , no coppers in their belts ,
41006009	to be shod with sandals , and not to have two tunics .
41006010	He said to them , " Wherever you enter a house , stay there until you leave the place .
41006011	Wherever the people will not receive you or listen to you , when you leave shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them . "
41006012	They went out and proclaimed that men should repent ,
41006013	and they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many sick people and healed them .
41006014	The name of Jesus was so much talked about that King Herod heard of it . Some were saying , " John the Baptizer has risen from the dead , and therefore these mighty works are done by him . "
41006015	Others said , " It is Elijah , " and others said , " It is a prophet like one of the old prophets . "
41006016	But Herod , when he heard about him , said , " John , the man whom I beheaded , has risen again . "
41006017	Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife , whom he had married .
41006018	For John had said to Herod , " It is not right for you to have your brother's wife . "
41006019	Herodias hated him and wished to kill him , but was unable to do so ,
41006020	because Herod reverenced John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and he protected him . When Herod heard John , he was much perplexed , and yet he was glad to listen to him .
41006021	But an opportunity came for Herodias when Herod , on his birthday , gave a feast to his high officials and military officers and the leading men of Galilee .
41006022	Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and his guests . The King said to the girl , " Ask me for whatever you will and I will give it to you . "
41006023	He swore , " Whatever you ask I will give you , up to the half of my kingdom . "
41006024	The girl went out and said to her mother , " What shall I ask ? " She replied , " The head of John the Baptizer . "
41006025	The girl immediately hurried in and said to the King , " I choose to have you give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter . "
41006026	This made the King very sorry , but on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to refuse her .
41006027	So he immediately sent one of the guardsmen with orders to bring John's head . The soldier went and beheaded him in the prison
41006028	and brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
41006029	When John's disciples heard about it , they came and took the body and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles gathered back to Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and all that they had taught .
41006031	He said to them , " Come away alone into some solitary place and rest a little . " For there were many people coming and going , and they had no time even to eat .
41006032	So they put off in a boat for an uninhabited , solitary place .
41006033	But many saw them going and recognized them , and ran together by land from all the towns and got there before them .
41006034	When Jesus landed , he saw a great crowd , and he was filled with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd , and he began and taught them many things .
41006035	By this time it was late in the day , and his disciples came to him and said , " This is an uninhabited place and the hour is already late .
41006036	Send them away so that they can go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat . "
41006037	But Jesus answered , " Give them something to eat yourselves . " They said , " Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings worth of bread and feed them ? "
41006038	He asked , " How many loaves have you ? Go and see . " When they had ascertained they said , " Five , and there are two fishes . "
41006039	Then he told them to have all the people recline in groups on the green grass .
41006040	They lay down in rows by hundreds and by fifties .
41006041	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looked up to heaven and blessed them , and broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people . The two fishes he also divided among all .
41006042	All ate and had abundance ,
41006043	and they picked up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces of the bread , besides portions of the fishes .
41006044	There were five thousand men who ate of the loaves .
41006045	Jesus immediately had his disciples get into the boat and cross before him to Bethsaida while he was dismissing the crowd .
41006046	After taking leave of them , he went away up the mountain to pray .
41006047	When evening had fallen , the boat was half across the lake and he was alone on the land .
41006048	He saw them distressed in rowing , for the wind was against them . About the fourth watch of the night , he came to them walking on the lake and he seemed to be going past them .
41006049	But when they saw him walking on the lake , they thought that it was a ghost and cried out .
41006050	For they all saw him and were frightened . But he immediately spoke to them and said , " Courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid . "
41006051	Then he got into the boat with them and the wind dropped . They were in boundless amazement ;
41006052	for they had not grasped the miracle of the loaves because their minds were dull .
41006053	When they had crossed to the land they came to Gennesaret and dropped anchor .
41006054	As soon as they got out of the boat , the people recognized Jesus
41006055	and hurried over all that region and brought in the sick on pallets wherever they heard that he was .
41006056	Whenever he went into villages or towns or among the farms they would lay the sick in the streets and beg him to let them touch at least the tassel of his cloak . And all who touched were healed .
41007001	ONCE the Pharisees gathered about him with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem ,
41007002	and they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with " common , " that is , unwashed , hands .
41007003	For the Pharisees and all the Jews never eat without first washing their hands up to the wrist , holding faithfully to the tradition of their forefathers ,
41007004	and when they return from market they do not eat until they have washed . There are also many other traditions which they have been taught to hold tenaciously , such as washing cups and pitchers and copper vessels .
41007005	The Pharisees and scribes asked him , " Why do not your disciples live according to the tradition of our fore-fathers ? Why do they eat their bread with common hands ? "
41007006	He replied , " Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites when he wrote : ' This people honor me with their lips , but their heart is far from me ;
41007007	in vain they worship me , while they teach what are merely commandments of men . '
41007008	Neglecting the commands of God , you hold firmly to the traditions of men . "
41007009	He said further to them , " How thoroughly you set aside the command of God so that you may keep your tradition !
41007010	For Moses said , ' Honor thy father and thy mother , ' and , ' He who speaks evil of father or mother must surely die . '
41007011	But you say , ' If a man says to his father or his mother , Whatever benefit you enjoy from me is now Korban , that is , a gift to God , ' —
41007012	you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother ,
41007013	thus nullifying the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down ; and many similar things you do . "
41007014	Then , calling the crowd to him again , he said to them , " Hear me , all of you , and understand .
41007015	There is nothing from outside a man that can go into him and defile him , but the things that come out of the man are the things that defile the man . "
41007017	After he had gone into the house , his disciples asked about his figurative language .
41007018	He said , " Are you too so lacking in insight ? Do you not know that everything from outside that goes into a man is unable to defile him ,
41007019	for it does not go into his heart , but into his stomach and passes out into the sewer ? " Thus he pronounced all foods clean .
41007020	" But , " he said , " what comes out of a man is what defiles him ;
41007021	for from within , out of the hearts of men , come evil thoughts , unchastities , thefts , murders ,
41007022	adulteries , lusts , wickednesses , deceit , sensuality , an evil eye , slander , arrogance , recklessness —
41007023	all these had things come out from within , and they defile the man . "
41007024	Leaving that place , Jesus went into the borders of Tyre . He entered a house and did not wish any one to know it , but he could not escape notice .
41007025	At once a woman whose daughter was afflicted by an impure spirit heard about him , and she came and fell at his feet .
41007026	The woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	But he said , " Let the children be well fed first . For it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs . "
41007028	She answered , " Yes , Sir , even the dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs . "
41007029	Then he said to her , " For this answer , go . The demon has gone out of your daughter . "
41007030	She returned to her house and found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone .
41007031	Again leaving the region of Tyre , he came through Sidon to the lake of Galilee into the midst of the region of Decapolis .
41007032	They brought to him a deaf man who stammered , and begged him to lay his hand on him .
41007033	He took him aside from the crowd , put his fingers into his ears , and touched his tongue with spit .
41007034	Then looking up to heaven , he sighed and said , " Ephphatha " that is , Be opened ,
41007035	and his ears were opened , and immediately his tongue was freed and he talked plainly .
41007036	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell any one . But the more he forbade them the more widely they spread it ,
41007037	for they were astonished beyond all bounds and said , " He has done everything well . He makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak . "
41008001	IN those days , when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called together his disciples and said to them ,
41008002	" I have compassion on the crowd because they have already spent three days with me and they have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them home hungry , they will faint on the way . Some of them are from a long way off . "
41008004	His disciples answered , " Where will any one be able to get bread to supply these people here in the uninhabited country ? "
41008005	He asked them , " How many loaves have you ? " They said , " Seven . "
41008006	He told the people to recline on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves and , after giving thanks , broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute , and they distributed to the people .
41008007	They had also a few small fishes . These he blessed and told the disciples to distribute them .
41008008	All ate and were satisfied , and they picked up of the fragments that were left over seven basketfuls .
41008009	There were about four thousand men . Then he dismissed them .
41008010	At once he got into a boat with the disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him , asking him for a sign from heaven , in order to test him .
41008012	He sighed deeply and said , " Why does this generation ask for a sign ? In truth I tell you no sign will be given to this generation . "
41008013	Then he left them and got into the boat again and went away across the lake .
41008014	They had forgotten to take bread , and except one loaf they had none with them in the boat .
41008015	Jesus warned them , " Beware , be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod . "
41008016	They began to talk among themselves about their lack of bread .
41008017	He perceived it , and said to them , " Why are you talking about your lack of bread ? Do you not yet know or understand ? Have you dull minds ?
41008018	You have eyes ; can you not see ? You have ears ; can you not hear ? Do you not remember
41008019	when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many basketfuls of fragments you picked up ? " They said , " Twelve . "
41008020	" And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand how many basketfuls of fragments you picked up ? " They said , " Seven . "
41008021	He said , " Do you not understand even yet ? "
41008022	They came to Bethsaida . There some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him .
41008023	Taking hold of the blind man's hand , he led him out of the village . Then , after spitting in his eyes and laying his hands on him , he asked him , " Do you see anything ? "
41008024	He looked up and said , " I see the people ; I see them like trees , walking around . "
41008025	Again Jesus put his hand on his eyes , and he looked and was restored and saw everything clearly .
41008026	Then Jesus sent him away home , saying , " Do not go into the village . "
41008027	Jesus went away with his disciples to the villages round Caesarea Philippi . On the road he asked them , " Who do the people say that I am ? "
41008028	They replied , " Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; others say one of the prophets . "
41008029	He asked them , " But you , who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
41008030	He gave them strict orders not to tell any one about him .
41008031	Then he began and taught them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things , and to be rejected by the elders and the high priests and the scribes , and to be put to death , and after three days to rise again .
41008032	He spoke about this frankly . But Peter took him and began to reprove him .
41008033	He turned and looked at his disciples and reproved Peter with the words , " Get behind me , Satan . You are not thinking God's thoughts , but men's thoughts . "
41008034	Then he called the crowd along with his disciples and said to them , " If any one wishes to come after me , let him disown himself and take up his cross and follow me .
41008035	Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it ; but whoever loses his life for my sake and the sake of the good news will save it .
41008036	What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul ?
41008037	For what could a man give to buy back his soul ?
41008038	Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with his holy angels . "
41009001	HE said further to them , " I tell you truly that there are some of those who are standing here , who will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God already here in power . "
41009002	Six days later , Jesus took Peter and James and John and led them up a high mountain . They were all alone . There in their presence he became transfigured .
41009003	His clothes became dazzlingly white , with a whiteness that no bleacher on earth can impart .
41009004	Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them and conversed with Jesus .
41009005	Peter said to Jesus , " Rabbi , it is fine for us to be here . Let us make three tents , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
41009006	For he did not know what to say , they were so frightened .
41009007	Then a cloud overshadowed them and there came a voice out of the cloud , " This is my beloved son , hear him . "
41009008	Then suddenly as they looked around they no longer saw any one , but Jesus only , with themselves .
41009009	When they were descending the mountain , he told them not to tell any one what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41009010	This command they kept , but debated among themselves what the rising from the dead was .
41009011	They asked him , " Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? "
41009012	He said , " Elijah does come first and reforms everything . How is it written also of the Son of Man that he suffers many things and is treated with contempt ?
41009013	I tell you Elijah has already come , and they have done to him what they chose , just as it was written of him . "
41009014	When they came to his disciples , they saw a great crowd around them and scribes debating with them .
41009015	At once the whole crowd saw him and were amazed , and they ran to him and welcomed him .
41009016	He asked them , " What are you debating ? "
41009017	One of the crowd answered , " Teacher , I have brought my son to you . He has a dumb spirit ,
41009018	and whenever it attacks him it convulses him and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth . He is wasting away . I asked your disciples to cast it out , but they had not the power . "
41009019	Jesus answered , " O faithless generation ! how long must I be with you ? How long must I bear with you ? Bring him to me . "
41009020	They brought him to him . As soon as the spirit saw Jesus , he convulsed the boy so that he fell on the ground and rolled about , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked the father , " How long is it since this came on him ? " He said , " From early childhood .
41009022	Often it has thrown him into the fire or into the water to destroy him . But if you can do anything , have pity on us and help us . "
41009023	Jesus said , " ' If you can ' ! All things are possible for one who believes . "
41009024	At once the father of the child cried out , " I believe ; help my unbelief . "
41009025	Jesus saw that the crowd was rapidly increasing , so he rebuked the impure spirit with the words , " Deaf and dumb spirit , I command you to come out and never to enter him again . "
41009026	He screamed and convulsed the boy and came out . The boy looked like a corpse , so that most of them said , " He is dead . "
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him and he stood up .
41009028	After he had gone into the house , his disciples asked him privately , " Why were we not able to cast it out ? "
41009029	He said , " This kind cannot come out by any means except by prayer . "
41009030	After leaving there , they were passing through Galilee , and he did not wish any one to know it .
41009031	For he was teaching his disciples and telling them that the Son of Man would be betrayed into the hands of men and that they would kill him , and that three days after being killed he would rise .
41009032	But they did not understand what he said and were afraid to question him .
41009033	They came to Capernaum . After entering the house , Jesus asked them , " What were you discussing on the road ? "
41009034	They were silent , for on the road they had disputed among themselves which was the greatest .
41009035	Taking a seat he called the twelve , and said , " If any one wishes to be first , he must be the last of all and the servant of all . "
41009036	Then he took a little child and placed him in the midst of them , and , putting his arms around him , said ,
41009037	" Whoever receives one of such little children in my name receives me ; and whoever receives me receives not me , but him who sent me . "
41009038	John said to him , " Teacher , we saw a man casting out demons in your name — a man who does not follow us — and we told him not to do it , because he does not follow us . "
41009039	Jesus said , " Do not tell him not to do it . For no one who does a miracle in my name can quickly speak evil of me .
41009040	For whoever is not against us is for us .
41009041	For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ , I tell you truly that he will not miss his reward .
41009042	And whoever causes the fall of one of these little ones that believe , it would be better for him if , with a great millstone hung around his neck , he had been cast into the lake .
41009043	If your hand is a snare to you , cut it off . It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go away into Gehenna , into the unquenchable fire .
41009045	If your foot is a snare to you , cut it off . It is better for you to enter into life lame than with two feet to be cast into Gehenna .
41009047	If your eye is a snare to you , tear it out . It is better to enter into the kingdom of God one-eyed than with two eyes to be cast into Gehenna ,
41009048	where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched .
41009049	For every one will be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good , but if the salt loses its saltness , with what can you flavor it ? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another . "
41010001	STARTING from there , he came into the land of Judaea and beyond the Jordan . Again the people crowded to him , and again as usual he was teaching them .
41010002	Some Pharisees came up and asked him , " Is it right for a man to divorce his wife ? " They meant to catch him .
41010003	He answered , " What did Moses command you ? "
41010004	They said , " Moses permitted a husband to give a certificate of divorce and send his wife away . "
41010005	Jesus said to them , " Because of your hard-heartedness he wrote this law for you .
41010006	But from the beginning of the creation , ' male and female made he them . '
41010007	' Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother
41010008	and the two shall become one flesh . ' So they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	What therefore God has joined together , let not man put asunder . "
41010010	When they were in the house , his disciples asked him again about this .
41010011	He said to them , " Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
41010012	And if a wife divorces her husband and marries another she commits adultery . "
41010013	They were bringing little children to him to have him touch them , but his disciples rebuked them .
41010014	When Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said , " Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them ; for of such is the kingdom of God .
41010015	I tell you truly whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will not enter it . "
41010016	Then he took them into his arms and blessed them , putting his hands on them .
41010017	While he was going out into the road , a man came running and knelt before him and asked , " Good teacher , what shall I do to inherit life eternal ? "
41010018	Jesus said to him , " Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
41010019	You know the commandments : ' Do not murder , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honor thy father and thy mother . '
41010020	He answered , " Teacher , all these I have kept from my boyhood . "
41010021	Jesus looking at him loved him and said to him , " One thing you lack . Go sell all that you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come follow me . "
41010022	But his face darkened at that reply , and he went away grieved , for he had great possessions .
41010023	Then Jesus , looking around on his disciples , said , " With what difficulty will those who have wealth enter the kingdom of God ! "
41010024	The disciples were astonished at his words . Jesus spoke again and said , " Children , how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God . "
41010026	They were amazed beyond measure and said to one another , " Then who can be saved ? "
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , " With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God . "
41010028	Peter began , " Well , we have left everything and have followed you . "
41010029	Jesus said , " I tell you truly there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the good news ,
41010030	who will not receive a hundred fold more now in this time , houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions , and in the world to come life eternal .
41010031	But many who are first will be last and the last first . "
41010032	They were on the road going up to Jerusalem and Jesus was walking in advance . Astonishment fell on them , and those who were following were fearful . Then again he took aside the twelve and began and told them what was going to happen to him .
41010033	He said , " See , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered to the high priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles ,
41010034	and they will make sport of him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him . But after three days he will rise . "
41010035	James and John the sons of Zebedee came to him and said , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask you . "
41010036	He said , " What do you want me to do for you ? "
41010037	They said , " Grant that one of us may sit on your right hand and the other on your left hand in your glory . "
41010038	Jesus said to them , " You do not know what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
41010039	They said to him , " We can . " Jesus said , " The cup that I drink you will drink , and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ;
41010040	but to sit on my right or my left is not mine to give , but it will be for those for whom it has been prepared . "
41010041	When the ten heard about this , they became indignant at James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them to him and said , " You know that those who are thought to rule the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
41010043	It is not so among you . But whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant ,
41010044	and whoever of you wishes to be first shall be the slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many . "
41010046	They came to Jericho . As Jesus was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the roadside .
41010047	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out and say , " Son of David , Jesus , pity me ! "
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , " Call him . " They called the blind man , saying , " Courage ; rise up ; he is calling you . "
41010050	He , throwing aside his cloak , sprang up and came to Jesus .
41010051	Jesus said to him , " What do you want me to do for you ? " The blind man said , " Rabboni , I want to regain my sight . "
41010052	Jesus said , " Go . Your faith has healed you . " At once he could see and followed Jesus along the road .
41011001	WHEN they were approaching Jerusalem , near Bethphage and Bethany , on the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two of his disciples
41011002	and told them , " Go into the village across there , and immediately , as you enter , you will find a colt tied , upon which no man has ever yet sat . Untie him and bring him .
41011003	If anybody asks , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Master has need of him , ' and at once he will send him . "
41011004	They went and found the colt tied near the door outside in the street , and they untied him .
41011005	Some of those who were standing there said to them , " What are you doing , untying the colt ? "
41011006	They gave the reply that Jesus had told them to give , and the men let them take it .
41011007	They brought the colt to Jesus and threw upon it their cloaks and he mounted it .
41011008	Then many spread their cloaks in the road and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields .
41011009	Some went in front and some followed , shouting , " God save him ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ! God in highest heaven save him ! "
41011011	He entered Jerusalem and came into the Temple courts . After inspecting everything , because it was already late he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
41011012	On the next morning , after they had left Bethany , he was hungry ,
41011013	and seeing a fig tree at a distance in full leaf he went to it on the chance of finding something on it . But when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
41011014	Then he said to it , " Nevermore may any one eat fruit from you ! " And his disciples heard him .
41011015	They came to Jerusalem , and he went into the Temple courts and began to cast out those who were buying and selling there . He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of the dove-sellers ,
41011016	and would not allow any one to carry anything through the Temple courts ,
41011017	for he taught and said to them , " Is it not written , ' My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ' ? But you have made it a den of robbers . "
41011018	When the high priests and the scribes heard of this they tried to contrive to put him out of the way , for they were afraid of him because the people were deeply impressed by his teaching .
41011019	When evening came , Jesus and his disciples used to go out of the city .
41011020	As they were passing by early in the morning they saw the fig tree withered from the roots .
41011021	Peter , calling to mind , said to him , " Rabbi , see , the fig tree that you cursed has withered up . "
41011022	Jesus answered , " Have faith in God .
41011023	I tell you truly whoever says to this mountain , ' Be taken up and be cast into the sea , ' and does not doubt in his mind , but believes that what he says will be , will have it .
41011024	For this reason I say to you , all things whatever that you pray and ask for , believe that you have obtained them and you will have them .
41011025	And when you stand praying , forgive if you have anything against any one , so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your failings . "
41011027	They came again to Jerusalem , and as he was walking about in the Temple courts , the high priests and the scribes came to him
41011028	and said , " By what authority do you do these things ? Or who gave you authority to do them ? "
41011029	Jesus replied , " I will ask you one question ; answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
41011030	The baptism of John — was it from heaven or of men ? Answer me . "
41011031	But they discussed among themselves , " If we say ' From heaven , ' he will say , ' Then why did you not believe him ? '
41011032	But if we say , ' From men , ' — they feared the people , for all regarded John as really a prophet .
41011033	So they answered Jesus , " We do not know . " And he replied , " Neither will I tell you by what power I am doing these things . "
41012001	THEN he began to speak to them in figures : " There was a man who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug for a wine-vat , and built a tower and let it out to grape-growers , and then went abroad .
41012002	At the proper season he sent a servant to the grape-growers to receive from them some of the fruits of the vineyard .
41012003	But they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	Again he sent another servant to them , and him they beat over the head and insulted .
41012005	He sent another , and him they killed . He sent many others , some of whom were beaten and some killed .
41012006	He had still one , a beloved son . He sent him last to them , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
41012007	But those grape-growers said to one another , ' This is the heir . Come , let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours . '
41012008	Then they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	What will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the grape-growers and will give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Have you never read this Scripture , ' The stone which the builders despised has become the chief stone of the corner ;
41012011	this corner stone came from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes ' ? "
41012012	They kept trying to seize him , but were afraid of the crowd . For they knew that he had meant the illustration for them . So they left him and went away .
41012013	Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to entrap him in his talk .
41012014	When they came , they said to him , " Teacher , we know that you are true and are not afraid of any one ; for you do not look at the social standing of men , but you teach the way of God in truth . Is it right to pay tribute to Caesar or not ?
41012015	Shall we pay or shall we not pay ? " But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , " Why are you testing me ? Bring me a coin and let me see it . "
41012016	They brought one . Then he said , " Whose head is this and whose inscription ? " They said to him , " Caesar's . "
41012017	Jesus said to them , " Pay what is Caesar's to Caesar , and what is God's to God . " They were astonished at him .
41012018	Then there came to him some Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection . They asked him ,
41012019	" Teacher , Moses wrote a law for us that if any man's brother dies and leaves a wife , but no child , the brother shall take the wife and raise up off-spring for his brother .
41012020	Now there were seven brothers . The first took a wife and died leaving no child ,
41012021	then the second took her and died leaving no child , then the third likewise .
41012022	None of the seven left any child . Last of all the woman died also .
41012023	In the resurrection when they rise again whose wife will she be ? For the seven had her as wife . "
41012024	Jesus said to them , " Do you not err for the reason that you do not know either the Scriptures or the power of God ?
41012025	For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like the angels in heaven .
41012026	And concerning the dead , that they rise , have you not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the Bush , how God said to him , ' I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ' ?
41012027	He is not a God of dead men , but of living men . You are much mistaken . "
41012028	Then came one of the scribes , and , after listening to their discussion and knowing that he had answered them well , asked , " Which is the first commandment of all ? "
41012029	Jesus answered , " The first is , ' Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord ,
41012030	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength . '
41012031	This is the second , ' Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . ' There is no other commandment greater than these . "
41012032	The scribe said to him , " Right , teacher ; you have said truly that he is one and there is no other beside him ,
41012033	and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love one's neighbor as one's self is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
41012034	Jesus , seeing that he had answered with intelligence , said to him , " You are not far from the kingdom of God . " After that no one dared question him further .
41012035	Then Jesus asked , while teaching in the Temple courts , " How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
41012036	David himself , guided by the Holy Spirit , said , ' The Lord said to my Lord , sit at my right hand till I put your enemies under your feet . '
41012037	David himself called him ' Lord ' ; how is he then his son ? " A great crowd listened to him with delight .
41012038	In his teaching he said , " Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes and to have greetings in the market-places
41012039	and front seats in the synagogues and the best couches at banquets .
41012040	They eat up widows ' houses and hypocritically make long prayers . These men will receive a severer condemnation . "
41012041	Having seated himself across from the contribution box , he was watching how the crowd dropped money into the box . Many rich people were dropping in large gifts .
41012042	There came a poor widow and dropped in two mites , in value one penny .
41012043	Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them , " I tell you truly , this widow , poor as she is , has dropped in more than all the others who are dropping money into the contribution box .
41012044	For they all contributed out of their superfluity , but she out of her poverty dropped in all that she had — the whole of what she had to live on . "
41013001	AS he was going out of the Temple courts , one of his disciples said to him , " Teacher , see what great stones and what great buildings ! "
41013002	Jesus said to him , " Do you see these great buildings ? There will not be left one stone upon another which will not be thrown down . "
41013003	Then , when he was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the Temple buildings , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	" Tell us when these things will be , and what will be the sign when all these things are about to come to pass ? "
41013005	Jesus began and said to them : " See to it that no one misleads you .
41013006	Many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he , ' and they will deceive many .
41013007	And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed . These things must come , but the end is not yet .
41013008	For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places and there will be famines . These things are the beginning of birth-pangs .
41013009	But you , be on your guard . They will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in synagogues and you will have to stand before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony to them .
41013010	The good news must first be preached to all the nations .
41013011	When they are taking you along to deliver you up , feel no anxiety what you are to say , but say whatever is given to you in that hour . For it will not be you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	Brother will betray brother to death and father will betray child , and children will rise up against parents and put them to death .
41013013	You will be hated by all men for my name , but he who endures to the end , he will be saved .
41013014	" When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not Let the reader consider , then let those in Judea flee to the mountains ,
41013015	and let him who is on top of the house not descend and enter to take anything from his house ,
41013016	and let him who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak .
41013017	Alas for the women with child and the nursing mothers in those days !
41013018	Pray that it may not be in the winter .
41013019	For those will be days of misery such as has not been since the beginning of God's creation until now , and never will be again .
41013020	Unless the Lord had shortened those days , no human being would be saved . But for the sake of those whom he has chosen he has shortened the days .
41013021	Then if any one says to you , ' See here is the Christ ! ' or , ' See there , ' believe him not .
41013022	False Christs and false prophets will do signs and wonders to mislead if possible the chosen .
41013023	But you , be on your guard . I have foretold you all things .
41013024	" But in those days , after that misery , the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give her light
41013025	and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken .
41013026	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	Then he will send out his angels and will gather together his chosen from the four winds , from the farthest bound of earth to the farthest bound of heaven .
41013028	" From the fig tree learn a comparison . When once her branch becomes tender and puts out leaves , you know that summer is near .
41013029	So , when you see these things happening , know that he is nigh , yes , at the door .
41013030	I tell you truly that this generation will not pass away until all these things come to pass .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
41013032	" But of that day or that hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , not even the Son , but the Father only .
41013033	" Be watchful , be wakeful , for you do not know when the time is .
41013034	It is just as when a man going abroad leaves his house and gives to his servants authority and to each his work and commands the porter to watch .
41013035	Watch , therefore , for you do not know when the Master of the house will come , whether at evening or at midnight or at cock-crowing or in the morning .
41013036	Otherwise coming suddenly he may find you sleeping .
41013037	What I say to you , I say to all , Watch . "
41014001	THE Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were to come after two days . The high priests and the scribes were contriving how they might seize him by some stratagem and kill him .
41014002	For they said , " Not at the feast ; there might be a popular outbreak . "
41014003	During his stay in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper , while he was reclining at table there came a woman with an alabaster jar of pure nard perfume , very costly . She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head .
41014004	Some were indignant among themselves and said , " For what purpose was this waste of the perfume ?
41014005	This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor . " So they were indignant at her .
41014006	But Jesus said , " Let her alone . Why are you annoying her ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
41014007	The poor you have always with you , and whenever you will you can do them good , but me you have not always .
41014008	She has done what she could . She has anticipated the anointing of my body for burial .
41014009	I tell you truly wherever the good news shall be proclaimed over the whole world , what she has done will be told in memory of her . "
41014010	Then Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the high priests to betray him to them .
41014011	They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money . He meanwhile was contriving how he could betray him at some favorable time .
41014012	On the first day of unleavened bread — when they sacrificed the Passover lamb — his disciples said to him , " Where do you wish us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover ? "
41014013	So he sent two of his disciples , telling them , " Go into the city and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water ; follow him ,
41014014	and wherever he goes in , say to the householder , ' The Teacher says , Where is the guest room for me where I can eat the Passover with my disciples ? '
41014015	And he will show you a large upper room , furnished and ready . There prepare for us . "
41014016	The disciples went and entered the city and found everything as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
41014017	In the evening Jesus came with the twelve .
41014018	As they were reclining and eating , he said , " I tell you truly one of you will betray me , one who is now eating with me . "
41014019	They began to be sad and to say one to another , " It cannot be I ? "
41014020	He said , " It is one of the twelve , one who is dipping with me into the dish .
41014021	The Son of Man is going just as it has been written concerning him , but alas for that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! Well were it for that man if he had not been born ! "
41014022	While they were eating , he took a loaf and blessed it and broke it and gave to them , saying , " Take it ; this is my body . "
41014023	Then he took a cup , and after giving thanks he gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
41014024	He said to them , " This is my blood of the covenant which is shed for many .
41014025	I tell you truly I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God . "
41014026	After singing a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	Jesus said to them , " You will all fail , because it has been written , ' I will smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered abroad . '
41014028	But after I am raised up I will precede you into Galilee . "
41014029	Peter said to him , " Though all should fail , yet I will not . "
41014030	Jesus said to him , " I tell you truly that to-day , this very night , before the cock crows , you will three times disown me . "
41014031	But he kept saying more earnestly , " Though I have to die with you , I will not disown you . " Just so they all said .
41014032	They came to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to his disciples , " Sit here while I pray . "
41014033	He took Peter and James and John with him and began to be in terror and distress .
41014034	He said to them , " My soul is in anguish , to the point of death . Stay here and watch . "
41014035	Then he went forward a little and fell on the ground , and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him .
41014036	He said , " Abba , Father , all things are possible to thee . Take away this cup from me . Yet not what I will , but what thou wilt . "
41014037	Then he came and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " Simon , are you asleep ? Could you not watch one hour ?
41014038	Watch and pray that you may not fall into temptation . The spirit is eager , but the flesh is weak . "
41014039	Then he went away again and prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	Again he returned and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy . They did not know what to answer him .
41014041	He came back the third time and said to them , " Are you sleeping on ? Are you resting ? That is enough . The hour has come . Now the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of the sinners .
41014042	Rise , let us be going . See , my betrayer is at hand . "
41014043	Immediately , even while he was speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , was there and with him a crowd with swords and clubs . They had been sent by the high priests and the scribes and the elders .
41014044	The traitor had given them a sign , " The man I kiss , that is he . Seize him and take him safely away . "
41014045	So when he came , he immediately advanced to Jesus and said , " Rabbi , " and kissed him affectionately .
41014046	They laid their hands on him and held him .
41014047	But one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck a servant of the High Priest , cutting off his ear .
41014048	Jesus said to them , " Have you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as you would a robber ?
41014049	Every day I was with you in the Temple courts teaching and you did not lay hands on me . But this is so that the Scriptures may be fulfilled . "
41014050	Then all his friends left him and fled .
41014051	There was a young man following him who had thrown a linen cloth around his naked body . They seized him ,
41014052	but he left the linen cloth and fled naked .
41014053	They led Jesus away to the High Priest , and all the high priests and elders and scribes assembled .
41014054	Peter followed him at a distance and came inside the court of the High Priest and sat with the attendants , and warmed himself in the light of the fire .
41014055	The high priests and all the council tried to get testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death , but they could not find any .
41014056	Many bore false witness against him , but their testimony did not agree .
41014057	Then some rose and testified falsely against him ,
41014058	" We heard him say , ' I will destroy this Temple made by hands and in three days I will build another not made by hands . '
41014059	But their testimony did not agree even regarding this .
41014060	Then the High Priest rose and came forward into the midst and questioned Jesus , " Have you no answer ? What about this evidence against you ? "
41014061	But he was silent and did not answer a word . Again the High Priest questioned him , " Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? "
41014062	Jesus said , " I am , and you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven . "
41014063	Then the High Priest rent his garments and said , " Why do we any longer have need of witnesses ?
41014064	You have heard his impious words . How does it appear to you ? " They all condemned him as deserving of death .
41014065	Then some began to spit on him and to blindfold him and to strike him with their fists and say , " Prophesy , " and the attendants slapped him as they took him in charge .
41014066	While Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the maids of the High Priest came ,
41014067	and when she saw Peter warming himself she looked at him and said , " You too were with the Nazarene , this Jesus . "
41014068	But he denied it and said , " I do not know nor understand what you are saying . " Then he went out into the outer courtyard .
41014069	There the maid saw him and began again to say to those who stood around , " This man is one of them . "
41014070	But he again denied . Again after a little the men who were standing by said to Peter , " Truly you are one of them , for you are a Galilaean . "
41014071	But he began to curse and swear , " I do not know this man you are speaking of . "
41014072	Immediately , for the second time , the cock crew and Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him , " Before the cock crows twice you will disown me three times , " and when he thought of it he wept aloud .
41015001	PROMPTLY at dawn the high priests , after holding a consultation with the elders and the scribes and the whole council , bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate .
41015002	Pilate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " He answered him , " I am . "
41015003	The high priests went on making many charges against him .
41015004	Pilate again asked him , " Have you no answer ? See how many charges they are making against you . "
41015005	But Jesus no longer answered anything , so that Pilate wondered .
41015006	It was customary that at every feast he should release some one prisoner at their request .
41015007	There was a man called Barabbas in chains among those insurrectionaries who in the insurrection had committed murder .
41015008	The crowd advanced and began asking him to do as he was accustomed to do for them .
41015009	Pilate answered them , " Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews ? "
41015010	For he knew that it was on account of envy that the high priests had handed him over .
41015011	But the high priests incited the crowd to have him rather set free Barabbas for them .
41015012	Pilate again asked , " What , then , shall I do with him whom you call the King of the Jews ? "
41015013	They again shouted , " Crucify him ! "
41015014	But Pilate said to them , " What has he done that was wrong ? " But they shouted violently , " Crucify him ! "
41015015	Then Pilate , wishing to satisfy the crowd , set free Barabbas for them and after scourging Jesus handed him over to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers led him away inside the courtyard of the castle and called together the whole battalion .
41015017	Then they dressed him in purple and put on him a crown of thorns which they had twisted together ,
41015018	and they began to salute him , " Hail , King of the Jews ! "
41015019	They kept striking him on the head with a reed and spitting on him , and bending their knees they did homage to him .
41015020	After making sport of him , they took off the purple and put his own clothes on him . Then they led him out to crucify him .
41015021	They impressed a man who was passing by , Simon , a Cyrenian , who was coming in from the country , to carry his cross .
41015022	So they brought him to the place Golgotha , which means Skull Place .
41015023	They gave him wine flavored with myrrh , but he did not take it .
41015024	Then they crucified him . They divided his clothes , casting lots what part each should take .
41015025	It was nine in the morning when they crucified him .
41015026	The statement of his crime was written up over him : THE KING OF THE JEWS
41015027	With him were crucified also two robbers , one on his right and one on his left .
41015029	The people who passed by scoffed at him , shaking their heads and saying , " Ha , you who can pull down the Temple and build it up in three days ,
41015030	save yourself by coining down from the cross . "
41015031	In the same way the high priests , jesting with one another , and the scribes said , " He saved others ; himself he cannot save .
41015032	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , come down now from the cross so that we may see and believe . " Even the men who were crucified along with him reviled him .
41015033	At noon darkness fell on all the land and continued until three o'clock .
41015034	At three Jesus cried with a loud voice , " Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? " — which means , " My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? "
41015035	Some of the bystanders , when they heard this , said , " See , he is calling Elijah . "
41015036	One ran and filled a sponge with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink , saying , " Let him be . Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down . "
41015037	But Jesus uttered a loud cry and ceased to breathe .
41015038	Then the curtain in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	When the Centurion who was standing facing him saw that he expired in this way , he exclaimed , " Truly this man was a son of God ! "
41015040	There were also some women looking on from a distance . Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the Little and Joses , and Salome ,
41015041	who when he was in Galilee used to follow him and wait on him , and there were many others who had come up with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	It was now late in the afternoon and , since it was Preparation Day , that is the day before the Sabbath ,
41015043	Joseph of Arimathaea , a councilor of high standing , who himself was looking for the kingdom of God , took courage to go in to Pilate and ask for the body of Jesus .
41015044	Pilate wondered whether he was already dead , but he called in the Centurion and asked him whether Jesus had been long dead .
41015045	Upon learning this from the Centurion , he granted the body to Joseph .
41015046	Joseph bought a linen sheet and took him down and swathed him in it and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock . He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where Jesus was laid .
41016001	WHEN the Sabbath had passed , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought perfumes to go and anoint him .
41016002	Very early in the morning of the first day of the week they came to the tomb . The sun had risen .
41016003	They were saying to one another , " Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us ? "
41016004	But when they looked they saw that the stone had been rolled away . It was very large .
41016005	Entering the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side dressed in a white robe , and they were frightened .
41016006	But he said to them , " Do not be frightened . You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified . He has risen . He is not here . This is the place where they laid him .
41016007	But go tell his disciples and Peter , He has gone before you into Galilee . There you will see him , as he told you . "
41016008	The women came out and fled from the tomb , for trembling and amazement seized them . They told nothing to any one , they were so frightened .
41016009	After Jesus rose early on the morning of the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
41016010	She went and told those who had been with him as they were grieving and lamenting .
41016011	But they , when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her , did not believe her .
41016012	After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country .
41016013	They went and told the rest . But neither did they believe these men .
41016014	Later he appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at table , and reproached them for their lack of faith and dullness of mind because they had not believed those who had seen him since his resurrection .
41016015	He said to them , " Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all the creation .
41016016	He who believes and is baptized will be saved , but he who does not believe will be condemned .
41016017	These signs will follow those who believe : in my name they will cast out demons ; they will speak strange languages ;
41016018	they will take up serpents ; and if they drink anything deadly it will not harm them . They will lay hands on sick people and the sick will be well . "
41016019	Then the Lord Jesus , after talking with them , was taken up into heaven and sat down on the right hand of God .
41016020	They went forth and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them and confirming their message by the signs which accompanied it .
42001001	INASMUCH as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative of those facts which are firmly believed among us ,
42001002	just as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and who became bearers of the message handed them down to us ;
42001003	it has seemed good to me also — since I have followed everything from the beginning accurately — to write a consecutive account for you , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	so that you may know the exact truth in regard to the matters which you have been taught by word of mouth .
42001005	There was in the days of Herod , King of Judaea , a certain priest by the name of Zacharias , of the course of Abijah . His wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
42001006	They were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord blameless .
42001007	But they had no child , for Elizabeth was barren , and they were both advanced in years .
42001008	It happened that as Zacharias was performing his priestly duties before God in the order of his course ,
42001009	according to the custom of the priesthood , it fell to him to enter the Temple of the Lord and offer the incense .
42001010	All the congregation of people was in prayer outside , at the hour of incense .
42001011	There appeared to him an angel of the Lord , standing at the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	Zacharias , on seeing him , was alarmed and fear fell upon him .
42001013	But the angel said to him , " Do not fear , Zacharias , for your prayer has been heard ; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son , and you will call his name John .
42001014	You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth .
42001015	For he will be great before the Lord . He will not drink wine or strong drink . He will be full of the Holy Spirit even from his birth ,
42001016	and many of the sons of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God .
42001017	He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous , to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him . "
42001018	Zacharias said to the angel , " By what proof shall I know this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is advanced in years . "
42001019	The angel answered , " I am Gabriel , who stands before the face of God , and I have been sent to speak to you and to give you this good news .
42001020	And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that this comes to pass , because you have not believed my words , which will be fulfilled in their time . "
42001021	The people were waiting for Zacharias and wondering at his staying so long in the Temple .
42001022	But when he came out , he could not speak to them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the Temple . He kept making signs to them and remained dumb .
42001023	When the days of his priestly service were finished , he went away to his home .
42001024	After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months , saying ,
42001025	" So has the Lord done for me in the days in which he has looked upon me to take away my reproach among men . "
42001026	In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth ,
42001027	to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph , a descendant of David . The name of the virgin was Mary .
42001028	The angel entered and said to her , " Hail , favored one , the Lord is with you ! "
42001029	But she was alarmed at his words , and wondered what such a greeting could mean .
42001030	The angel said to her , " Do not fear , Mary ; for you have found favor with God .
42001031	You will conceive in your womb and will bear a son , and you must call his name Jesus .
42001032	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest , and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David .
42001033	He will be king over the house of Jacob through the ages , and of his kingdom there will be no end . "
42001034	But Mary said to the angel , " How can this be , since I am not united to a man ? "
42001035	The angel replied , " The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Highest will overshadow you . For that reason the child that is begotten will be called holy , Son of God .
42001036	And , indeed , Elizabeth your relative , even she , has conceived a son , in her old age , and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren .
42001037	For " no word that comes from God will fail . "
42001038	Mary said , " Here I am , the Lord's handmaid . Let it be to me according to your word . " Then the angel left her .
42001039	In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill-country to a city of Judah ,
42001040	and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting , the babe leapt in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit
42001042	and spoke out with a loud voice and said , " Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
42001043	But why do I have the honor of having the mother of my Lord come to me ?
42001044	For , indeed , when the sound of your greeting fell upon my ears , the babe leapt for joy in my womb .
42001045	Blessed is she who believed , for there will be a complete fulfillment of the things spoken to her from the Lord ! "
42001046	Then Mary said : " My soul magnifies the Lord ,
42001047	And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior ;
42001048	Because he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaid . Indeed , from this time all generations will call me blessed .
42001049	Because the Mighty One has done great things for me . Holy is his name .
42001050	His kindness is from generation to generation upon those who fear him .
42001051	He shows strength with his arm ; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts .
42001052	He casts down princes from their thrones and raises up the lowly .
42001053	The hungry he fills with good things and the affluent he sends away empty .
42001054	He brings help to Israel his servant , mindful of kindness ,
42001055	just as he promised our fathers , Abraham and his descendants , forever . "
42001056	Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home .
42001057	When Elizabeth's due time came , she gave birth to a son .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great kindness to her , and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias .
42001060	But his mother said , " No , but he shall be called John . "
42001061	They said to her , " There is no one of your family who is called by that name . "
42001062	Then they made signs to his father to know what he wanted him called .
42001063	He asked for a tablet and wrote , " His name is John . " They all wondered .
42001064	At once Zacharias's mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he spoke , praising God .
42001065	Awe fell on all their neighbors , and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these matters were talked about .
42001066	All who heard them laid them up in their minds , saying , " What then will this child be ? " For the hand of the Lord was with him .
42001067	Zacharias , his father , was filled with the Holy Spirit and said prophetically :
42001068	" Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel ! For he has looked upon his people , and made deliverance for them .
42001069	He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant ,
42001070	As he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old ,
42001071	Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all those that hate us ,
42001072	Dealing kindly with our forefathers , mindful of his holy covenant ,
42001073	The oath which he swore to Abraham our father ,
42001074	To grant that we , saved from the hands of our enemies , may serve him Without fear
42001075	in holiness and righteousness before him all our days .
42001076	And you , child , will be called a prophet of the Most High . You will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ,
42001077	To give the knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins ,
42001078	Through the tender compassion of our God , With which the sunrise from on high will shine upon us ;
42001079	To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death , To guide our feet into the path of peace . "
42001080	The child grew and became strong in spirit , and he lived in the wilds until the day of his appearance before Israel .
42002001	IN those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for the registration of the whole world .
42002002	This first registration took place while Cyrenius was Governor of Syria .
42002003	Everybody went to be registered — each to his own city .
42002004	Joseph went up from Galilee , from the city of Nazareth , to Judaea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and lineage of David ,
42002005	to be registered with Mary who was betrothed to him , and was with child .
42002006	While they were there , her time came
42002007	and she gave birth to her son , her first-born , and she wrapped him up and laid him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn .
42002008	There were shepherds in the same country staying in the fields and keeping watch over their flocks by night .
42002009	Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them . They were much afraid ,
42002010	but the angel said to them , " Have no fear ! Indeed , I am bringing you good news of a great joy which is to be for all the people ;
42002011	for there was born for you to-day in the city of David a Savior , who is Christ and Lord .
42002012	This will be a sign for you : you will find the babe wrapped up and lying in a manger . "
42002013	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude from the army of heaven , praising God , and saying ,
42002014	" Glory in highest heaven to God , and peace on earth among men in whom he delights . "
42002015	When the angels went away into heaven , the shepherds spoke to one another : " Let us go to Bethlehem and see this that has happened , which the Lord has made known to us . "
42002016	So they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger .
42002017	When they saw it , they told what had been spoken to them about this child .
42002018	All who heard it wondered at what was said to them by the shepherds .
42002019	Mary kept all these things , pondering them in her heart .
42002020	Then the shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen , just as it had been told them .
42002021	When eight days had passed and the time to circumcise him had come , his name was called Jesus — the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
42002022	When the days of their purification were completed , according to the law of Moses , they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord ,
42002023	as it is written in the Law of the Lord , " Every firstborn male shall be called holy to the Lord , "
42002024	and to give an offering according to what is said in the law of the Lord , " a pair of doves or two young pigeons . "
42002025	There was in Jerusalem a man named Simeon , and this man was upright and God-fearing , looking forward to the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
42002026	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he was not to see death before he saw the Lord's Christ .
42002027	Led by the Spirit he came into the Temple courts , and when the parents brought in the child Jesus in order to do for him according to the custom of the law ,
42002028	he took him into his arms and blessed God , and said ,
42002029	" Now , O Lord , thou art letting thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word .
42002030	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
42002031	which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples ,
42002032	a light for revelation to Gentiles and a glory to thy people Israel . "
42002033	His father and his mother wondered at the things that were spoken about him .
42002034	Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary his mother , " This child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel and for a sign much spoken against
42002035	in order that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed . "
42002036	And there was Anna , a prophetess , a daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was far advanced in years , having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood
42002037	and having been a widow for now eighty-four years . She never left the Temple courts , but worshiped by fastings and prayers , night and day .
42002038	She too came up at that time and praised God and spoke about him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem .
42002039	When they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth .
42002040	The child grew and became strong and was filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him .
42002041	His parents used to go up every year to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover .
42002042	When he had reached the age of twelve years , and they had gone up according to the custom of the feast
42002043	and had completed the days and were returning , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . But his parents did not know it .
42002044	Thinking that he was in the company , they went a day's journey . But when they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances
42002045	and did not find him , they returned to Jerusalem searching for him .
42002046	On the third day they found him in the Temple courts , sitting in the midst of the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	All who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers .
42002048	When his parents saw him , they were amazed , and his mother said to him , " Child , why have you treated us so ? See , your father and I have been searching for you in great distress . "
42002049	He said to them , " Why were you searching for me ? Did you not know that I must be at my Father's ? "
42002050	They did not understand the words that he spoke .
42002051	Then he went down with them , and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them . His mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
42002052	And Jesus grew in wisdom and in height and in favor with God and with men .
42003001	IN the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judaea and Herod Prince of Galilee , and Philip his brother Prince of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias Prince of Abilene ,
42003002	during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wild lands .
42003003	Then he came into all the neighborhood of the Jordan proclaiming baptism for a change of heart in order to forgiveness of sins ,
42003004	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , " The voice of one shouting in the wilderness , ' Prepare the way of the Lord , make his paths straight ! '
42003005	Every ravine shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be graded down , and the crooked places shall become straight and the rough roads shall become smooth ,
42003006	and all men shall see the salvation of God . "
42003007	He said to the crowds that went out to be baptized by him , " Brood of vipers , who warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
42003008	Produce then fruits suitable for a change of heart , and do not begin to say to yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father . ' For I tell you , God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham .
42003009	Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees . Every tree that does not yield good fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire . "
42003010	The crowds asked him , " What then shall we do ? "
42003011	He answered , " Let him who has two tunics give to him who has none , and let him who has food do likewise . "
42003012	Some tax collectors came to be baptized and said to him , " Teacher , what shall we do ? "
42003013	He said to them , " Do nothing beyond what you are authorized . "
42003014	Soldiers asked him , " And what shall we do ? " He said to them , " Do violence to no man ; bring no false accusations ; be content with your rations . "
42003015	As the people were in expectation and all were debating in their minds about John , whether he was the Christ ,
42003016	John said to them all , " I am baptizing you with water , but there is coming the One mightier than I , the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to unfasten . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
42003017	He has his fan in his hand to cleanse his threshing floor and gather the wheat into his granary . But the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable . "
42003018	With many different exhortations John proclaimed the good news to the people .
42003019	But Herod , the prince , because John reproved him regarding Herodias , his brother's wife , and regarding all the wicked things which Herod had done ,
42003020	added also this wickedness to all the rest — he shut up John in prison .
42003021	When all the people were being baptized , and when Jesus had been baptized and was praying , heaven was opened ,
42003022	and the Holy Spirit in bodily form like a dove descended upon him , and a voice came from heaven , " Thou art my Son , the Beloved . In thee I delight . "
42003023	Jesus , when he began , was about thirty years old , being the son of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	the son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	the son of Jesus , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	the son of Symeon , the son of Judas , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	the son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	the son of Amminadab , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	the son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	the son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan ,
42003038	the son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	JESUS , full of the Holy Spirit , turned back from the Jordan and was led about in the Spirit in the wilderness
42004002	forty days while being tempted by the Devil . During those days he ate nothing , and when they were ended he was hungry .
42004003	The Devil said to him , " If you are God's Son , tell this stone to become a loaf of bread . "
42004004	Jesus answered him , " It is written , ' Man shall not live on bread alone . ' "
42004005	The Devil led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time ,
42004006	and said to him , " To you I will give all this power and glory , for it has been handed over to me and I give it to whomever I will .
42004007	If you do homage before me , all shall be yours . "
42004008	Jesus answered him , " It is written , ' Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God and him alone shalt thou worship . ' "
42004009	The Devil took him to Jerusalem and placed him on the roof of the Temple , and said to him , " If you are God's Son , throw yourself down ,
42004010	for it is written , ' He will command his angels to guard you , '
42004011	and , ' On their hands they will bear you up , so that you shall not strike your foot against a stone . ' "
42004012	Jesus answered him , " It has been said , ' Thou shalt not try the Lord thy God . ' "
42004013	After exhausting every kind of temptation , the Devil went away from him till a better opportunity .
42004014	Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and reports about him went out through all the region .
42004015	He taught in their synagogues and was praised by all .
42004016	He came to Nazareth where he had been brought up , and , according to his custom , went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
42004017	The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . He opened the book and found the place where it is written ,
42004018	" The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim release to captives and sight to the blind , to set at liberty the crushed ,
42004019	to proclaim the favored year of the Lord . "
42004020	Then he rolled up the book and handed it over to the attendant and sat down . The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him .
42004021	He began and said to them , " To-day this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears . "
42004022	All bore witness to him , and wondered at the gracious words that came from his mouth , and said , " Is not he a son of Joseph ? "
42004023	He said to them , " Of course , you will quote to me the saying , ' Physician , heal yourself . ' ' Whatever we have heard of as done in Capernaum , do here in your native place . '
42004024	He continued : " I tell you truly no prophet is acceptable in his native place .
42004025	In truth I tell you , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah the prophet , when heaven was shut up three years and six months so that a great famine came on all the land ,
42004026	yet to no widow was Elijah sent except to one in Zarephath , in Sidonia .
42004027	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and no leper was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian . "
42004028	Upon hearing these words , all in the synagogue were filled with rage ,
42004029	and they rose up and expelled him from the city , and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built , intending to throw him down .
42004030	But he passed through the midst of them and went away .
42004031	He went down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . There he was teaching them on the Sabbath ,
42004032	and they were amazed at his teaching , because he spoke with authority .
42004033	In the synagogue there was a man with the spirit of an impure demon , and he shouted with a loud voice ,
42004034	" Ha , what have you to do with us , Nazarene Jesus ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — The Holy One of God . "
42004035	Jesus rebuked him , saying , " Be silent , and come out of him . " The demon flung him prostrate in the midst , but came out of him without injuring him at all .
42004036	Astonishment fell upon all , and they talked to one another , saying , " What is this word ? With authority and power he commands the impure spirits and they come out ! "
42004037	Reports about him spread into every part of that region .
42004038	Jesus arose and left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon . Simon's wife's mother was suffering from a severe fever , and they asked him to help her .
42004039	He came and stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her . At once she rose up and waited upon them .
42004040	As the sun was setting , all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him , and he put his hands on each of them and healed them .
42004041	Demons came out of many , shouting , " You are the Son of God ! " But he rebuked them and did not permit them to speak , for they knew that he was the Christ .
42004042	When morning came , he went out and departed to a solitary place . The crowds were looking for him and came to where he was and tried to hinder his going away from them .
42004043	But he said to them , " I must tell the good news about the kingdom of God in the other cities also , because for this I have been sent . "
42004044	So he continued teaching in the synagogues of Galilee .
42005001	IT happened that , as the crowd was pressing upon him and listening to the word of God , he was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret ,
42005002	and he saw two boats by the shore . The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets .
42005003	He got into one of the boats , which belonged to Simon , and asked him to push off a little from the land . Then , sitting down , he taught the people from the boat .
42005004	When he ceased speaking , he said to Simon , " Push out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch . "
42005005	Simon answered , " Master , we have worked all night and caught nothing . But at your word I will let down the nets . "
42005006	When they had done this , they enclosed a great mass of fishes and their nets began to break .
42005007	They beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and take hold with them . They came , and both the boats were filled so that they began to sink .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw this , he fell down on his knees before Jesus and said , " Leave my boat and me , Sir , for I am a sinful man . "
42005009	For amazement seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fishes they had taken .
42005010	It was just the same with James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . But Jesus said to Simon , " Never fear ; from now on you will be catching men . "
42005011	Then they brought their boats to land and left all and followed him .
42005012	It happened that , when he was in one of the cities , there was a man present full of leprosy . When he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and begged him , " Sir , if you will , you can cleanse me . "
42005013	Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him , and said , " I will it ; be cleansed . " Immediately the leprosy left him .
42005014	Jesus commanded him to tell no one . " But go , " he said , " and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded , for evidence to them . "
42005015	But all the more the reports about him spread , and great crowds came together to hear and to be healed of their infirmities .
42005016	But he stayed out in the wild country and prayed .
42005017	It happened on one of those days that he was teaching , and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting who had come from every village of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem . The power of the Lord was with him to heal .
42005018	Then came some men bearing on a bed a man who was paralytic , and they tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus .
42005019	When they could not contrive to bring him in on account of the crowd , they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his pallet into the midst in front of Jesus .
42005020	He saw their faith and said , " Man , your sins are forgiven you . "
42005021	The scribes and Pharisees began to argue , saying , " Who is this man who speaks profane words ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? "
42005022	But Jesus perceived their arguing and asked them , " What are you arguing in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier , to say , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Rise and walk ' ?
42005024	But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on the earth to forgive sins " — he said to the paralytic — " I tell you , Rise and take up your pallet and go to your house . "
42005025	Immediately he stood up before them and took up what he had been lying on and went away to his house , glorifying God .
42005026	Amazement seized them all and they gave glory to God , yet they were also filled with awe , and said , " We have seen astonishing things today ! "
42005027	After this he went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at the tax office , and he said to him , " Follow me . "
42005028	Leaving everything , he arose and followed him .
42005029	Levi held a great reception for him at his house , and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them .
42005030	The Pharisees and their scribes grumbled to his disciples , and said , " Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? "
42005031	Jesus answered them , " The well have no need of a physician , but those who are sick have .
42005032	I have not come to call righteous men , but sinners to a change of heart . "
42005033	They said to him , " The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers , and so do those of the Pharisees , but your followers eat and drink . "
42005034	Jesus said to them , " Can you make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them ?
42005035	But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and then they will fast — in those days . "
42005036	He gave them also some illustrations . " No one tears a piece from a new cloak and sews it on an old cloak . If he did , he would make a tear in his new cloak , and even in the old cloak the patch taken from the new would not match .
42005037	And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins . If he did , the new wine would burst the skins and it would be spilled , and the skins would be ruined .
42005038	But new wine must be put into new wine-skins .
42005039	And no one after drinking old wine wishes to drink new , for he says , ' The old is fine . ' "
42006001	IT happened that he was passing one Sabbath through some grainfields , and his disciples were plucking and eating the heads of grain , rubbing them in their hands .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees said , " Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath ? "
42006003	Jesus answered them , " Have you never read what David did when he was hungry , he and the men with him —
42006004	how he went into the house of God and took the consecrated loaves and ate them and gave them to his men , loaves that it is unlawful for any but the priests alone to eat ? "
42006005	He said further to them , " The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . "
42006006	It happened on another Sabbath that he went into the synagogue and was teaching . There was a man there whose right hand was withered .
42006007	The scribes and Pharisees watched to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath , wishing to find something to accuse him of .
42006008	But he knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand , " Rise , and stand in the center . " He rose and stood .
42006009	Jesus said to them , " I ask you , is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to destroy it ? "
42006010	He looked around at all of them , then said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He did so and his hand was restored .
42006011	But they were filled with blind fury , and discussed with one another what they could do to Jesus .
42006012	It happened during those days that he went out to the mountain and prayed and was all night in prayer to God .
42006013	When day came , he called to him his disciples and chose from them twelve , whom also he named " Apostles " :
42006014	Simon , whom he named Peter , and Andrew his brother , and James and John , and Philip and Bartholomew ,
42006015	and Matthew and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called the Zealot ,
42006016	and Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
42006017	He went down with them and stood on a level spot where were gathered a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon , who had come to hear him and to be cured of their diseases .
42006018	Those who were troubled by impure spirits were healed .
42006019	The whole crowd tried to touch him , because power went out from him and healed all .
42006020	He raised his eyes to his disciples and said : " Blessed are you poor ! For yours is the kingdom of God .
42006021	" Blessed are you who are hungry now ! For you will be abundantly fed . " Blessed are you who are weeping now ! For you will laugh .
42006022	" Blessed are you when men hate you and when they shut you out and reproach you and cast out your name as evil because of the Son of Man !
42006023	Rejoice on that day and leap for joy . For , indeed , your reward will be great in heaven . Just so their fathers treated the prophets .
42006024	" But alas for you rich men ! For you have now your comfort in full .
42006025	" Alas for you who are filled now ! For you will hunger . " Alas for you who are laughing now ! For you will mourn and wail .
42006026	" Alas for you , when all men speak well of you ! Just so their fathers treated the false prophets .
42006027	But I tell you , my hearers , love your enemies ; act nobly to those who hate you ;
42006028	bless those who curse you ; pray for those who insult you .
42006029	To him who strikes you on one cheek , offer also the other . To him who takes your cloak , do not refuse your tunic .
42006030	To every one who asks , give , and from him who takes your things , do not ask them back .
42006031	Do to men just as you wish them to do to you .
42006032	If you love those who love you , what grace have you ? For sinners also love those who love them .
42006033	If you do good to those who do good to you , what grace have you ? Sinners also do the same .
42006034	If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive , what grace have you ? Sinners also lend to sinners in order to get back as much .
42006035	But love your enemies and do good and lend without hope of return , and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the Most High . For he is generous to the ungrateful and wicked .
42006036	Become compassionate as your Father is compassionate .
42006037	Do not judge and you will not be judged . Do not condemn and you will not be condemned . Forgive and you will be forgiven .
42006038	Give and it will be given to you . Good measure , pressed in , shaken down , and running over they will pour into your lap . For with the measure that you measure with will the return to you be measured . "
42006039	He gave them an illustration : " The blind cannot lead the blind , can he ? Will not both fall into the ditch ?
42006040	A scholar is not superior to his teacher . Every scholar when finished will be like his teacher .
42006041	Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye while you do not perceive the beam in your own eye ?
42006042	How can you say to your brother , ' Brother , let me get out the speck that is in your eye , ' while you yourself never notice the beam in your own eye ? Hypocrite , take out first the beam from your own eye , and then you will see clearly to get out the speck in your brother's eye .
42006043	" There is no good tree that yields worthless fruit , nor is there a worthless tree that yields fine fruit .
42006044	Every tree will be known by its own fruit . They do not gather figs from thorns , nor from a bramble-bush do they harvest grapes .
42006045	A good man from the good treasury of his heart brings forth what is good , and the evil man from his evil treasury brings forth what is evil . Out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks .
42006046	" Why do you call me : ' Master , Master , ' and yet not do what I say ?
42006047	Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them , I will show you whom he is like .
42006048	He is like a man building a house , who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock . When a flood came , the river dashed against that house , and could not shake it , because it had been well built .
42006049	But he who hears and does not do is like a man building a house on the earth without foundation , against which the river dashed , and at once it fell , and the wreck of that house was great . "
42007001	WHEN he had finished all his discourses in the hearing of the people , he went into Capernaum .
42007002	The servant of a certain Centurion was sick and about to die . He was highly valued by his master ,
42007003	who hearing about Jesus sent to him some elders of the Jews , asking him to come and save his servant .
42007004	When they came to Jesus they begged him earnestly , saying , " He deserves to have this done ,
42007005	for he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue . "
42007006	Jesus went with them . When he was not far from the house , the Centurion sent friends to say to him , " Do not trouble yourself , Sir , for I am not fit to have you come under my roof .
42007007	On that account I did not think myself worthy to come to you . But say the word and have my servant cured .
42007008	For I am a man — under authority — with soldiers under me , and I say to this one , ' Go , ' and he goes , and to that one , ' Come , ' and he comes , and to my slave , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
42007009	When Jesus heard this , he wondered , and , turning to the crowd that was following him , he said , " I tell you , in Israel I have not found such faith . "
42007010	Those who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well .
42007011	It happened soon afterwards that he went to a city called Nain , and his disciples and a great crowd were going along with him .
42007012	As he approached the gate of the city , they were carrying out a dead man , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . A great crowd from the city was with her .
42007013	When the Master saw her , he had compassion on her and said to her , " Do not weep , "
42007014	and he went up and touched the bier . The bearers stopped . He said , " Young man , I say , arise ! "
42007015	The dead man sat up and began to speak , and he gave him to his mother .
42007016	All were awe-struck , and they gave praise to God , saying , " A great prophet has arisen among us and God has visited his people . "
42007017	The reports about him spread through all Judaea and all the region of the Jordan .
42007018	John's disciples told him about all these things .
42007019	So he called to him two of his disciples and sent them to the Master to ask , " Are you ' the Coming One ' or are we to expect some other person ? "
42007020	When they came to him , the men said , " John the Baptist sent us to you to ask , Are you ' the Coming One ' or are we to expect some other person ? "
42007021	At that very time he was curing many of diseases and pains and wicked spirits , and to many blind people he was giving sight .
42007022	He answered them , " Go and relate to John what you have seen and heard . Blind men see , lame men walk , lepers are cleansed , deaf men hear , dead men are raised , poor men hear good news .
42007023	Blessed is he who does not stumble through misunderstanding me ! "
42007024	After John's messengers had left , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : " What did you go out into the wild country to look at ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothes ? Indeed , the people in splendid clothing and living in luxury are in kings ' palaces .
42007026	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	For this is he about whom it was written , ' Behold , I send my messenger before your face , who will make ready your way before you . '
42007028	I tell you there is not among those born of women a greater than John . But an inferior in the kingdom of God is greater than he . "
42007029	( All the people , even the tax collectors when they heard him , had confessed that God was right by being baptized with the baptism of John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the lawyers had thwarted the purpose of God in reference to themselves by not being baptized by him . )
42007031	" To what then shall I compare the men of this generation ? What are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another , ' We played the flute for you but you did not dance . We mourned but you did not wail ! '
42007033	For John the Baptist has come , not eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , ' He has a demon . '
42007034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ' See there a man who is a glutton and wine-drinker , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! '
42007035	Yet Wisdom is shown to be in the right by all her children . "
42007036	One of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him . Entering the house of this Pharisee , he reclined at the table .
42007037	Now there was a certain woman in the city , a sinner , and when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house , she brought an alabaster jar of ointment
42007038	and took her place behind , beside his feet , weeping . Her tears began to rain down on his feet , and with the hair of her head she wiped them off , and she passionately kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment .
42007039	When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this , he said within himself , " This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what this woman who is touching him is , for she is a sinner . "
42007040	Jesus , answering his thought , said to him , " Simon , I have something to say to you . " " Teacher , " he said , " say it . "
42007041	" A certain money-lender had two debtors ; one owed him five hundred shillings ; the other fifty .
42007042	Because they had nothing to pay with , he graciously forgave both . Which of them will love him most ? "
42007043	Simon answered , " I suppose the one to whom he forgave most . " He said to him , " You have answered correctly . "
42007044	Then , turning to the woman , he said to Simon , " Do you see this woman ? I entered your house ; you gave me no water for my feet . But she has rained tears upon my feet and has wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You gave me no kiss , but she , since I came in , has not ceased passionately kissing my feet .
42007046	My head with oil you did not anoint , but she has anointed my feet with ointment .
42007047	For this reason I tell you her sins , many as they are , have been forgiven , for she loved much . For he to whom little is forgiven loves little . "
42007048	He said to her , " Your sins have been forgiven . "
42007049	The other guests began to say to themselves , " Who is this that even forgives sins ? "
42007050	He said to the woman , " Your faith has saved you . Go in peace . "
42008001	SHORTLY afterwards he was making his way through cities and villages preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God . The twelve were with him ,
42008002	and certain women who had been relieved of evil spirits and infirmities — Mary , who was called Magdalene , out of whom seven demons had gone ,
42008003	and Joanna , the wife of Chuzas , Herod's manager , and Susanna , and many others . These women provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their means .
42008004	When a great multitude was coming together and some from every city were crowding upon him , he spoke to them with an illustration :
42008005	" A sower went out to sow his seed . As he sowed , some seed fell along the roadside and was trodden on , and the birds of heaven ate it up .
42008006	Other seed fell on the rock , and when it sprang up it withered away because it had no moisture .
42008007	Other seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it .
42008008	Other seed fell into the good ground , and grew up and yielded a harvest a hundred fold . " When he said this , he called out , " Let him who has ears to hear , hear . "
42008009	His disciples kept asking him what the illustration meant .
42008010	He said : " To you it is granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God . But to the rest the message comes in figures of speech , so that although they see they may not see , and although they hear they may not understand .
42008011	This is the illustration : The seed is the message of God .
42008012	Those by the roadside are those who hear , and then the Devil comes and takes away the message from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved .
42008013	Those on the rock are those who , though they receive the message with joy , yet have no root , who for a while believe , but in the time of trial desert .
42008014	That which fell among thorns means those who hear , and as they go on are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring nothing to completion .
42008015	That in the good ground means those who with a noble and good heart hear the message and hold it fast and bear fruit in patience .
42008016	" No one lights a lamp and hides it with a bowl or puts it under a bed . No , he puts it on a stand so that all who come in may see the light .
42008017	For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest , nor secret which will not be known and come to light .
42008018	Be careful , then , how you hear ; for whoever has , to him will be given , and whoever has not , even what he seems to have will be taken away from him . "
42008019	His mother and his brothers came where he was , but could not get to him on account of the crowd .
42008020	It was told him , " Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wishing to see you . "
42008021	He answered , " My mother and my brothers are these who are hearing the word of God and doing it . "
42008022	It happened one day that he got into a boat , and his disciples went with him . He said to them , " Let us cross over to the other side of the lake . " They put out .
42008023	While they were sailing he fell asleep . A gale of wind came down on the lake and the boat was filling and in peril .
42008024	Coming to him , they awoke him , saying , " Master , Master , we are going down ! " He awoke and rebuked the wind and the waves . They grew quiet and there was a calm .
42008025	He said to the disciples , " Where is your faith ? " They were awed and amazed , and said to one another , " Who then is this man who commands the winds and the water and they obey him ? "
42008026	They sailed to the land of the Gerasenes , which is across from Galilee .
42008027	When he got out on to the land , there met him a certain man from that city who had demons . For a long time he had not worn clothes and had not lived in a house , but in the tombs .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he screamed and fell down before him , and in a loud voice said , " What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of God Most High ? I pray you , do not torment me . "
42008029	For he had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man . Many times it had seized him , and , though he was bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard , yet bursting his chains he would be driven by the demon off into the wilds .
42008030	Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " He said , " Legion , " for many demons had entered into him .
42008031	They begged him not to bid them go away into the abyss .
42008032	There was near by a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain . The demons begged him to permit them to go into the swine . He gave them leave .
42008033	The demons left the man and entered the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned .
42008034	The herdsmen , seeing what had happened , fled and told it in the city and on the farms .
42008035	The people came out to see what had happened . When they came to Jesus , they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right mind , and they were struck with awe .
42008036	Those who had seen it told them how the demoniac had been cured .
42008037	Whereupon all the crowd from the region of the Gerasenes asked him to go away from them , for they were seized with great fear . So he got into a boat and returned .
42008038	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to let him be with him . But he sent him away , saying ,
42008039	" Return to your home and tell how much God has done for you . " He went through the whole city proclaiming how much Jesus had done for him .
42008040	As Jesus came back , a crowd welcomed him , for all were expecting him .
42008041	There came a man by the name of Jairus — he was a synagogue director . Falling at the feet of Jesus , he begged him to come to his house
42008042	because he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . As he was going the crowds pressed around him .
42008043	A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years , and could not be cured by any one ,
42008044	came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak . At once her hemorrhage ceased .
42008045	Jesus said , " Who is it that touched me ? " All denied , and Peter said , " Master , the crowd is pressing upon you on every side . "
42008046	Jesus said , " Some one touched me , for I know that power has gone forth from me . "
42008047	The woman , seeing that she had not escaped notice , came trembling and fell before him , and told before all the people why she had touched him and how she was instantly cured .
42008048	He said to her , " Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace . "
42008049	While he was still speaking some one came from the Director's house , saying , " Your daughter is dead . Do not trouble the teacher any longer . "
42008050	Jesus heard it and said to him , " Never fear . Only believe and she will be saved . "
42008051	When he came to the house , he did not permit any one to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father of the child and her mother .
42008052	All were weeping and wailing for her . He said , " Do not weep . She is not dead , but asleep . "
42008053	They laughed at him , knowing that she was dead .
42008054	But he took hold of her hand and said to her , " Little girl , rise up . "
42008055	Her spirit returned and at once she stood up . He told them to give her something to eat .
42008056	Her parents were amazed , but he told them not to tell any one of what had happened .
42009001	JESUS called together the twelve and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases .
42009002	Then he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal .
42009003	He said to them , " Take nothing for your journey , no stick , no bag , no bread , no money , nor have so much as two tunics .
42009004	Whatever house you enter , stay there and leave from there .
42009005	Whoever do not receive you — as you go out from that city , shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them . "
42009006	Going forth , they began telling the good news from village to village and performing cures everywhere .
42009007	Herod the Prince heard of all that was going on , and he was at a loss because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead ,
42009008	by some that Elijah had appeared , and by others that some one of the old prophets had arisen .
42009009	Herod said , " John I beheaded . Who is this about whom I hear such things ? " And he made efforts to see him .
42009010	The apostles returned and told Jesus all that they had done . Taking them with him , he went away privately to a city called Bethsaida .
42009011	The crowds found it out and followed him . He welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God , and cured those who needed healing .
42009012	When the day began to decline , the twelve came and said to him , " Dismiss the crowd , so that they may go to the villages and farms around and put up for the night and find food , for here we are in the wild lands . "
42009013	He said to them , " Give them something to eat yourselves . " They replied , " We have not more than five loaves and two fishes . We cannot go and buy food for all this crowd , can we ? "
42009014	There were about five thousand men . He said to his disciples , " Have them recline in rows of fifty . "
42009015	They did so , and made all recline .
42009016	Taking the five loaves and the fishes , he looked up to heaven and blessed them and broke them and gave to the disciples to distribute to the crowd .
42009017	They all ate and had abundance , and what was left over was picked up — twelve baskets of fragments .
42009018	Once when he was praying alone , his disciples joined him , and he asked them , " Who do the crowds say that I am ? "
42009019	They answered , " John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; others that some one of the old prophets has arisen . "
42009020	He said to them , " But you , who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
42009021	But he rebuked him , and charged them not to say this to any one ,
42009022	telling them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and high priests and be killed , and on the third day be raised .
42009023	He said to all : " If any one chooses to come after me , let him disown himself and take up his cross every day and follow me .
42009024	He who chooses to save his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life for my sake will save it .
42009025	For what will it profit a man to gain the whole world if he has lost or forfeited himself ?
42009026	Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words , of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and that of his Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God . "
42009028	About eight days after this conversation , Jesus took with him Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to pray .
42009029	While he was praying , the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became radiant white .
42009030	Suddenly two men were talking with him . They were Moses and Elijah ,
42009031	who appeared in glory and spoke of his passing which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem .
42009032	Peter and his companions had been weighed down with sleep , but becoming fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him .
42009033	As they were departing from him , Peter said to Jesus , " Master , it is fine for us to be here . Let us make three tents , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah , " not knowing what he was saying .
42009034	While he was saying it there came a cloud and over-shadowed them . They were frightened as they entered the cloud .
42009035	Then a voice came from the cloud saying , " This is my Son , the Chosen , listen to him . "
42009036	When the voice came , Jesus was there alone . They kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen .
42009037	On the next day , as they were coming down from the mountain , a great crowd met him ,
42009038	and suddenly a man from the crowd cried out , " Teacher , I pray you look at my son , for he is my only one ,
42009039	and see , a spirit seizes him and all at once he shrieks . It convulses him till he foams and it hardly leaves off tormenting him .
42009040	I begged your disciples to cast it out , but they could not . "
42009041	Jesus answered , " O faithless and perverted generation , how long must I be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son here . "
42009042	Even while he was coming , the demon dashed him down and convulsed him . Jesus rebuked the impure spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
42009043	They were amazed at the greatness of God . While they were all wondering at all the things that he did , he said to his disciples ,
42009044	" Receive these words into your ears . The Son of Man will soon be betrayed into the hands of men . "
42009045	But they did not understand this remark , and it was hidden from them so that they did not take it in , and they were afraid to ask him about it .
42009046	A dispute started among them as to which of them was greatest .
42009047	Jesus knew the question that was in their minds , and he took a little child and stood him beside himself .
42009048	Then he said to them , " Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me . And whoever welcomes me welcomes him who sent me . For he who is least among you all , he is great . "
42009049	John answered , " Master , we saw one casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he is not following along with us . "
42009050	But Jesus said to him , " Do not stop him , for he who is not against you is for you . "
42009051	As the days before his being taken up to heaven were passing , he set his face to go to Jerusalem
42009052	and sent on messengers in advance . In journeying they came to a village of Samaritans to make arrangements for him .
42009053	The Samaritans did not receive him because his face was toward Jerusalem .
42009054	On seeing this , his disciples James and John said , " Sir , do you want us to bid fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? "
42009055	But he turned and rebuked them . So they journeyed to another village .
42009057	As they were traveling on the road , a man said to him , " I will follow you wherever you go . "
42009058	Jesus said to him , " The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have coverts , but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head . "
42009059	He said to another , " Follow me . " But he said , " Let me first go and bury my father . "
42009060	Jesus said to him , " Let the dead bury their own dead , but you go and announce far and wide the kingdom of God . "
42009061	Another said , " I will follow you , Sir , but first let me say good-bye to those at my home . "
42009062	Jesus said to him , " No one who has put his hand to the plow and is looking backward is fit for the kingdom of God . "
42010001	AFTER this , the Master appointed seventy others and sent them out two and two before him into every city and place where he was soon to come .
42010002	He said to them , " The harvest is great , but the laborers are few . Pray , therefore , to the Owner of the harvest to hurry out laborers into his harvest .
42010003	Go ; I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves .
42010004	Carry no purse , no bag , no shoes , and salute no one by the way .
42010005	Whatever house you enter , first say , ' Peace be to this house . '
42010006	And if a son of peace is there , your peace will rest upon it ; but if not , it will return upon you .
42010007	In the same house remain , eating and drinking what they have , for the laborer is worthy of his wages . Do not change about from house to house .
42010008	Whatever city you enter , if they welcome you , eat what is set before you .
42010009	Heal those in it that are sick and tell them , ' The kingdom of God is near you . '
42010010	Whatever city you enter and they do not welcome you , go out into the streets of it and say ,
42010011	' Even the dust of your city that clings to our feet we wipe off for you ; but know this , that the kingdom of God is near . '
42010012	I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city .
42010013	Alas for you , Chorazin ! Alas for you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles that have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would long ago have repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you .
42010015	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? You will be abased to Hades !
42010016	" He who hears you hears me , and he who rejects you rejects me . He who rejects me rejects him who sent me . "
42010017	The seventy returned with joy saying , " Master , even the demons are subject to us in your name . "
42010018	He said to them , " I was looking when Satan fell like lightning from heaven .
42010019	See , I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing will hurt you .
42010020	However , in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . "
42010021	At that hour in exultant joy through the Holy Sprit he said , " I thank thee , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and hast revealed them to babes . Yea , Father , I thank thee that such became thy good pleasure .
42010022	" All things have been committed to me by my Father , and no one knows who the Son is but the Father , or who the Father is but the Son , and he to whom the Son may will to reveal him . "
42010023	Turning to his disciples , he said privately , " Blessed are your eyes that see what you see !
42010024	I tell you , many prophets and kings wished to see the things that you see and did not see them , and to hear the things that you hear and did not hear them . "
42010025	Then a certain lawyer stood up to test him , and said , " Teacher , what must I do to inherit life eternal ? "
42010026	He said to him , " What is written in the Law ? How do you read it ? "
42010027	He answered , " ' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind , and thy neighbor as thyself . '
42010028	Jesus said to him , " You have answered correctly ; do this and you will live . "
42010029	But he , wishing to justify himself , said to Jesus , " And who is my neighbor ? "
42010030	Jesus rejoined , " A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers , who stripped him and beat him and went away leaving him half dead .
42010031	By chance a certain priest was going down that road . When he saw him , he went by on the other side .
42010032	In the same way a Levite came to the place and saw him , and passed by on the other side .
42010033	But a certain Samaritan as he traveled came near him , and saw him and pitied him ,
42010034	and went to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring on them oil and wine . Then placing him on his own beast he took him to the inn and cared for him .
42010035	The next morning he took out two shillings and gave them to the inn-keeper and said , ' Care for him , and what evermore you spend , I will pay in full when I come back . '
42010036	Which of these three seems to you to have become neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers ? "
42010037	He said , " He who did kindness to him . " Jesus said to him , " Go and act in the same way yourself . "
42010038	As they journeyed , he entered a certain village . There a woman named Martha welcomed him to her house .
42010039	She had a sister called Mary who seated herself at the feet of the Master and was listening to his words .
42010040	But Martha was busy and worried over a great deal of service . Coming to him she said , " Master , do you not care that my sister has left me to do the work alone ? Tell her to take hold with me . "
42010041	But the Master answered her , " Martha , Martha , you are anxious and worried about many things ,
42010042	but there is need only of a few , or one . Mary has chosen the good part and it shall not be taken from her . "
42011001	ONCE he was in a certain place praying . When he ceased , one of his disciples said to him , " Master , teach us to pray , as John taught his disciples . "
42011002	He said to them , " When you pray say : Father , thy name be kept holy ; Thy kingdom come ;
42011003	Our bread for the coming day Give us day by day ;
42011004	And forgive us our sins ; For we ourselves forgive every one who fails toward us . And bring us not into trial . "
42011005	He said to them , " Suppose one of you has a friend and goes to him at midnight and says to him , ' Friend , lend me three loaves ,
42011006	for a friend of mine has come to my house after a journey and I have nothing to set before him ' ;
42011007	and he from within answers , ' Do not trouble me ; the door is locked , and my children and I are in bed ; I cannot get up and give you anything . '
42011008	I tell you , even if he will not rise and give them to him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him all that he needs .
42011009	So I tell you , ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be opened to you .
42011010	For every one who asks obtains , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks the door will be opened .
42011011	What father is there among you who if his son asks for bread will give him a stone ? Or if he asks for a fish , will he give him a serpent instead ?
42011012	Or if he asks for an egg , will he give him a scorpion ?
42011013	If then you , evil though you are , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Heavenly Father give a holy spirit to those who ask him . "
42011014	He was casting out a demon and it was dumb . After the demon had gone out , the dumb man spoke and the crowds wondered .
42011015	But some of them said , " By Beelzebul , the chief of the demons , he casts out the demons . "
42011016	Others , by way of test , demanded of him a sign from heaven .
42011017	But he , knowing their reasonings , said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation , and a house divided against itself falls .
42011018	If Satan is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? You say that I am casting out demons by Beelzebul ;
42011019	but if I am casting out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore let them be your judges .
42011020	But if I am casting out demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has already reached you .
42011021	" When a strong man fully armed guards his castle , his possessions are in peace .
42011022	But when a stronger than he comes upon him and conquers him , he takes all the armor in which he trusted and divides the spoils .
42011023	He who is not with me is against me , and he who does not gather with me is scattering .
42011024	" When the impure spirit comes out from a man , he goes through waterless places , seeking rest . Not finding it , he says , ' I will return to my house from which I came out . '
42011025	When he comes , he finds it empty , swept , and put in order .
42011026	Then he goes and takes along seven spirits worse than himself , and they enter and settle down there , and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . "
42011027	While he was saying this a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said , " Blessed was the womb that carried you and the breasts that you sucked ! "
42011028	He said , " Blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it ! "
42011029	As the crowds were thronging about him , he began and said , " This generation is an evil generation . It seeks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah .
42011030	For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites so the Son of Man will be to this generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will rise in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them . For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and more than a Solomon is here .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it . For they repented at the proclamation of Jonah , and indeed more than a Jonah is here .
42011033	" No one lights a lamp and places it in a cellar or under the peck-measure , but on the stand , so that those who come in may see the light .
42011034	The lamp of the body is the eye . When your eye is clear the whole body is lighted . But when it is bad , your body is dark .
42011035	Make sure that the light that is in you is not darkness .
42011036	If your body is all lighted up , not having any part dark , it will be all lighted as when the lamp lights you by its brilliance . "
42011037	During his talk a Pharisee kept asking him to dine with him . He went in and reclined at table .
42011038	The Pharisee , seeing this , wondered that he had not first washed before dinner .
42011039	The Master said to him , " Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter , but the inside of you is full of rapacity and wickedness .
42011040	You foolish men , did not he who made the outside make the inside too ?
42011041	But give the things inside as gifts of mercy and at once all will be clean for you .
42011042	But alas for you , Pharisees ! Because you tithe mint , and rue , and every herb , and pass by justice and the love of God . These things you ought to have practiced , without omitting the others .
42011043	Alas for you , Pharisees ! for you love the first seats in the synagogues and greetings in the market-places .
42011044	Alas for you ! for you are like unmarked graves . The men who walk over them do not know it . "
42011045	One of the lawyers answered him , " Teacher , in saying this you treat us roughly too . "
42011046	He said , " Alas for you lawyers also ! for you burden men with burdens hard to bear , and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
42011047	Alas for you ! for you build the tombs of the prophets , but your fathers killed them .
42011048	So you are witnesses and consent to the deeds of your fathers , for they killed them and you build their tombs .
42011049	Therefore also the Wisdom of God said , ' I will send to them prophets and apostles , and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute . '
42011050	So the blood of all the prophets which has been shed from the foundation of the world will be required of this generation —
42011051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the House . Yes , I tell you , it will be required of this generation .
42011052	Alas for you lawyers ! because you have taken away the key of knowledge . You yourselves have not entered and you have prevented those who were entering . "
42011053	After he went away from there , the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon him angrily and cross-question him on many points ,
42011054	laying traps to catch something from his mouth .
42012001	MEANWHILE , as the myriads of the crowd were thronging together so that they trod down one another , he began and said to his disciples first , " Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees , that is , their hypocrisy .
42012002	For nothing is covered up which will not be revealed , nor secret which will not be known .
42012003	Whatever you have said in darkness will , on the contrary , be heard in the light , and what you have spoken into the ear in inner moms will be proclaimed on the housetops .
42012004	I tell you , my friends , never fear those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do .
42012005	But I will show you whom you should fear . Fear him who , after he has killed , has power to cast into Gehenna . Yes , I say , fear him .
42012006	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God .
42012007	But even the hairs of your head are all numbered . Never fear ; you are worth more than many sparrows .
42012008	But I tell you every one who confesses me before men , him will the Son of Man confess before the angels of God .
42012009	And he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God .
42012010	Every one who speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but he who says profane words against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	When they bring you in before synagogues and magistrates and authorities , do not be anxious about how to defend yourselves or what to say .
42012012	For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what you must say . "
42012013	One out of the crowd said to him , " Teacher , bid my brother to divide the inheritance with me . "
42012014	But he said , " Man , who appointed me judge or divider over you ? "
42012015	He said to them , " See to it and be on your guard against every form of covetousness , for not even when one has a superabundance is his life from the things he owns . "
42012016	He gave them an illustration , saying , " The ground of a certain rich man yielded abundantly .
42012017	He debated within himself , saying , ' What shall I do ? for I have no place to store my crops . '
42012018	Then he said , ' I will do this : I will pull down my barns and will build larger ones , and there I will store all my wheat and my goods ;
42012019	and I will say to my soul , Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years , take your ease , eat , drink , be merry ! '
42012020	But God said to him , ' Foolish man , this night your soul will be required of you ; and the things that you have prepared — whose will they be ? '
42012021	So is he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God . "
42012022	He said to his disciples , " Therefore I tell you , never worry about your life , what you are to eat , nor about your body , what you are to put on .
42012023	For the life is more than the food and the body is more than the clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens , for they neither sow nor reap ; they have neither granary nor barn ; yet God feeds them . How much more you are worth than the birds !
42012025	Which of you can by worrying add a foot to his height ?
42012026	If you cannot do the least , why do you worry about the rest ?
42012027	Consider the lilies , how they neither spin nor weave . Yet I tell you even Solomon in all his splendor was not arrayed like one of these .
42012028	But if God so clothes the herbage which to-day is in the field and to-morrow is thrown into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O men of little faith !
42012029	Do not seek after something to eat and something to drink , and do not be agitated by cares .
42012030	For these things all the nations of the world are seeking after .
42012031	But strive for his kingdom and these things will be provided for you .
42012032	Never fear , little flock ! For it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell what you have and give gifts of mercy . Make for yourselves purses that never grow old , an unfailing treasure in heaven where no thief approaches nor moth consumes ;
42012034	for where your treasure is there your heart will be .
42012035	Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning ;
42012036	and be like men expecting their Master when he returns from the wedding , so that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately .
42012037	Blessed are those servants whom the Master , when he comes , will find watching ! Truly I tell you he will gird himself and make them recline at the table and will come and wait on them .
42012038	If he comes in the second watch or in the third watch and finds them so , blessed are they !
42012039	But know this , if the householder had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would not have let his house be broken into .
42012040	And you be ready , for in an hour that you do not think the Son of Man is coming . "
42012041	Peter said , " Master , do you intend this illustration for us or for all ? "
42012042	The Master said , " Who then is the faithful , the wise , manager whom the master will appoint over his establishment to give out rations at the proper time ?
42012043	Blessed is that servant whom his master , when he comes , will find so doing !
42012044	I tell you truly he will appoint him over all his possessions .
42012045	But if that servant says in his heart , ' My master will be long in coming , ' and begins to strike the men servants and the maids and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
42012046	the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting and at an hour that he does not know , and will cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unfaithful .
42012047	That servant who knew his master's will and is not ready , and has not done according to his will , will be beaten with many lashes .
42012048	But he who did not know and yet has done things worthy of lashes will be beaten with few . From every one to whom much was given , much will be required , and from him to whom they have committed much , men will ask the more .
42012049	" I came to cast fire on the earth , and what will I , if it is already kindled ?
42012050	I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how am I distressed until it is accomplished !
42012051	Do you think that I came to give peace on the earth ? No , I tell you , but dissension .
42012052	There will be from now on five in one house split into parties , three against two and two against three ,
42012053	father against son , and son against father , mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law , and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . "
42012054	He said also to the crowds , " When you see a cloud rising in the west , at once you say , ' A shower is coming , ' and so it happens .
42012055	And when you see the south wind blowing , you say , ' There will be burning heat , ' and so it happens .
42012056	Hypocrites , you know how to interpret the face of the earth and the sky , why do you not interpret this crisis ?
42012057	Why do you not of yourselves judge correctly ?
42012058	As you are going with your opponent to the magistrate , take pains on the road to get free from him , so that he may not drag you before the judge and the judge deliver you to the officer and the officer cast you into prison .
42012059	I tell you you will not come out until you pay in full to the last penny . "
42013001	AT that time some were present telling him about the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
42013002	He answered them , " Do you think that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans because they suffered this ?
42013003	No , I tell you , but unless you have a change of heart , you will all perish in the same way .
42013004	Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them , do you think that they were deserving of punishment beyond all the people that dwell at Jerusalem ?
42013005	No , I tell you , but unless you have a change of heart , you will all perish just the same . "
42013006	He gave this illustration : " A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and came looking for fruit on it and found none .
42013007	He said to the gardener , ' See , three years I have been coming , looking for fruit on this fig tree , and I do not find any . Gut it down . Why should we waste land for it ? '
42013008	But he answered him , ' Leave it this year too , Sir , until I dig around it and throw on manure .
42013009	Then , if it yields fruit in the future , all right . But if not , then you shall cut it down . '
42013010	He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
42013011	And a woman was there who had had a spirit of weakness eighteen years , and was bent together and could not stand up straight .
42013012	When Jesus saw her he called to her and said , " Woman , you have been freed from your weakness , "
42013013	and he laid his hands on her . Immediately she was straightened and gave glory to God .
42013014	But the synagogue Director , angry because Jesus was healing on the Sabbath , said to the crowd , " There are six days in which work should be done . On those days come and be healed , but not on the Sabbath day . "
42013015	The Master answered him , " Hypocrite , does not each of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger and lead him away and water him ?
42013016	And ought not this woman , a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan had bound for eighteen years , to have been freed from this bond on the Sabbath day ? "
42013017	As he said this , all his opposers were ashamed , and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things that he did .
42013018	He said , " To what is the kingdom of God like ? To what shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden . It grew and became a tree and the birds of heaven lodged in its branches . "
42013020	Again he said , " To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like yeast which a woman took and hid in three pecks of flour until the whole was leavened . "
42013022	He was journeying through the cities and villages teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem .
42013023	A man said to him , " Master , are there few that are saved ? " He said to them ,
42013024	" Try hard to enter through the narrow door ; for many , I tell you , will try to enter and will not be able .
42013025	After the house-holder has arisen and has shut the door , then you will begin to stand outside and knock at the door , and say , ' Master , open to us . ' And he will answer you , ' I do not know you or where you come from . '
42013026	Then you will begin and say , ' We have eaten and drunk before you and you have taught in our streets . '
42013027	And he will say to you , ' I do not know where you come from . Go away from me , all you workers of wickedness . '
42013028	There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and yourselves thrust outside .
42013029	People will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and recline at the table in the kingdom of God .
42013030	Indeed , there are last who will be first and there are first who will be last . "
42013031	At that time there came to him some Pharisees , saying , " Go out and leave this place , for Herod purposes to kill you . "
42013032	He said to them , " Go tell that fox , ' See , I am casting out demons and performing cures to-day and to-morrow , and on the third day I will finish . '
42013033	But I must journey to-day , and to-morrow and the next day , for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem .
42013034	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you , how often would I have gathered your children as a bird gathers her brood under her wings , and you would not have it !
42013035	See , your house is left to you ! I tell you , you will not see me until the day when you say , ' Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
42014001	ONCE , when he went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread , they were watching him closely .
42014002	And there before him was a man who had dropsy .
42014003	Jesus said to the lawyers and Pharisees , " Is it allowable to heal on the Sabbath or is it not ? "
42014004	They kept quiet . Then taking hold of him he cured him and dismissed him .
42014005	He said to them , " If the son or the ox of any one of you falls into a well on the Sabbath day , will he not at once draw him out ? "
42014006	They could not say anything in answer to this .
42014007	Observing how the guests were choosing the best couches , he gave them an illustration :
42014008	" When you are invited by any one to a wedding , do not recline on the best couch , for some one more honored than you may have been invited ,
42014009	and when he who invited you and him comes he may say to you , ' Give place to this man , ' and then you will with shame begin and take the humblest place .
42014010	But when you are invited , go and recline in the humblest place , so that when he who has invited you comes he may say , ' Friend , come up higher . ' Then you will have honor before all your fellow guests .
42014011	For every one who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted . "
42014012	He said , too , to the man who had invited him , " When you make a breakfast or a dinner , do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives , or your rich neighbors , for they may invite you in return and you may be repaid .
42014013	But when you hold a reception , invite poor men , maimed men , lame men , blind men .
42014014	And you will be blessed , because they cannot repay you , and you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just . "
42014015	On hearing this , one of his fellow guests said to him , " Blessed will he be who eats bread in the kingdom of God ! "
42014016	Jesus said to him , " A certain man made a great dinner and invited many ,
42014017	and sent his servant at the hour of the dinner to tell the guests , ' Come , for things are now ready . '
42014018	But they all began with one mind to make excuse . The first said to him , ' I have bought a field and must go and see it . I beg of you to have me excused . '
42014019	Another said , ' I have bought five yoke of oxen and I am going to try them . I beg of you , have me excused . '
42014020	Another said , ' I have married a wife and on that account I cannot come . '
42014021	The servant came back and told his master these things . Then the householder , becoming angry , said to his servant , ' Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and lead in here the poor and maimed and blind and lame . '
42014022	The servant said , ' Master , what you ordered has been done and still there is room . '
42014023	The master said to the servant , ' Go out into the roads and hedges and make them come in , so that my house may be filled .
42014024	I tell you not one of those men that were invited shall taste of my dinner . ' "
42014025	Great crowds were traveling along with him , and he turned and said to them ,
42014026	" If any one comes to me and does not hate his father and his mother and his wife and his children and his brothers and his sisters , yes , and his own life also , he cannot be a disciple of mine .
42014027	Whoever does not take up his own cross and come after me cannot be a disciple of mine .
42014028	For which of you wishing to build a tower does not first sit down and compute the cost , whether he has enough to complete it ,
42014029	for fear that , after he has laid the foundation and cannot finish it , all the onlookers may begin to ridicule him ,
42014030	saying , ' This man began to build and could not finish . '
42014031	Or what king going to meet another king in war does not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who is coming against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	If not , while the other is still far off he sends an embassy and asks for conditions of peace .
42014033	Just so no one of you who does not renounce all that he has can be a disciple of mine .
42014034	Salt is good , but if the salt becomes tasteless , with what shall it be seasoned ?
42014035	It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap . They throw it away . Let him who has ears to hear , hear . "
42015001	ALL the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to him in order to hear him .
42015002	The Pharisees and the scribes grumbled to one another , " This man welcomes sinners and eats with them . "
42015003	He gave them this illustration :
42015004	" What man of you , if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he has found it ?
42015005	And when he has found it he lays it on his shoulders with joy ,
42015006	and when he comes home he calls together his friends and neighbors and says , ' Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep that was lost ! '
42015007	I tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner whose heart is changed than over ninety-nine righteous men who have no need to change .
42015008	" Or what woman who has ten shillings , if she loses one shilling , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look for it carefully until she finds it ?
42015009	And when she finds it , she calls together her friends and neighbors and says , ' Rejoice with me , for I have found the shilling that I lost . '
42015010	So I tell you there springs joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner whose heart is changed . "
42015011	He said further , " A certain man had two sons .
42015012	And the younger of them said to his father , ' Father , give me the portion of the property that is coming to me . ' So he divided his wealth between them .
42015013	Not many days later , the younger son got everything together and went away to a far country and there squandered his property in a dissolute life .
42015014	When he had spent everything , there came a terrible famine in that land and he began to be in want .
42015015	So he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to feed swine .
42015016	And he would fain have filled his stomach with the pods the swine were eating , but no one gave him anything .
42015017	Then , coming to himself , he said , ' How many hired men of my father have bread more than enough , and here I am perishing with famine .
42015018	I will arise and go to my father and will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you .
42015019	I am no longer worthy to be called your son . Make me as one of your hired men . '
42015020	And he arose and came to his father . But while he was still far off , his father saw him and pitied him , and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him tenderly .
42015021	The son said to him , ' Father , I have sinned against heaven and before you . I am no longer worthy to be called your son ' —
42015022	But the father said to his servants , ' Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet ;
42015023	and bring the fattened calf and kill it , and let us eat and make merry .
42015024	For this , my son , was dead and has come to life ; he was lost and has been found . ' And they began to be merry .
42015025	Now his older son was in the field , and when on returning he drew near the house he heard music and dancing .
42015026	Calling to him one of the servants , he inquired what this was . The servant said to him ,
42015027	' Your brother has come and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back in health . '
42015028	But he grew angry , and would not go in . Then his father came out and begged him .
42015029	But he answered his father , ' See , all these years I have been serving you , and I never broke a command of yours , yet you have never given me a kid to make merry with my friends .
42015030	But when this son of yours , who has wasted your property with bad women , came , you have killed for him the fattened calf . '
42015031	But the father said to him , ' Child , you are always with me and all that I have is yours .
42015032	We could not but make merry and rejoice , for your brother here was dead and has come to life ; he was lost and is found . '
42016001	HE said to his disciples , " A certain rich man had a manager who was accused to him of wasting his property .
42016002	Calling him to him , he said , ' What is this that I hear about you ? Give an account of your management ; for you cannot longer be manager . '
42016003	The manager said to himself , ' What shall I do ? for my master is going to take the management away from me . I have not strength to dig ; I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what I will do , so that when I am dismissed from the management they may welcome me into their houses . '
42016005	So , calling to him all of the debtors of his master , he said to the first , ' How much do you owe to my master ? '
42016006	He replied , ' A hundred measures of oil . ' He said , ' Take your account and sit down quickly and write fifty . '
42016007	Then to another he said , ' And you , how much do you owe ? ' He replied , ' A hundred measures of wheat . ' He said to him , ' Take your account and write eighty . '
42016008	The master praised the wicked manager because he had done prudently . For the sons of this world are with reference to their own generation wiser than the sons of light .
42016009	I tell you , make for yourselves friends with the Mammon of unrighteousness , so that when it fails they may welcome you into the eternal tents .
42016010	He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much , and he who is dishonest in the least is also dishonest in much .
42016011	If , then , you have not been faithful in the dishonest Mammon , who will entrust to you the true ?
42016012	And if you were not faithful in what was another's , who will give you what is your own ?
42016013	No house servant can serve two masters . For either he will hate one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and Mammon . "
42016014	The Pharisees , who were lovers of money , were listening to all this and they were sneering at him .
42016015	He said to them , " You are those who justify yourselves before men , but God knows your hearts . For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination before God .
42016016	" The Law and the Prophets were until John . From that time the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed and every one is forcing his way into it .
42016017	" It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail .
42016018	" Every one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
42016019	" A certain man was rich and was clothed in purple and fine linen and lived merrily every day in splendor .
42016020	And a certain poor man by the name of Lazarus had been laid at his gate , full of sores
42016021	and longing to be fed from what fell from the rich man's table . Even the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	It happened that the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom . The rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	And in Hades he lifted up his eyes , being in torments , and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom .
42016024	He called and said , ' Father Abraham , have compassion on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue ; for I am in anguish in this flame . '
42016025	But Abraham said , ' Child , remember that you had your good things in full in your lifetime , and Lazarus likewise had his evil things . Now he is here receiving comfort and you are in anguish .
42016026	Moreover , between us and you a great chasm has been fixed , so that those who wish to cross from here to you cannot , nor can any cross from there to us . '
42016027	But he said , ' I beg you , then , Father , to send him to my father's house ,
42016028	for I have five brothers , in order to testify to them , so that they may not come also to this place of torment . '
42016029	Abraham said , ' They have Moses and the prophets . Let them listen to them . '
42016030	But he said , ' No , father Abraham , but if one goes to them from the dead , they will have a change of heart . '
42016031	Abraham replied , ' If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rises from the dead . '
42017001	HE said to his disciples , " It cannot be but that occasions of stumbling will arise , but alas for him through whom they come !
42017002	It would be better for him if , with a millstone hung around his neck , he had been flung into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble .
42017003	" Be on your guard . If your brother sins against you , reprove him , and if he changes his mind , forgive him .
42017004	Even if seven times in the day he sins against you and seven times turns to you , saying , ' I repent , ' forgive him . "
42017005	The apostles said to the Master , " Increase our faith . "
42017006	The Master said , " If you had faith like a mustard seed , you would say to this mulberry tree , ' Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you .
42017007	" Who is there of you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say to him when he comes in from the field , ' Come quickly and recline at table ' ?
42017008	On the contrary , will he not say to him , ' Make ready something for my dinner and gird yourself and wait on me while I eat and drink , and after that you may eat and drink yourself ' ?
42017009	Does he thank the servant because he did what he was told ?
42017010	Just so you , when you have done all that has been commanded you , say , ' We are useless servants ; we have done merely what we ought to have done . ' "
42017011	It happened that on his journey toward Jerusalem he was going through Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he was approaching a certain village , ten leprous men met him . They stood at a distance ,
42017013	and , raising their voices , called , " Jesus , Master , have compassion on us . "
42017014	When Jesus saw them , he said , " Go and show yourselves to the priests . " While they were going , they became clean .
42017015	One of them , seeing that he had been cured , turned back with a loud shout giving glory to God ,
42017016	and he fell on his face at the feet of Jesus , thanking him . He was a Samaritan .
42017017	Jesus said , " Were not ten cleansed ? But the nine — where are they ?
42017018	Was there none found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner ? "
42017019	He said to him , " Rise and go . Your faith has healed you . "
42017020	On being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming , Jesus answered them , " The kingdom of God will not come in a way that can be observed ,
42017021	nor will they say , ' Here it is ! ' or , ' There it is ! ' For indeed the kingdom of God is among you . "
42017022	He said to the disciples , " There will come days when you will wish to see one of the days of the Son of Man and you will not see it .
42017023	They will say to you , ' See here ! ' or , ' See there ! ' but do not start off or go in pursuit .
42017024	For as the lightning when it flashes shines from one part of the heavens to the other , so will the Son of Man be in his day .
42017025	But first he must suffer many things , and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	As it happened in the days of Noah , so will it be in the days of the Son of Man .
42017027	They were eating and drinking , marrying and being given in marriage , until the day that Noah went into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	Just so it was in the days of Lot ; they were eating and drinking , buying and selling , planting and building .
42017029	But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all .
42017030	So will the Son of Man be on the day that he is revealed .
42017031	On that day , if a man is on the housetop and his things in the house , he must not come down to get them , and for the same reason if he is in the field he must not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot's wife .
42017033	Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it , and whoever loses it will save it .
42017034	I tell you that night there will be two men in one bed ; one will be taken with him and the other will be left .
42017035	There will be two women grinding at the same mill , one will be taken with him and the other will be left . "
42017037	They said to him , " Where , Master ? " He said to them , " Where the carcass is , there will the vultures come flocking together . "
42018001	HE gave them an illustration that they ought always to pray and not to lose courage .
42018002	He said , " There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God or regard man .
42018003	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying , ' Give me justice against my adversary . '
42018004	For a time he would not . Later he said to himself , ' Even though I do not fear God nor regard man ,
42018005	yet because this widow is annoying me I will do her justice so that she may not keep coming and mauling me forever . '
42018006	The Master said , " Hear what the wicked judge says ;
42018007	and will not God do justice for his elect , who are calling to him day and night , even though he is long-suffering with their adversaries ?
42018008	I tell you , he will do justice for them speedily . But when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? "
42018009	He gave also this illustration to some who trusted in themselves as being righteous and despised others :
42018010	" Two men went up to the Temple courts to pray . One was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , ' God , I thank thee that I am not like the rest of men , extortioners , cheats , adulterers , or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week . I give tithes of all I get . '
42018013	But the tax collector stood far off and would not even lift his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God be merciful to me , the sinner ! '
42018014	I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other . For every one who exalts himself will be humbled , and he who humbles himself will be exalted . "
42018015	They were bringing to him babes for him to touch . The disciples on seeing this rebuked them .
42018016	But Jesus called the children to him , saying , " Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them ; for of such is the kingdom of God .
42018017	Truly , I tell you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will not enter it . "
42018018	One of the rulers asked him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit life eternal ? "
42018019	Jesus said to him , " Why do you call me good ? No one is good except one — God .
42018020	You know the commandments : Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not commit murder , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness , Honor thy father and thy mother . "
42018021	He said , " All these I have kept from my boyhood up . "
42018022	On hearing that , Jesus said to him , " You lack still one thing . Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven , and then come and follow me . "
42018023	But he , on hearing this , became deeply sorrowful , for he was very rich .
42018024	Jesus looked at him and said , " With how much difficulty do those who have riches enter the kingdom of God !
42018025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God ! "
42018026	Those who heard it said , " Then who can be saved ? "
42018027	He said , " The things that are impossible with men are possible with God . "
42018028	Peter said , " See , we have left our property and have followed you . "
42018029	He said to them , " I tell you truly there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
42018030	who will not receive many times more in this world , and in the world to come life eternal . "
42018031	Taking the twelve aside , he said to them , " We are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things written through the prophets will be fully done to the Son of Man .
42018032	For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and he will be made sport of and insulted and spit upon ,
42018033	and they will scourge him and kill him , and on the third day he will rise . "
42018034	But they understood none of these things , and what he said was hidden from them . They did not grasp the meaning of his words .
42018035	As he approached Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
42018036	Hearing a crowd passing , he inquired what this was .
42018037	They told him , " Jesus , the Nazarene , is passing by . "
42018038	Then he shouted , " Jesus , son of David , have pity on me ! "
42018039	Those who were in front rebuked him and told him to be still . But he kept crying out much louder , " Son of David , have pity on me ! "
42018040	Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be led to him . When he had come up , Jesus asked him ,
42018041	" What do you want me to do for you ? " He said , " Sir , I want my sight . "
42018042	Jesus said to him , " See . Your faith has healed you . "
42018043	Immediately he received sight and followed him , giving glory to God . All the people upon seeing this gave praise to God .
42019001	HE entered and was passing through Jericho .
42019002	In the city there was a man called Zacchaeus , who was chief of the tax collectors and was rich .
42019003	He was trying to see Jesus — what he was like ; but he could not on account of the crowd , for he was short in stature .
42019004	So running ahead he climbed up into a mulberry tree to see him , for he was going to pass that way .
42019005	When Jesus came to the place , he looked up and said to him , " Zaccheus , make haste and come down ; to-day I must stay at your house . "
42019006	He hurriedly descended and welcomed him joyfully .
42019007	All who saw it grumbled , saying that Jesus was going in to stay with a sinner .
42019008	Zacchaeus stood and said to the Master , " See , the half of my property , Sir , I give to the poor , and if I have unjustly taken anything from any one , I will give him back four-fold . "
42019009	Jesus said to him , " To-day salvation has come to this house , since he also is a son of Abraham .
42019010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost . "
42019011	While they were listening to this , he added an illustration , because he was near to Jerusalem and they were thinking that the kingdom of heaven was going to appear immediately .
42019012	He said , " A certain nobleman went into a far country to get for himself a kingdom and return .
42019013	Calling his ten servants , he gave them each an equal sum of money and said to them , ' Do business until I come . '
42019014	But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him to say , ' We do not want this man to be king over us . '
42019015	When he returned , having secured the royal power , he ordered those servants to whom he had given the silver to be called to him that he might know what each had gained in trading .
42019016	The first came saying , ' Sir , your money has gained tenfold . '
42019017	He said , ' Well done , good servant , because you were faithful in the least you shall be ruler over ten cities . '
42019018	Then came the second , saying , ' Your money , Sir , has made fivefold . '
42019019	He said to this one , ' And you shall be over five cities . '
42019020	Another one came , saying , ' Sir , here is your silver , which I kept laid away in a napkin .
42019021	For I feared you , because you are an austere man ; you take up what you did not lay down and you reap where you did not sow . '
42019022	He said to him , ' Out of your own mouth I will judge you , you wicked servant . Did you know that I was an austere man , taking up what I did not lay down and reaping where I did not sow ?
42019023	Then why did you not put my silver into the bank , so that when I came I could have exacted it with interest ? '
42019024	Then to those who stood by he said , ' Take from him the silver and give it to him who has tenfold . '
42019025	They said to him , ' Sir , he has tenfold . '
42019026	' I tell you , ' he said , ' that to every one who has , shall be given , and from him who has not , even what he has shall be taken .
42019027	But those enemies of mine , who did not want me to be king over them , bring here and slaughter them before me . '
42019028	When he had said these things , he journeyed onward , going up toward Jerusalem .
42019029	When they approached Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called the Olive Orchard , he sent two of his disciples ,
42019030	telling them , " Go into the village across there , and as you enter it you will find a colt tied upon which no man has ever sat . Loose it and lead it here .
42019031	If any one asks you , ' Why are you loosing it ? ' say , ' The Master has need of it . ' "
42019032	Those who were sent went and found everything just as he had said to them .
42019033	While they were loosing the colt , its owners said to them , " Why are you loosing the colt ? "
42019034	They said , " The Master has need of it . "
42019035	They led it to Jesus and threw their cloaks on the colt and mounted Jesus on it .
42019036	As he advanced , some spread their cloaks in the road ,
42019037	and as he approached the descent of the Mount of Olives all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God in a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen ,
42019038	saying : " Blessed be he who comes as king , in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory in the heights above ! "
42019039	Some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him , " Teacher , rebuke your disciples . "
42019040	But he said , " I tell you if these become silent , the stones will cry out . "
42019041	As he drew near and looked at the city , he wept over it ,
42019042	saying , " If this day you also knew the things that make for peace ! But now they are hidden from your eyes !
42019043	For days will come when your enemies will throw up a palisade against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side
42019044	and level you to the ground , and your children within you , and they will not leave one stone upon another in you , because you did not know the time when you were visited . "
42019045	Entering into the Temple courts he began and drove out the dealers ,
42019046	saying to them , " It is written , ' My house shall be a house of prayer , ' but you have made it a den of robbers . "
42019047	He was teaching every day in the Temple courts . But the high priests and the scribes were bent on destroying him , and so were the first citizens .
42019048	But they could find no way to do it ; for all the people hung upon him listening .
42020001	ON one of those days , as he was teaching the people in the Temple courts and proclaiming the good news , the high priests and the scribes came up with the elders
42020002	and said to him , " Tell us by what authority you are doing these things or who it is that gave you this authority . "
42020003	He answered them , " I too will ask you a question and you must tell me :
42020004	the baptism of John , was it from heaven or from men ? "
42020005	They conferred among themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
42020006	and if we say , ' From men , ' all the people will stone us ; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . "
42020007	So they answered that they did not know where it came from .
42020008	Jesus said to them , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things . "
42020009	He began and gave the people this illustration : " A man planted a vineyard and let it out to grape-growers and went abroad for a long time .
42020010	At the proper season he sent to the grape-growers a servant for them to give him a part of the fruit of the vineyard . But the grape-growers beat him , and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	He afterwards sent another servant . That one , too , they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed .
42020012	Then he sent a third . But this one , too , they wounded and threw out .
42020013	The owner of the vineyard said , ' I will send my son , my beloved . Perhaps they will reverence him . '
42020014	But when the grape-growers saw him , they conferred with one another and said , ' This is the heir . Let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours . '
42020015	So they threw him outside of the vineyard and killed him . What now will the owner of the vineyard do ?
42020016	He will come and destroy those grape-growers and will give the vineyard to others . " When they heard this , they exclaimed , " May it never be ! "
42020017	He turned his eyes upon them and said , " What does this Scripture mean , ' The stone which the builders rejected — that one has become the corner stone ' ?
42020018	Every one who falls upon that stone will be shattered , but whomever it falls on it will crush to pieces . "
42020019	The scribes and the high priests were eager to lay hands on him at that very time , for they knew that he had aimed the illustration at them ; but they were afraid of the people .
42020020	So watching insidiously for an opportunity they sent spies , who pretended to be honest men , to seize upon anything he might say , so as to hand him over to the authorities and to the power of the Governor .
42020021	They asked him , " Teacher , we know that you speak and teach correctly and that you do not regard personal influences , but you teach the way of God according to truth .
42020022	Is it right for us to give tribute to Caesar or not ? "
42020023	He saw through their cunning and said to them ,
42020024	" Show me a coin . Whose head and inscription does it have on it ? " They said , " Caesar's . "
42020025	He said to them , " Then pay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and pay to God what belongs to God . "
42020026	They could not seize upon his words before the people , and in astonishment at his answer they were silent .
42020027	There came to him some of the Sadducees , who deny that there is any resurrection , and asked him ,
42020028	" Teacher , Moses wrote for us , ' If any one's married brother dies childless , that man must marry his brother's widow and raise up offspring for his brother . '
42020029	Well , there were seven brothers . The first took a wife and died childless .
42020030	The second
42020031	and the third and the rest of the seven took her and died leaving no children .
42020032	Finally the woman also died .
42020033	Now this woman — whose wife will she be at the resurrection ? For she was wife to the seven . "
42020034	Jesus said to them , " The children of this world marry and are married ,
42020035	but those who are judged worthy to reach that world and the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are married ,
42020036	neither can they die , for they are like angels and are children of God , since they are children of the resurrection .
42020037	But that the dead rise Moses has made known in the passage regarding the Bush where he calls the Lord ' the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob . '
42020038	He is not a God of dead men , but of living men . For all are alive to him . "
42020039	Some of the scribes answered him , " Teacher , you have spoken well . "
42020040	And they no longer dared to ask him anything .
42020041	He said to them , " How do they say that the Christ is the son of David ?
42020042	David himself says in the book of Psalms , ' The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right
42020043	until I make your enemies your footstool . '
42020044	So David calls him ' Lord ' ; how is he then his son ? "
42020045	While all the people were listening , he said to the disciples ,
42020046	" Beware of the scribes , who like to walk in long robes and love salutations in the market-places and front seats in the synagogues and the best couches at dinners ,
42020047	who devour widows ' houses and in pretense make long prayers . These will receive unusual condemnation . "
42021001	Looking up , he saw those who were dropping their gifts into the contribution box , the rich people .
42021002	But he saw a poor widow dropping in two mites ,
42021003	and he said , " Truly I tell you this widow , poor as she is , has dropped in more than all .
42021004	For they all out of their abundance contributed to the gifts , but she out of her lack put in all that she had to live on . "
42021005	As some were speaking about the Temple buildings , how they were decorated with beautiful stones and votive gifts ,
42021006	he said , " As to these things that you are looking at , there will come days in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be thrown down . "
42021007	They asked him , " Teacher , when will these things be ? And what will be the sign when they are about to happen ? "
42021008	He said , " Be on your guard against being misled . For many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he , ' and , ' The time is at hand . ' Do not follow them .
42021009	And when you hear of wars and disorders , do not be terrified . For these things must take place first , but the end will not come immediately . "
42021010	Then he said to them , " Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom ,
42021011	and there will be great earthquakes in various places , and pestilences and famines and terrors and great portents from heaven .
42021012	Before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you , handing you over to the synagogues and into prisons , dragging you before kings and governors because of my name .
42021013	It will turn out your opportunity for testimony .
42021014	Settle it , then , in your hearts not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves .
42021015	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your opponents will be unable to resist or reply to .
42021016	You will be betrayed by parents and brothers and relatives and friends , and some of you will be put to death
42021017	and you will be hated by all on account of my name .
42021018	Yet not a hair of your head will perish .
42021019	By your endurance you will win your lives .
42021020	" But when you see Jerusalem encircled by camps , then know that her desolation is near .
42021021	Then those who are in Judaea are to flee to the mountains , and those in the midst of it are to depart , and those in the country places must not come into the city ;
42021022	for these are days of vengeance , that all the prophecies may be fulfilled .
42021023	Alas for the women with child and the nursing mothers in those days ! For there will be great distress on earth and wrath upon this people ,
42021024	and they will fall by the edge of the sword and will be taken as captives into all the nations . And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles have gone by .
42021025	" There will be portents in the sun and in the moon and in the stars , and on earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roar of the sea and its surges ,
42021026	men fainting from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon mankind . For the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42021027	And then they will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud with power and great glory .
42021028	When these things are beginning to happen , look up and lift up your heads , for your liberation is drawing near . "
42021029	He gave them an illustration : " See the fig tree , and all the trees .
42021030	When they put out leaves , you see for yourselves that summer is near .
42021031	So , too , when you see these things happening , know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	Truly , I tell you , this generation will not pass away before all takes place .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will not pass away .
42021034	Take care that your hearts are not dull through overeating and drinking and the cares of life , so that that day may come on you unexpectedly like a trap .
42021035	For it will come on all who dwell on the face of all the earth .
42021036	Be watchful at every season in prayer that you may be able to escape all these things that will happen , and to stand before the Son of Man . "
42021037	During the days he continued to teach in the Temple courts , but every night he went out and stayed on the mount called Olive Orchard .
42021038	All the people came early every morning to him in the Temple courts to listen to him .
42022001	THE Feast of Unleavened Bread , which is called the Passover , was approaching .
42022002	The high priests and the scribes were intent upon finding some way to destroy Jesus ; for they were afraid of the people .
42022003	But Satan entered into Judas , called Iscariot , who was of the number of the twelve ,
42022004	and he went away and talked over with the high priests and officers how he could betray him .
42022005	They were delighted and agreed to give him money .
42022006	He promised , and was on the lookout for an opportunity to betray him to them when the crowd was not with him .
42022007	The day of unleavened bread came , when the Passover lamb must be sacrificed ,
42022008	and Jesus sent Peter and John , telling them , " Go and make ready the Passover for us so that we may eat it . "
42022009	They said to him , " Where do you wish us to make ready ? "
42022010	He said , " As you are entering the city a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water . Follow him into the house that he enters
42022011	and say to the master of the house , ' The Teacher says to you , Where is the dining room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples ? '
42022012	And he will show you an upper room , large and furnished . There make ready . "
42022013	They went away and found everything just as he had said , and they prepared the Passover .
42022014	When the hour came , he reclined at table and the apostles with him .
42022015	He said to them , " I have strongly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
42022016	For , I tell you , I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . "
42022017	He took a cup and gave thanks and said , " Take this and share it among yourselves .
42022018	For , I say to you , I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes . "
42022019	Then he took a loaf and gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . Do this in memory of me . "
42022020	He took the cup in the same manner after supper , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood , which is shed for you .
42022021	But , see , the hand of the traitor is with me on the table !
42022022	The Son of Man is going , as it is appointed , but alas for that man by whom he is betrayed ! "
42022023	They began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do this .
42022024	There was also a dispute among them as to which of them should be regarded as superior .
42022025	He said to them , " The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them , and those of them who exercise authority are called benefactors .
42022026	But you are not to be so . The greatest among you is to be like the youngest and the leader like him who serves .
42022027	For which is superior , he who reclines at table or he who serves ? Is not he who reclines ? But I am in the midst of you as the one who serves .
42022028	You are those who have stood by me in my trials
42022029	and I will assign to you , as my Father has assigned to me , a kingdom ,
42022030	that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom . You shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	Simon , Simon , Satan has begged to be allowed to sift all of you like wheat .
42022032	But I have prayed for thee that thy faith may not fail . And when you come back to yourself , strengthen your brothers . "
42022033	Peter said to him , " Master , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death . "
42022034	Jesus said , " I tell you , Peter , the cock will not crow to-day before you three times deny that you know me . "
42022035	He said to them , " When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes , did you lack for anything ? " They said , " We lacked for nothing . "
42022036	He said to them , " But now whoever has a purse must take it , and so with a bag , and he who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one .
42022037	For I tell you that the prophecy must be fulfilled in me — the prophecy , ' He was numbered among the lawless . ' For what concerns me is coming to an end . "
42022038	They said , " Master , here are two swords . " He said to them , " That is enough . "
42022039	He went out and made his way , according to his custom , to the Mount of Olives , and the disciples followed him .
42022040	When he came to the place , he said to them , " Pray not to enter into temptation . "
42022041	He parted from them about a stone's throw and kneeled down and prayed ,
42022042	" Father , if thou wilt , take away this cup from me . Yet not my will , but thine , be done . "
42022043	An angel from heaven appeared to him strengthening him .
42022044	Being in agony , he prayed more earnestly , and his sweat became like great drops of blood failing upon the ground .
42022045	Then he rose from prayer and came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow .
42022046	He said to them , " Why are you sleeping ? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation . "
42022047	While he was still speaking there came a crowd , and he who was called Judas , one of the twelve , was leading them . He came up to Jesus to kiss him .
42022048	Jesus said to him , " Judas , is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of Man ? "
42022049	Those about Jesus , seeing what was going to happen , said , " Master , shall we strike with the sword ? "
42022050	One of them did strike the High Priest's servant and cut off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus said , " Let me at least do this , " and he touched his ear and healed it .
42022052	Jesus said to the high priests and officers of the Temple and elders who had come out against him , " You come out with swords and clubs , just as if after a robber .
42022053	In the daytime while I was with you in the Temple courts you did not stretch out your hands to take me . But this is your hour and the power of darkness . "
42022054	After arresting him they led him away and brought him into the house of the High Priest . Peter followed at a distance .
42022055	They lighted a fire in the center of the court and seated themselves around it , and Peter seated himself in the midst of them .
42022056	A maid saw him sitting near the light , and , looking hard at him , said , " This man was with him too . "
42022057	But he denied , saying , " Woman , I do not know him . "
42022058	After a short space another — a man — saw him , and said , " You too are one of them . " But Peter said , " Man , I am not . "
42022059	About an hour later , another man asserted positively , " Truly this man was with him too , for he is a Galilaean . "
42022060	But Peter said , " Man , I do not know what you are talking about . " Immediately while he was speaking the cock crew ,
42022061	and the Master turned and looked at Peter , and Peter remembered the word of the Master , how he had said to him , " Before the cock crows to-day you will disown me three times . "
42022062	And he went out and wept bitterly .
42022063	The men who had arrested Jesus made sport of him , beating him ,
42022064	and , after blindfolding him , they asked him , " Prophesy who it is that struck you . "
42022065	Many other insulting words they said to him .
42022066	When daylight came , the eldership of the people assembled , both high priests and scribes , and they led him to their council , saying ,
42022067	" If you are the Christ , tell us . " He said to them , " If I tell you , you will not believe .
42022068	If I question you , you will not answer .
42022069	But from this time the Son of Man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God . "
42022070	They all said , " You then are the Son of God ? " He said to them , " I am what you say . "
42022071	They said , " Why do we need any more testimony ? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth . "
42023001	THEN the whole assemblage arose and led him to Pilate .
42023002	They began accusing him , saying , " We have found this man corrupting our nation and opposing the payment of tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king . "
42023003	Pilate asked him , " Are you the king of the Jews ? " Jesus answered him , " I am . "
42023004	Pilate said to the high priests and the crowd , " I find nothing criminal in this man . "
42023005	But they were violent in saying , " He stirs up the people , teaching through the whole of Judaea . Starting in Galilee , he is now here . "
42023006	Pilate , on hearing of Galilee , asked if the man was a Galilaean ,
42023007	and when he learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction he sent him to Herod , who was himself also in Jerusalem during those days .
42023008	Herod on seeing Jesus was much pleased because for a long time he had been anxious to see him on account of hearing about him , and he was hoping to see some miracle done by him .
42023009	He questioned him with many words ; but Jesus gave him no answer .
42023010	The high priests and the scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
42023011	Herod along with his soldiers treated him with contempt and after making sport of him and putting a gorgeous robe on him , sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that day . Previously they had been at enmity .
42023013	Pilate called together the high priests and the rulers and the people
42023014	and said to them , " You have brought before me this man as one who misguides the people , and yet I , in examining him before you , have found in this man not one criminal thing of all that you charge against him .
42023015	No more has Herod ; for he has sent him back to us . See , nothing deserving of death has been done by him .
42023016	So I will scourge him and release him . "
42023018	But the whole crowd cried out together , " Put him out of the way and free Barabbas for us ! "
42023020	Again Pilate spoke to them , wishing to release Jesus .
42023021	But they shouted , " Crucify him , crucify him ! "
42023022	For the third time he said to them , " What wrong has he done ? I have found nothing criminal in him . I will therefore scourge him and let him go . "
42023023	But they insisted with loud voices asking to have him crucified , and their voices prevailed .
42023024	So Pilate gave sentence that what they asked should be done .
42023025	He freed the man who for riot and murder had been thrown into prison — the man they asked for ; but Jesus he handed over to their will .
42023026	As they led him away , they took hold of Simon , a Cyrenian coming from the country , and laid on him the cross to bear behind Jesus .
42023027	There followed him a great crowd of people and of women who were beating their breasts and bewailing him .
42023028	Jesus turned and said to them , " Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me ; but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	For days are coming in which they will say , ' Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed a babe ! '
42023030	Then they will begin and say to the mountains , ' Fall on us ! ' and to the hills , ' Hide us ! '
42023031	For if they do these things in the green tree , what will happen in the dry ? "
42023032	There were also two others , criminals , led with him to be put to death .
42023033	When they came to the place called Skull , there they crucified him and the criminals , one on his right and one on his left .
42023034	Jesus said , " Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . " They divided his clothes by casting lots .
42023035	The people stood looking on . The rulers scoffed at him , saying , " He saved others ; let him save himself , if he is the Christ of God , the Chosen . "
42023036	The soldiers made sport of him , coming up and offering him sour wine
42023037	and saying , " If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself ! "
42023038	There was a writing over him , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
42023039	One of the criminals who were crucified insulted him , " Are you not the Christ ? Save yourself and us . "
42023040	But the other rebuked him and said , " Have you no fear of God , since you are under the same sentence ?
42023041	And we are here justly , for we are receiving our due for our deeds . But this man has done nothing wrong . "
42023042	Then he said , " Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom . "
42023043	Jesus said to him , " I tell you truly to-day you will be with me in Paradise . "
42023044	It was now about noon , and darkness came over all the land until three ,
42023045	the sun being eclipsed . And the curtain in the Temple was torn in the middle .
42023046	Then Jesus said in a loud voice , " Father , into thy hands I commit my spirit . " After saying this , he breathed his last .
42023047	When the Centurion saw what had happened , he gave glory to God , saying , " Certainly this was an upright man ! "
42023048	And all the crowds that had stood by looking on the scene , after seeing what happened , turned away beating their breasts .
42023049	All his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee were standing at a distance looking on .
42023050	There was a man named Joseph , a member of the Council , a good and upright man
42023051	who had not participated in their plan and action . He was of Arimathaea , a city of the Judaeans , and was looking for the kingdom of God .
42023052	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42023053	He took it down and wrapped it in fine linen and laid him in a tomb cut in the rock where no one was yet lying .
42023054	It was the day of Preparation and the Sabbath was about to begin .
42023055	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed along and saw the tomb and how his body was laid ,
42023056	and they went back and prepared perfumes and ointments . On the Sabbath they abstained from work according to the commandment .
42024001	BUT on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb , bringing the perfumes which they had prepared .
42024002	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
42024003	and on entering they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	While they were at a loss about this , suddenly two men in glittering robes stood beside them .
42024005	They were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground , but the men said to them , " Why are you looking for the living among the dead ?
42024006	He is not here , but has risen . Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee
42024007	that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and rise on the third day . "
42024008	Then they remembered his words
42024009	and turned back from the tomb and told all this to the eleven and all the rest .
42024010	It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James . The other women with them also told these things to the apostles .
42024011	But these reports seemed in their eyes like idle talk . They did not believe the women .
42024012	But Peter rose and ran to the tomb and stooping down he saw nothing but the linen cloths , and he went away to his place wondering at what had happened .
42024013	On that day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus , seven miles distant from Jerusalem ,
42024014	and they were talking to each other about all these occurrences .
42024015	It happened as they talked and discussed that Jesus himself drew near and walked along with them .
42024016	But their eyes were restrained from recognizing him .
42024017	He said to them , " What are these matters that you are debating with each other as you walk ? " They stood still with sad faces .
42024018	One of them , named Cleopas , said to him , " Are you a stranger living alone in Jerusalem and do you not know the things that have happened there in recent days ? "
42024019	He said to them , " What things ? " They said to him , " The things about Jesus the Nazarene , who was a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people —
42024020	how our high priests and leading men handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him .
42024021	But we were hoping that he was the one who was to redeem Israel . But now , however , the third day is passing since these things took place .
42024022	Yet some women from our company amazed us . They went at dawn to the tomb
42024023	and did not find his body , but came back saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive .
42024024	Some of our company went out to the tomb and found things as the women had said , but they did not see him . "
42024025	Jesus said to them , " O men lacking insight and slow in heart to believe all that the prophets spoke !
42024026	Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter into his glory ? "
42024027	Then , beginning with Moses and all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things about himself .
42024028	They drew near to the village where they were going and he acted as if he were going on .
42024029	But they urged him , saying , " Stay with us , for it is toward evening and the sun is already low . " So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	As he reclined at table with them , he took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to them .
42024031	And their eyes were opened and they recognized him ; but he vanished from their sight .
42024032	They said to each other , " Were not our hearts burning within us when he was talking to us on the road and was explaining the Scriptures to us ? "
42024033	Then , rising that very hour , they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their associates assembled
42024034	and saying , " Really the Lord has risen and he has appeared to Simon . "
42024035	They then narrated what had happened on the road and how they knew him by his breaking the bread .
42024036	While they were talking of these things , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them , " Peace be with you ! "
42024037	They were terrified and much alarmed , and thought that they were seeing a spirit .
42024038	But he said to them , " Why are you troubled ? And why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
42024039	See my hands and my feet — that it is I myself . Feel me and see , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having . "
42024040	Saying this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
42024041	While they still were doubting for joy and wondering , he said to them , " Have you anything here to eat ? "
42024042	They gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
42024043	and he took it and ate before them .
42024044	He said to them , " This is what I said to you while I was still with you , that all the things written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled . "
42024045	Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42024046	and he said to them , " Thus it is written that the Christ is to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day ,
42024047	and in his name change of heart for forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed to all the nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And , see , I am sending upon you the promise of my Father . But you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high . "
42024050	He led them out as far as Bethany and lifted up his hands and blessed them .
42024051	While he was blessing them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven .
42024052	They bowed down before him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
42024053	and were constantly in the Temple courts blessing God .
43001001	IN the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was in the beginning with God .
43001003	All things came into being through him , and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being .
43001004	In him was Life , and the Life was the Light of men .
43001005	And the Light shone in the darkness , but the darkness did not understand it .
43001006	There came a man , sent from God . His name was John .
43001007	He came for testimony , to testify about the Light , that all might believe through him .
43001008	He was not the Light , but he came to testify about the Light .
43001009	The true Light , which enlightens every man , was coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world had come into being through him , yet the world did not know him .
43001011	He came to his own things , but his own men did not receive him .
43001012	All who received him — to them he gave power to become children of God , to those who believe in his name ,
43001013	who were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man , but of God .
43001014	The Word became flesh and tented among us , and we looked upon his glory , glory as of an only son from a father , full of grace and truth .
43001015	John bore witness to him and cried , " This was he of whom I said , ' He who comes after me has become before me , for he was before me . ' "
43001016	For of his fullness we all have received , and grace for grace .
43001017	For the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God ; God the only Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he has interpreted him .
43001019	This is the testimony of John when the Jews of Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him , " Who are you ? "
43001020	He confessed and did not deny , but confessed , " I am not the Christ . "
43001021	They asked him , " What then ? Are you Elijah ? " He said , " I am not . " " Are you the prophet ? " He answered , " No . "
43001022	They said then , " Who are you ? Let us have an answer to give to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? "
43001023	He said , " I am ' the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , ' as Isaiah the prophet said . "
43001024	The men had been sent from the Pharisees .
43001025	They asked him , " Why then do you baptize , if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet ? "
43001026	John answered them , " I baptize with water . In the midst of you stands one whom you do not know —
43001027	the One who is coming after me — for whom I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandal . "
43001028	This happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him , and said , " Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is he of whom I said , ' After me comes a man who has become before me , for he was before me . '
43001031	I did not know him , but I knew that he was to be shown to Israel . For that reason I came baptizing with water . "
43001032	John bore witness , " I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and it remained on him .
43001033	I did not know him , but he who sent me to baptize with water — he said to me , ' He on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining , that is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . '
43001034	And I saw it and have borne witness that this is the Son of God . "
43001035	Again on the next day John was standing with two of his disciples ,
43001036	and , looking at Jesus as he walked , he said , " Behold , the Lamb of God ! "
43001037	The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus .
43001038	Jesus turned and looked at them as they followed , and said to them , " What do you wish ? " They said to him , " Rabbi , where are you staying ? "
43001039	He said to them , " Come and see . " So they came and saw where he was staying , and stayed with him that day . It was then about four in the afternoon .
43001040	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two that heard about Jesus from John and followed him .
43001041	He found first his own brother Simon and said to him , " We have found the Messiah ! "
43001042	He led him to Jesus . Looking at him , Jesus said , " You are Simon , the son of John . You shall be called Cephas " .
43001043	On the next day Jesus decided to go away to Galilee , and he found Philip and said to him , " Follow me . "
43001044	Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and said to him , " We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law and of whom the prophets wrote — Jesus the son of Joseph , from Nazareth . "
43001046	Nathanael said to him , " From Nazareth can there be anything good ? " Philip said to him , " Come and see . "
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and said , " See , here is a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit . "
43001048	Nathanael said to him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered him , " Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . "
43001049	Nathanael answered him , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ; you are the King of Israel ! "
43001050	Jesus answered him , " Because I said to you , ' I saw you underneath the fig tree , ' do you believe ? You will see greater things than this . "
43001051	He added , " Truly , truly , I tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man . "
43002001	ON the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there .
43002002	Jesus also was invited , with his disciples , to the wedding .
43002003	When the wine ran short , Jesus ' mother said to him , " They have no wine . "
43002004	Jesus said to her , " What have you to do with my work , woman ? My hour has not yet come . "
43002005	His mother said to the servants , " Whatever he tells you , do it . "
43002006	There were standing there six stone water jars in accordance with the Jewish custom of purification , holding about twenty or thirty gallons apiece .
43002007	Jesus said to them , " Fill the jars with water . " They filled them to the brim .
43002008	Then he said to them , " Dip out now and carry it to the Master of the feast . " They carried it ,
43002009	and when the Master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine , not knowing where it came from — though the servants who had dipped out the water knew — he called to the bridegroom
43002010	and said to him , " Every man sets on first the fine wine , and when they have drunk freely he sets on the poorer . You have kept the fine wine till now . "
43002011	This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana in Galilee and displayed his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this Jesus went down to Capernaum , he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples , and there they stayed a few days .
43002013	The Passover of the Jews was near , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	Finding in the Temple courts the sellers of cattle and sheep and doves and the money-changers sitting there ,
43002015	he made a whip of cords and drove them all from the courts — all the sheep and the cattle , — and he poured out the small coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables .
43002016	He said to those who were selling doves , " Take these things out . Do not make my Father's house a house of trade . "
43002017	His disciples remembered that it was written , " Zeal for thy house will devour me . "
43002018	The Jews said to him , " What sign do you show us , since you act in this way ? "
43002019	Jesus answered them , " Demolish this Temple and in three days I will raise it again . "
43002020	The Jews said , " It took forty-six years to build this Temple , and will you raise it in three days ? "
43002021	But he was speaking of the temple of his body .
43002022	So when he arose from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this , and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken .
43002023	When he was in Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover , many believed in his name , seeing his signs that he did ,
43002024	but Jesus did not trust himself to them because he knew all men
43002025	and had no need for any one to inform him about man , for he knew what was in man .
43003001	THERE was a man of the Pharisees , Nicodemus by name , a ruler of the Jews .
43003002	This man came to Jesus one night and said to him , " Rabbi , we know that you have come from God as a teacher ; for no one can do these signs that you are doing unless God is with him . "
43003003	Jesus answered , " Truly , truly , I tell you , unless a man is born from above he cannot see the kingdom of God . "
43003004	Nicodemus said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter into his mother's womb a second time and be born ? "
43003005	Jesus answered , " Truly , truly , I tell you , unless a man is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
43003006	What is born of the flesh is flesh , and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Do not wonder that I said , ' You must be born from above . '
43003008	The wind blows where it will , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes . So is every one who is born of the Spirit . "
43003009	Nicodemus answered him , " How can these things be ? "
43003010	Jesus answered him , " You are the teacher of Israel , and do you not know these things ?
43003011	Truly , truly , I tell you , we are speaking of what we know , and we are witnessing to what we have seen , and you do not accept our testimony .
43003012	If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven — the Son of Man .
43003014	As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert , so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
43003015	that every one who believes in him may have life eternal . "
43003016	For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that every one who believes in him may not perish , but have life eternal .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world might be saved through him .
43003018	He who believes in him is not condemned . He who does not believe has been already condemned , because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God .
43003019	This is the condemnation , that Light has come into the world and men have loved darkness rather than Light , because their deeds were wicked .
43003020	Every one who is doing base things hates the Light and does not come to the Light , that his deeds may not be reproved .
43003021	But he who is doing the truth comes to the Light , that it may be plainly shown that his deeds have been done in union with God .
43003022	After this Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea and there he spent some time with them and baptized .
43003023	John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim , because there was abundant water there . People were constantly coming and being baptized .
43003024	For John had not yet been thrown into prison .
43003025	There arose a dispute between the disciples of John and a Jew about purification .
43003026	They came to John and said to him , " Rabbi , the man who was with you across the Jordan to whom you bore testimony — see , he is baptizing and all are coming to him . "
43003027	John answered , " A man can assume nothing unless it has been given him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves are witnesses that I said , ' I am not the Christ , but I have been sent before him . '
43003029	He who has the bride is the bridegroom . But the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice . So this joy of mine is complete .
43003030	He must increase , but I must decrease . "
43003031	He who comes from above is above all . He who is of the earth is of the earth and he speaks of the earth . He who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	What he has seen and heard , that he testifies to , yet no one accepts his testimony .
43003033	He who accepts his testimony has set his seal that God is true .
43003034	He whom God has sent speaks the word of God , for he does not give him the Spirit by measure .
43003035	The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hand .
43003036	He who believes in the Son has life eternal . He who disbelieves in the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God abides upon him .
43004001	WHEN the Master knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John —
43004002	though Jesus himself was not baptizing , but his disciples —
43004003	he left Judaea and went back again to Galilee .
43004004	He had to pass through Samaria .
43004005	He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar , near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob's well was there . Jesus , weary from his journey , sat just as he was on the well . It was about noon .
43004007	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water . Jesus said to her , " Give me a drink . "
43004008	For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food .
43004009	The Samaritan woman said to him , " How do you , a Jew , ask a drink from me , a Samaritan woman ? " For Jews do not associate with Samaritans .
43004010	Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you , ' Give me a drink , ' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water . "
43004011	She said to him , " Sir , you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep . Where do you get the living water from ?
43004012	Are you greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well and drank of it , himself and his sons and his flocks ? "
43004013	Jesus answered her , " Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again .
43004014	But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst , but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water , flowing out into life eternal . "
43004015	The woman said to him , " Give me this water , so that I may not thirst nor come all the way here to draw . "
43004016	He said to her , " Go call your husband and come back here . "
43004017	The woman answered , " I have no husband . " Jesus said to her , " You say rightly that you have no husband .
43004018	Five husbands you have had , and now the man you have is not your husband . You have told the truth about that . "
43004019	The woman said to him , " Sir , I perceive that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , but you say that in Jerusalem is the proper place to worship . "
43004021	Jesus said to her , " Believe me , woman , the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father .
43004022	You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we know , for salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But the hour is coming — yes , is now here — when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth . For the Father seeks for such worshipers .
43004024	God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth . "
43004025	The woman said to him , " I know that Messiah is coming , who is called Christ . When he comes he will tell us all things . "
43004026	Jesus said to her , " I am he , I who am talking to you . "
43004027	Upon this came his disciples , and they wondered that he was talking with a woman . But no one said , " What do you want ? " or , " Why are you talking with her ? "
43004028	The woman left her pitcher and went away into the city and said to the people ,
43004029	" Come , see a man who has told me all that I ever did . Is not this the Christ ? "
43004030	They came out of the city and were on the way to him .
43004031	In the meantime his disciples begged him , " Rabbi , eat something . "
43004032	He said to them , " I have food to eat that you do not know of . "
43004033	The disciples said to one another , " Can it be that any one has brought him something to eat ? "
43004034	Jesus said to them , " My food is to do the will of him who sent me , and to complete his work .
43004035	Do you not say that there are still four months and then comes harvest ? Why , lift up your eyes , I tell you , and look on the fields , for they are white for harvest !
43004036	Already the reaper is gaining wages and is gathering a harvest for life eternal , that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together .
43004037	Here the saying is true , that ' One is sower and another is reaper . '
43004038	I have sent you to reap what you have not labored for . Others have labored and you have entered into their labor . "
43004039	From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him on account of the woman's testimony , " He told me all that I ever did . "
43004040	When the Samaritans came out to him , they begged him to stay with them , and he stayed there two days .
43004041	Many more believed on account of his own words ,
43004042	and they said to the woman , " We no longer believe because of what you said , for we ourselves have heard him and we know that this is truly the Savior of the World . "
43004043	After the two days he went from there into Galilee .
43004044	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place .
43004045	So when he came into Galilee , the Galilaeans welcomed him because they had seen what he did in Jerusalem at the feast . For they , too , had gone to the feast .
43004046	He came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine . A certain royal officer was there whose son was sick in Capernaum .
43004047	This man heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee , and he came to him and begged him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death ,
43004048	Jesus said to him , " Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe . "
43004049	The officer said to him , " Sir , come down before my child dies . "
43004050	Jesus said to him , " Go . Your son is living . " The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and went .
43004051	Even while he was going down , his servants met him with the word that his son was living .
43004052	He inquired of them the hour when he was better . They said to him , " Yesterday at one o'clock the fever left him . "
43004053	So the father knew that it was at that hour at which Jesus had said to him , " Your son is living , " and he believed , himself and his whole household .
43004054	This is the second time that Jesus did a sign just after coming from Judaea to Galilee .
43005001	AFTER this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	There is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool which is called in Hebrew Bethesda . Around it are five colonnades .
43005003	In these lay a multitude of invalids — blind , lame , withered .
43005005	There was a man there who had had an infirmity thirty-eight years .
43005006	Jesus saw this man lying there and perceiving that he had been there a long time , he said to him , " Do you want to get well ? "
43005007	The sick man answered him , " I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled . While I am coming , some other man gets down before me . "
43005008	Jesus said to him , " Rise , take up your pallet and walk . "
43005009	At once the man became well and took up his pallet and began walking . That day was the Sabbath .
43005010	The Jews said to the man who had been cured , " It is the Sabbath , and it is not proper for you to carry your pallet . "
43005011	But he answered them , " He who made me well — he told me , ' Take up your pallet and walk . '
43005012	They asked him , " Who is the man that told you , ' Take it up and walk ' ? "
43005013	The cured man did not know who it was . For Jesus had taken himself away , a crowd being in that place .
43005014	Afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple court and said to him , " See , you have become well . Sin no more , for something worse might happen to you . "
43005015	The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the man who had made him well .
43005016	On this account the Jews persecuted Jesus because he did such things on the Sabbath .
43005017	He answered them , " My Father has been working until now , and I am working . "
43005018	On this account the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only kept breaking the Sabbath , but even spoke of God as his own Father , making himself equal with God .
43005019	Jesus said to them , " Truly , truly , I tell you , the Son can do nothing of himself ; he does only what he sees the Father doing ; whatever things he does , those the Son does likewise .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son and shows him what he is doing , and he will show him greater works than these that you may wonder .
43005021	For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so also the Son gives life to whom he will .
43005022	Neither does the Father judge any one , but he has committed all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father . He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	Truly , truly , I tell you , he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has life eternal and does not come into condemnation , but has passed over from death into life .
43005025	Truly , truly , I tell you that the hour is coming , and is now here , when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear will live .
43005026	For as the Father has life in himself , so also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself .
43005027	He has given him authority to do judgment , because he is Son of Man .
43005028	Do not wonder at this , because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
43005029	and will come forth — those who have done good to a resurrection of life and those who have done evil to a resurrection of condemnation .
43005030	" I cannot of myself do anything . As I hear I judge and my judgment is just , because I do not seek my own will , but the will of him who sent me .
43005031	If I testify regarding myself , my testimony is not true .
43005032	There is another who testifies regarding me and I know that the testimony that he bears regarding me is true .
43005033	You sent to John and he testified to the truth ,
43005034	still I do not obtain my testimony from a man , but I say this that you may be saved .
43005035	He was the burning and shining light and you were willing to rejoice for an hour in his light .
43005036	But I have testimony greater than John's . For the works which the Father has granted to me to accomplish — the very works that I do — witness for me that the Father has sent me .
43005037	The Father who sent me — he has witnessed regarding me . You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form ,
43005038	and you have not his word abiding in you ; because you do not believe him whom he has sent .
43005039	You search the Scriptures because you think that you have in them life eternal , and it is they that testify of me ,
43005040	and yet you will not come to me to have life .
43005041	I do not accept honor from men ,
43005042	but I know that you have not the love of God within you .
43005043	I have come in the name of my Father and you do not accept me . If another comes in his own name , you will accept him .
43005044	How can you believe , you who accept honor from one another and do not seek honor from the only God ?
43005045	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father . You have an accuser , Moses in whom you trust .
43005046	If you believed Moses , you would believe me , for he wrote about me .
43005047	But if you do not believe his writings , how will you believe my words ? "
43006001	AFTER this Jesus went away beyond the Lake of Galilee .
43006002	A great crowd was following him because they saw the signs that he was doing upon those who had infirmities .
43006003	Jesus had gone up on the mountain and there he was sitting with his disciples .
43006004	It was near the time for the Passover , the feast of the Jews .
43006005	He lifted up his eyes and saw that a great crowd was coming to him , and he said to Philip , " Where shall we buy bread for these to eat ? "
43006006	This he said to test him , for he himself knew what he was going to do .
43006007	Philip answered him , " Two hundred shillings worth of bread would not be enough for them each to have a little piece . "
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , said to him ,
43006009	" There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fishes . But what are these for so many ? "
43006010	Jesus said , " Make the people recline on the ground . " There was much grass in the place . So the men , about five thousand in number , reclined on the ground .
43006011	Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks and divided them to those who were reclining , and in the same way the fishes , as much as they wanted .
43006012	When they were satisfied , he said to his disciples , " Gather up the broken pieces that have been left over , so that nothing may be wasted . "
43006013	They gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
43006014	Then the people , seeing the sign that he had done , said , " This is truly the prophet who was to come into the world ! "
43006015	Jesus , perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king , withdrew again up the mountain by himself alone .
43006016	When evening came , his disciples went down to the lake
43006017	and got into a boat and started across toward Capernaum . It had already grown dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
43006018	The lake was getting rough , as a strong wind was blowing .
43006019	When they had rowed three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the lake and getting near the boat , and they were frightened .
43006020	But he said to them , " It is I ; never fear . "
43006021	Then they were willing to take him into the boat , and at once the boat came to the land they were making for .
43006022	On the next day the crowd that was standing on the other side of the lake saw that there had been no boat there but the one , and that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples , but that his disciples had gone away by themselves
43006023	
43006024	when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there nor his disciples either , they got into those boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
43006025	When they found him across the lake , they said to him , " Rabbi , when did you get here ? "
43006026	Jesus answered them , " Truly , truly , I tell you , you are looking for me not because you saw signs , but because you ate of the loaves and had your fill .
43006027	Do not work for the food that perishes , but for the food that endures to life eternal , which the Son of Man will give you . For him God the Father has sealed . "
43006028	They said to him , " What are we to do to work the works of God ? "
43006029	Jesus answered them , " This is the work of God , to believe in him whom he has sent . "
43006030	They said to him , " What sign are you doing for us to see and believe in you ? What are you working ?
43006031	Our fathers ate the manna in the desert as it is written , ' He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ' "
43006032	Jesus said to them , " Truly , truly , I tell you Moses did not give you the bread from heaven , but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is he who came down from heaven and gives his life for the world . "
43006034	They said to him , " Sir , always give us this bread . "
43006035	Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life . He who comes to me will never hunger , and he who believes in me will never thirst .
43006036	But , I tell you , you have seen me and do not believe .
43006037	All that the Father gives me will come to me , and him who comes to me I will not cast away ;
43006038	for I came down from heaven not to do my will , but the will of him who sent me ;
43006039	and this is the will of him who sent me , that of the whole that he has given me I should lose nothing , but should raise all up on the last day .
43006040	For this is the will of my Father , that every one who looks upon the Son and believes in him shall have life eternal , and I will raise him up on the last day . "
43006041	The Jews were muttering to each other about him because he said , " I am the bread that came down from heaven , "
43006042	and they were saying , " Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How does he say now , ' I have come down from heaven ' ? "
43006043	Jesus answered them , " Do not be muttering with one another .
43006044	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him . And I will raise him up on the last day .
43006045	It is written in the prophets , ' They will all be taught by God . ' Every one who has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me .
43006046	Not that any one has seen the Father but he who is from God — he has seen the Father .
43006047	Truly , truly , I tell you , he who believes has life eternal .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your fathers ate the manna in the desert and they died .
43006050	This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that any one may eat of it and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread that comes down from heaven . If any one eats of this bread , he will live forever . And the bread that I will give is my flesh : I will give it for the life of the world . "
43006052	The Jews disputed angrily with one another , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
43006053	Jesus said to them , " Truly , truly , I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you .
43006054	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal , and I will raise him up on the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink .
43006056	He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I abide in him .
43006057	As the living Father sent me and I am living because of the Father , so he who eats me — he will live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread that came down from heaven , not such as your fathers ate and died . He who eats this bread will live forever . "
43006059	These things he said while teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	Many of his disciples , after hearing him , said , " This is a hard doctrine . Who can listen to it ? "
43006061	Jesus , knowing in his own mind that his disciples were muttering about this , said to them , " Does this make you stumble ?
43006062	What if you behold the Son of Man ascending where he was before ?
43006063	The spirit is what gives life ; the flesh is of no account . The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life .
43006064	But there are some of you who do not believe . " For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe , and who it was that would betray him .
43006065	He said , " For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him from the Father . "
43006066	After that many of the disciples drew back from him and no longer went about with him .
43006067	Jesus said to the twelve , " Will you also go away ? "
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , " Sir , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of life eternal ,
43006069	and we are persuaded and know that you are the Holy One of God . "
43006070	Jesus answered them , " Did I not choose you twelve ? Yet one of you is a devil ! "
43006071	He was speaking of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . For he was going to betray him , though he was one of the twelve .
43007001	AFTER this Jesus went about in Galilee ; for he would not go about in Judaea because the Jews were trying to kill him .
43007002	The Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near .
43007003	His brothers said to him , " Leave this region and go into Judaea so that your disciples may see the works that you are doing .
43007004	For no one does anything in secret while desiring to be known publicly . If you are doing these things , show yourself to the world . "
43007005	For neither did his brothers believe in him .
43007006	Jesus said to them , " My time has not yet come . Any time suits you .
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates me , because I testify about it that its ways are wicked .
43007008	Go on up to the feast yourselves ; I am not going up yet to this feast , for my time has not fully come . "
43007009	After saying this to them he stayed in Galilee .
43007010	After his brothers had gone up to the feast , Jesus himself went up , not openly , but somewhat privately .
43007011	The Jews were looking for him at the feast and were saying , " Where is that man ? "
43007012	A low murmur of debate about him ran through the crowds . Some were saying , " He is good . " Others were saying , " No , he misleads the crowd . "
43007013	Nobody , however , was talking openly about him for fear of the Jews .
43007014	About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the Temple courts and began teaching .
43007015	The Jews were astonished and said , " How does this man know books when he has never been educated ? "
43007017	Jesus answered them , " If any one wills to do his will , he will know about the teaching , whether it is from God or I am speaking out of my own mind .
43007018	One who speaks out of his own mind is seeking his own glory . He who seeks the glory of him who sent him — he is true , and wickedness is not in him .
43007019	Did not Moses give you the Law ? Yet no one of you keeps the Law . Why are you trying to kill me ? "
43007020	The crowd answered , " You have a demon . Who is trying to kill you ? "
43007021	Jesus answered them , " I did one good work and you all wonder about it .
43007022	Moses gave you circumcision — not that it is from Moses , but from our fathers — and on the Sabbath you circumcise a person .
43007023	If a person receives circumcision on the Sabbath , so that the Law of Moses may not be broken , are you bitter against me because I have made a man well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Do not judge by appearances , but judge fair judgment . "
43007025	Some of the Jerusalem people were saying , " Is not this the man they are trying to kill ?
43007026	See , he is talking freely and they say nothing to him . It cannot be that the rulers know for truth that this is the Christ ?
43007027	But we know where this man comes from . The Christ , when he comes — no one will know where he comes from . "
43007028	Jesus , while teaching in the Temple courts , cried out loudly , " You know me and you know where I come from . I have not come of myself , but he is true who sent me . You do not know him ,
43007029	but I know him , for I am from him and he sent me . "
43007030	They tried to arrest him , but no one laid a hand on him , for his hour had not yet come .
43007031	From the crowd many believed in him and said , " The Christ , when he comes , will not do more signs than this man does , will he ? "
43007032	The Pharisees heard the murmur of debate about him in the crowd , and the high priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
43007033	Jesus said , " A little while longer I am with you and then I am going to him who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me and will not find me , and where I am you cannot come . "
43007035	The Jews said to one another , " Where is this man going that we shall not find him ? Will he go to the Jews who are scattered among the Greeks and teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What does this assertion mean , ' You will look for me and will not find me , and where I am you cannot come ' ? "
43007037	On the last day , the great day , of the feast Jesus stood and cried out , " If any man thirsts , let him come to me and drink .
43007038	He who believes in me , as the Scripture has said , rivers of living water will flow from within him . "
43007039	This he said referring to the Spirit which those who had believed in him were soon to receive . For as yet there was no Spirit , because Jesus had not yet been glorified .
43007040	Some from the crowd , on hearing these words , said , " This man is truly the prophet . "
43007041	Others said , " This is the Christ . " Others said , " The Christ is not coming out of Galilee , is he ?
43007042	Does not the Scripture say that the Christ comes of the descendants of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? "
43007043	A division arose in the crowd over him .
43007044	Some of them wanted to arrest him , but no one laid hands on him .
43007045	The officers came to the high priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , " Why did you not bring him ? "
43007046	The officers answered , " Never any man spoke as this man speaks . "
43007047	The Pharisees answered them , " Have you also been deluded ?
43007048	Can it be that any one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in him ?
43007049	But this crowd who do not know the Law are cursed . "
43007050	Nicodemus said to them — he who came to Jesus before — being himself one of them ,
43007051	" Does our Law condemn any man without first hearing from him and learning what he is doing ? "
43007052	They answered him , " Can it be that you too are from Galilee ? Examine and see that from Galilee no prophet arises . "
43007053	[ They went each to his home ,
43008001	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	EARLY in the morning he came again to the Temple courts and all the people came to him and he sat down and taught them .
43008003	The scribes and the Pharisees led in a woman taken in adultery and making her stand in the midst ,
43008004	they said to him , " Teacher , this woman was taken in the very act of adultery .
43008005	In the Law Moses commanded to stone such . What do you say ? "
43008006	This they said , testing him , to have something to accuse him of . But Jesus stooped over and wrote with his finger on the ground .
43008007	As they kept on questioning him , he lifted himself up and said to them , " Let the sinless one among you be the first to throw a stone at her , "
43008008	and again he stooped over and went on writing on the ground .
43008009	After hearing that , they passed out one by one , beginning with the older men , and he was left alone and the woman there in the center .
43008010	Jesus raised himself up and said to her , " Woman , where are they ? Has no one sentenced you ? "
43008011	She said , " No one , Sir . " Jesus said , " Neither do I sentence you . Go . From now on sin no more . " ]
43008012	Again Jesus spoke to them , saying , " I am the light of the world . He who follows me will not walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . "
43008013	The Pharisees said to him , " You are bearing witness to yourself ; your witness is not true . "
43008014	Jesus answered them , " Even if I witness to myself , my witness is true , for I know where I came from and where I am going . You do not know where I came from or where I am going .
43008015	You judge according to the flesh , I judge no one .
43008016	Even if I judge , my judgment is true , for I am not alone , but when I judge he who sent me is with me .
43008017	In our law it is written that the evidence of two persons is true .
43008018	I am giving witness to myself and the Father who sent me witnesses to me . "
43008019	They said to him , " Where is your Father ? " Jesus answered , " You know neither me nor my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father also . "
43008020	These words he spoke in the Treasury , while teaching in the Temple courts , and no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come .
43008021	He said again to them , " I am going away and you will search for me and will die in your sin . Where I am going you cannot come . "
43008022	The Jews said , " Will he kill himself , and so says , ' Where I am going you cannot come ' ? "
43008023	He said to them , " You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ; I am not of this world .
43008024	Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins . Unless you believe that I am he , you will die in your sins . "
43008025	They said to him , " Who are you ? " Jesus said to them , " Exactly what I have been telling you .
43008026	I have many things to say about you and to judge . But he who sent me is true , and what I have heard from him I speak in the world . "
43008027	They did not perceive that he was speaking to them of the Father .
43008028	Jesus said , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and that of myself I do nothing , but as the Father taught me , so I speak .
43008029	He who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , because I always do what is pleasing to him . "
43008030	While he was speaking these things , many believed in him .
43008031	Jesus said to the Jews that had believed him , " If you continue in my word , you are truly my disciples ,
43008032	and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free . "
43008033	They answered him , " We are descendants of Abraham and have never been in slavery to any man . How do you say , ' You will become free ' ? "
43008034	Jesus answered them , " Truly , truly , I tell you , every one who practices sin is the slave of sin .
43008035	The slave does not stay in the house forever ; the Son stays forever .
43008036	So if the Son frees you , you will be really free .
43008037	I know that you are descendants of Abraham ; but you are trying to kill me , because my word has no place within you .
43008038	I am speaking what I have seen with my Father and you are doing what you have heard with your father . "
43008039	They answered him , " Abraham is our father . " He said to them , " If you were children of Abraham you would do the works of Abraham .
43008040	But now you are trying to kill me , a man who has spoken to you the truth which I have heard from God . Abraham did not do this .
43008041	You do the works of your father . " They said to him , " We were not born of unchastity . We have one father — God . "
43008042	Jesus said to them , " If God were your father you would love me ; for I came forth from God and am now here . For I have not come of myself , but he sent me .
43008043	Why do you not understand what I am saying ? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message .
43008044	You are of your father the Devil , and the lusts of your father it is your will to practice . He was a murderer from the beginning , and did not stand in the truth ; for truth is not in him . When he speaks falsehood , he speaks out of his own ; for he is a liar and the father of it .
43008045	But me — because I tell you the truth — me you do not believe .
43008046	Who of you convinces me of sin ? If I speak truth , why do you not believe me ?
43008047	He who is of God listens to God's words . For this reason you do not listen — because you are not of God . "
43008048	The Jews answered him , " Do we not say correctly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon ? "
43008049	Jesus answered , " I have not a demon , but I honor my Father and you dishonor me .
43008050	I am not seeking my own glory . There is one who seeks it and judges .
43008051	Truly , truly , I tell you , if any one keeps my word he will not look on death . "
43008052	The Jews said to him , " Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham died and the prophets died , and you say , ' If any one keeps my word he will never taste of death . '
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? And yet he died and the prophets died . Whom do you make yourself out to be ? "
43008054	Jesus answered , " If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . It is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say that he is your God .
43008055	Yet you do not know him , but I know him , and if I should say that I did not know him I should be a liar like you . But I know him and I keep his word .
43008056	Abraham your father rejoiced that he was to see my day , and he saw it and was glad . "
43008057	The Jews said to him , " You are not yet fifty years old , and have you seen Abraham ?
43008058	Jesus said to them , " Truly , truly , I tell you , before Abraham came into being I am . "
43008059	They took up stones to throw at him ; but Jesus concealed himself and left the Temple courts .
43009001	AS he was passing by , Jesus saw a man who had been blind from birth .
43009002	His disciples asked him , " Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? "
43009003	Jesus answered , " Neither this man sinned nor his parents ; but it was in order that the works of God might be manifested in him .
43009004	We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day . Night is coming when no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world I am the light of the world . "
43009006	After saying this , he spit on the ground and made clay with the spittle and put the clay on the man's eyes
43009007	and said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Siloam . " He went away and washed and came back seeing .
43009008	His neighbors and those accustomed to see him before , when he was begging , said , " Is not this the man that sat and begged ? "
43009009	Some said , " This is he . " Others said , " No , but he is like him . " He said , " I am the man . "
43009010	They said to him , " How then were your eyes opened ? "
43009011	He replied , " The man called Jesus made clay and spread it on my eyes and said to me , ' Go to Siloam and wash . ' I went and washed and received my sight . "
43009012	They said to him , " Where is that man ? " He said , " I do not know . "
43009013	They brought him to the Pharisees — the man once blind .
43009014	It was on the Sabbath day that Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes .
43009015	The Pharisees in their turn asked him how he received his sight . He said to them , " He put clay on my eyes and I washed and I saw . "
43009016	Some of the Pharisees said , " This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath . " Others said , " How can a man , if he is a sinner , do such signs ? " So there was a division among them .
43009017	They said again to the blind man , " What do you say about him , now that he has opened your eyes ? " He said , " He is a prophet . "
43009018	The Jews did not believe the story that he was blind and recovered his sight , until they had called the parents of the man who had recovered his sight
43009019	and had asked them , " Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? Then how can he see now ? "
43009020	His parents answered , " We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind .
43009021	But how he sees now we do not know , or who opened his eyes we do not know . Ask him ; he is of age ; he shall speak for himself . "
43009022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews . For the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed Jesus as the Christ , he should be cast out of the synagogue .
43009023	For this reason his parents said , " He is of age , ask him . "
43009024	They called a second time the man who had been blind , and said to him , " Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner . "
43009025	The man answered , " Whether he is a sinner I do not know . One thing I know , I was blind and now I see . "
43009026	They said to him , " What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? "
43009027	He answered them , " I have told you already and you did not listen , why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples ? "
43009028	They flouted him and said , " You are that man's disciple ; we are Moses ' disciples .
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses , but this man — we do not know where he comes from . "
43009030	The man answered them , " There is something wonderful in this . You do not know where he comes from , yet he has opened my eyes !
43009031	We know that God does not listen to a sinner , but if any one is God-fearing and does his will , God hears him .
43009032	Since the world began it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind .
43009033	If this man were not from God , he could not do anything . "
43009034	They answered him , " You were born in sin — wholly ; and are you teaching us ? " and they cast him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had cast him out , and found him and said , " Do you believe in the Son of Man ? "
43009036	The man answered , " Who is he , Sir ? Tell me , so that I may believe in him . "
43009037	Jesus said to him , " You have seen him , and it is he who is talking with you . "
43009038	He said , " I believe , Sir , " and bowed down before him .
43009039	Jesus said , " For judgment I came into this world , that those who do not see may see , and that those who see may become blind . "
43009040	Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and said to him , " Are we blind also ? "
43009041	Jesus said to them , " If you were blind , you would have no sin . But now that you say , ' We see , ' your sin remains with you . "
43010001	" TRULY , truly , I tell you , he who does not enter through the gate into the sheepfold , but climbs over somewhere else , that man is a thief and a robber .
43010002	But he who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The gate-keeper opens to him and the sheep listen to his voice , and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	When he has brought out all his own sheep , he goes before them and the sheep follow him , for they know his voice .
43010005	They will not follow a stranger , but will run away from him , for they do not know the voices of strangers . "
43010006	This illustration Jesus gave to them , but they did not understand what he was saying to them .
43010007	Again Jesus spoke : " Truly , truly , I tell you , I am the gate of the sheep .
43010008	All that ever came before me were thieves and robbers . But the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the gate : if any one enters through me he will be saved , and will go in and go out and find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy . I have come that they may have life and have it abundantly .
43010011	I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
43010012	The hireling , who is not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , looks on as the wolf comes and leaves the sheep and runs away — and the wolf seizes them and scatters them —
43010013	because he is a hireling and does not care for the sheep .
43010014	I am the good shepherd , and I know mine and mine know me ,
43010015	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father , and I lay down my life for the sheep .
43010016	But I have other sheep which are not of this fold ; I must bring them also , and they will listen to my voice , and there will be one flock , one shepherd .
43010017	For this the Father loves me , because I lay down my life to take it again .
43010018	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down and have power to take it again . This command I received from my Father . "
43010019	There was again a division among the Jews , on account of these words .
43010020	Many of them said , " He has a demon and is insane . Why do you listen to him ? "
43010021	Others said , " These words are not those of a demoniac . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? "
43010022	Then came the Feast of Renovation in Jerusalem . It was winter .
43010023	Jesus was walking in the Temple courts , in Solomon's Colonnade .
43010024	The Jews came in a circle around him and said to him , " How long are you going to keep us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us frankly . "
43010025	Jesus answered them , " I have told you and you do not believe . The works that I do in my Father's name — these witness for me .
43010026	But you do not believe because you are not of my sheep .
43010027	My sheep listen to my voice and I know them and they follow me ,
43010028	and I give to them life eternal , and they will never perish , and no one will snatch them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father who gave them to me is greater than all , and no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand .
43010030	I and my Father are one . "
43010031	Again the Jews took up stones to stone him .
43010032	Jesus answered them , " Many good works I have shown you from my Father . For which of these works are you stoning me ? "
43010033	The Jews answered him , " For a good work we are not stoning you , but for profane words , because you , a man , are making yourself God . "
43010034	Jesus answered them , " Is it not written in your Law , ' I said you are Gods ' ?
43010035	If he called those to whom the word of God came Gods — and the authority of Scripture cannot be denied —
43010036	do you say to him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world , ' You speak profane words , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ' ?
43010037	if I do not do the works of my Father , do not believe me .
43010038	But if I do , even though you do not believe me , believe the works ; that you may perceive and know that the Father is in me and that I am in the Father . "
43010039	Again they tried to seize him , but he escaped from their hands
43010040	and went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was at first when he was baptizing , and he stayed there .
43010041	Many came to him and they said , " John did no sign ; but all that John said about this man was true . "
43010042	Many believed in him there .
43011001	THERE was a certain man sick — Lazarus of Bethany , of the village of Mary and Martha her sister .
43011002	It was that Mary who anointed the Master with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick .
43011003	So the sisters sent to Jesus , saying , " Master , he whom you love is sick . "
43011004	When Jesus heard it he said , " This sickness is not to end in death , but is for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified by it . "
43011005	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	So when he heard that he was sick , he stayed where he was two days .
43011007	Then , after that , he said to the disciples , " Let us go to Judaea again . "
43011008	The disciples said to him , " Rabbi , just now the Jews were trying to stone you , and are you going there again ? "
43011009	Jesus answered , " Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any one walks in the day , he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	But if any one walks in the night , he stumbles because the light is not in him . "
43011011	He said this , and then he said to them , " Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep , but I am going there to wake him . "
43011012	The disciples said to him , " Master , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover . "
43011013	But Jesus had spoken of his death . They thought that he was speaking of the repose of sleep .
43011014	Then Jesus said to them frankly , " Lazarus has died ,
43011015	and I am glad on your account that I was not there — so that you may believe . But let us go to him . "
43011016	Thomas , who is called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples , " Let us go too to die with him . "
43011017	When Jesus came he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb .
43011018	Bethany was near Jerusalem , about two miles away ,
43011019	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them regarding their brother .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him . Mary was sitting in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , " Master , if you had been here my brother would not have died .
43011022	And now I know that whatever you ask God for , God will give you . "
43011023	Jesus said to her , " Your brother will rise again . "
43011024	Martha said to him , " I know that he will rise at the resurrection on the last day . "
43011025	Jesus said to her , " I am the Resurrection and the Life . He who believes in me even though he dies will live ,
43011026	and no one who lives and believes in me will ever die . Do you believe this ? "
43011027	She said to him , " Yes , Master . I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , who was to come into the world . "
43011028	Having said this , she went away and called Mary her sister , saying to her privately , " The Teacher is here and is asking for you . "
43011029	She , when she heard it , rose quickly and went to meet him .
43011030	Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha had met him .
43011031	The Jews who were with Mary in the house trying to comfort her , seeing her rise quickly and go out , followed thinking that she was going to the tomb to wail there .
43011032	When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet , saying , " Master , if you had been here my brother would not have died . "
43011033	When Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who had come with her weeping , he was indignant in spirit and disturbed ,
43011034	and said , " Where have you laid him ? " They said to him , " Master , come and see . "
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	The Jews said , " See , how he loved him ! "
43011037	Some of them said , " Could not this man , who opened the eyes of the blind , have prevented this man from dying ? "
43011038	Jesus , again indignant , came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone was lying on the entrance .
43011039	Jesus said , " Take away the stone . " Martha , the sister of the dead man , said to him , " Master , he is already offensive , for he has been dead four days . "
43011040	Jesus said to her , " Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God ? "
43011041	So they took away the stone . Jesus lifted up his eyes and said , " Father , I thank thee for hearing me .
43011042	I know that thou always hearest me ; but for the sake of the crowd that stand around I say it , that they may believe that thou didst send me . "
43011043	After saying this he called in a loud voice , " Lazarus , come forth . "
43011044	Forth came the dead man , swathed feet and hands in grave-clothes and his face bound up in a handkerchief . Jesus said , " Loose him and let him go . "
43011045	Many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him .
43011046	But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said , " What are we doing ? for this man is doing many signs .
43011048	If we let him alone in this way , all will believe in him and the Romans will come and destroy our place and nation . "
43011049	One of them , Caiaphas , who was High Priest that year , said to them , " You do not know anything
43011050	nor do you reason that it is better for you that one man should die for the people and so the whole nation escape destruction . "
43011051	He did not say this of himself , but being High Priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation ,
43011052	and not for the nation only , but to gather into one the children of God now scattered far and wide .
43011053	From that day they plotted to kill him .
43011054	So Jesus no more walked about openly among the Jews , but went away from there into the country near the wild lands , to a city called Ephraim , and there he stayed with his disciples .
43011055	The Passover of the Jews was near and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves .
43011056	They were looking for Jesus and were saying to one another , as they stood in the Temple courts , " What do you think ? That he will not come to the feast ? "
43011057	The high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that , if any one knew where he was , he should report it so that they might arrest him .
43012001	SIX days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was whom he had raised from the dead .
43012002	There they made a dinner for him . Martha waited on them , and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him .
43012003	Mary took a pound of pure nard perfume , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair . The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43012004	Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples , the one who was going to betray him , said ,
43012005	" Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor ? "
43012006	He said this , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief and having the purse used to pilfer what was put into it .
43012007	Jesus said , " Let her alone . It was hers to keep for the day of my preparation for the tomb .
43012008	The poor you always have with you , but me you have not .
43012009	A great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not on account of Jesus alone , but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	The high priests planned to kill Lazarus too ,
43012011	because many of the Jews on account of him went and believed in Jesus .
43012012	On the next day the great crowd which had come to the feast , hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
43012013	took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him , shouting , " God save him ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord — the King of Israel ! "
43012014	Jesus , finding a young ass , sat on it , as it is written ,
43012015	" Fear not , daughter of Zion ! Behold , your King comes , sitting on the foal of an ass ! "
43012016	These things his disciples did not understand at first , but when Jesus had been glorified , then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him .
43012017	The people that were with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead were bearing witness to it .
43012018	For this reason the crowd went to meet him , because they had heard that he had done this sign .
43012019	The Pharisees said among themselves , " You see that you are gaining nothing . Look , the world has gone off after him . "
43012020	There were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast .
43012021	These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee , and asked him , " Sir , we wish to see Jesus . "
43012022	Philip came and told Andrew . Andrew came with Philip and they told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus answered them , " The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
43012024	Truly , truly , I tell you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies , it remains alone . But if it dies it bears much fruit .
43012025	He who loves his life destroys it , and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for life eternal .
43012026	If any one is serving me , let him follow me and where I am there my servant shall be . If any one is serving me , him my Father will honor .
43012027	Now my soul is troubled , and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour ? But for this I have come to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify thy name ! " There came a voice from heaven , " I have glorified it and will again glorify it . "
43012029	The crowd that was standing there and heard said that it had thundered . Others said , " An angel spoke to him . "
43012030	Jesus said , " This voice came , not on my account , but for you .
43012031	Now is the judgment of this world . Now the Ruler of this world will be cast out .
43012032	And I , if I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all men to me . "
43012033	This he said indicating by what death he was to die .
43012034	The crowd answered him , " We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever . How do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? "
43012035	Jesus said to them , " A little while longer the Light is among you . Walk while you have the Light , that darkness may not overtake you . He who walks in darkness does not know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the Light , believe in the Light , so as to become sons of Light . " Jesus said these things and then went away and hid himself from them .
43012037	But , though he had done so many signs before them , they did not believe in him ,
43012038	so that the word of Isaiah the prophet should be fulfilled . Isaiah said , " Lord , who has believed our report , and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? "
43012039	For this reason they could not believe , because Isaiah said again ,
43012040	" He has blinded their eyes and dulled their mind so that they may not see with their eyes nor understand with their mind and repent so that I should heal them . "
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and he spoke of him .
43012042	Nevertheless , even of the rulers many did believe in him , but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it , in order not to be expelled from the synagogue ;
43012043	for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
43012044	Jesus cried out , " He who believes in me does not believe in me , but in him who sent me ,
43012045	and he who looks upon me looks upon him who sent me .
43012046	I have come as a Light into the world that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness .
43012047	If any one hears my words and does not keep them , I do not judge him ; for I have not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
43012048	He who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge . The message that I have spoken — that will judge him on the last day .
43012049	But he who sent me — the Father himself — has given me a command what I am to say and what I am to speak ,
43012050	and I know that his command is life eternal . So what I am speaking I am speaking just as the Father has told me . "
43013001	BEFORE the Feast of the Passover , Jesus , knowing that the hour had come for him to pass from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world loved them to the end .
43013002	During supper , the Devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to betray him ,
43013003	Jesus , knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going to God ,
43013004	rose from supper and laid aside his upper garments and took a towel and put it around him .
43013005	Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel he had around him .
43013006	He came to Simon Peter . Peter said to him , " Master , are you washing my feet ? "
43013007	Jesus answered him , " What I am doing you do not know now ; but you will know hereafter . "
43013008	Peter said to him , " You shall never wash my feet ! " Jesus answered him , " Unless I wash you , you have no part with me . "
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , " Master , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head . "
43013010	Jesus said to him , " He who has bathed has no need to be washed , except his feet , but is all clean . And you are clean , though not all . "
43013011	For he knew the one who was going to betray him . For this reason he said , " You are not all clean . "
43013012	When he had washed their feet and had taken his upper garments and lain down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
43013013	You call me Teacher and Master and you say rightly , for so I am .
43013014	If then I , the Master and Teacher , have washed your feet , you too ought to wash one another's feet .
43013015	For I have given you an example that you may do as I have done to you .
43013016	Truly , truly , I tell you , the servant is not superior to his master nor the messenger superior to him who sent him .
43013017	If you know these things , blessed are you — if you do them .
43013018	I am not speaking of all of you . I know whom I have chosen . But that the Scripture may be fulfilled , ' He who is eating my bread has lifted up his heel against me . '
43013019	I am now telling you before it occurs that when it does occur you may believe that I am he .
43013020	Truly , truly , I tell you , he who receives any one whom I send receives me . He who receives me receives him who sent me . "
43013021	After saying these things Jesus was disturbed in spirit and solemnly said to them , " Truly , truly , I tell you , one of you will betray me . "
43013022	The disciples looked at one another wondering whom he meant .
43013023	One of his disciples was leaning on Jesus ' breast — the one Jesus loved .
43013024	Simon Peter nodded to him and said , " Say who it is that he is speaking of . "
43013025	He , leaning back on the breast of Jesus , said to him , " Master , who is it ? "
43013026	Jesus answered , " I will dip a piece of bread and give it to one . That is the man . " When he had dipped the bread , he took it and gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	After the piece of bread Satan entered into him . Jesus said to him , " What you are doing do quickly . "
43013028	No one of those reclining at the table understood why he said this to him .
43013029	Some thought , since Judas had the purse , that Jesus was telling him , " Buy what we need for the feast , " or to give something to the poor .
43013030	After taking the morsel Judas immediately went out . It was night .
43013031	When Judas had gone , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man has been glorified and God has been glorified in him .
43013032	If God has been glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself and immediately will glorify him .
43013033	Children , yet a little while I am with you . You will look for me and , as I said to the Jews , ' Where I am going you cannot come , ' so I say now to you .
43013034	A new command I give you , to love one another , as I have loved you — that so you love one another .
43013035	By this all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love to one another . "
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , " Master , where are you going ? " Jesus answered , " Where I am going you cannot follow me now ; but you will follow me later . "
43013037	Peter said to him , " Master , why cannot I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you . "
43013038	Jesus answered , " Will you lay down your life for me ? Truly , truly , I tell you , the cock will not crow before you have disowned me three times . "
43014001	" LET not your heart be troubled . Believe in God and believe in me .
43014002	In my Father's house are many abiding places . If it were not so I would have told you .
43014003	For I am going to prepare a place for you , and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and take you to myself , that where I am you may be also .
43014004	And to where I am going you know the way . "
43014005	Thomas said to him , " Master , we do not know where you are going . How can we know the way ? "
43014006	Jesus said to him , " I am the Way and the Truth and the Life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
43014007	If you had known me you would have known my Father also . But now you know him and have seen him . "
43014008	Philip said to him , " Master , show us the Father and we shall be satisfied . "
43014009	Jesus said , " Have I been so much time with you and you have not known me , Philip ? He who has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , ' Show us the Father ' ?
43014010	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words that I say to you I speak not of myself . The Father abides in me and does his works .
43014011	Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me . But if not , believe on account of the works themselves .
43014012	Truly , truly , I tell you , he who believes in me — the works that I am doing he also will do and greater works than these he will do , because I am going to the Father .
43014013	Whatever you ask in my name that I will do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	If you ask me anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	" If you love me , you will keep my commands ,
43014016	and I will ask the Father and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever —
43014017	the Spirit of Truth , whom the world cannot accept because it neither sees him nor knows him . But you know him because he abides with you and will be in you .
43014018	I will not leave you desolate ; I will come to you .
43014019	After a little while the world will no longer see me , but you will see me ; because I am living you too will live .
43014020	On that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you .
43014021	He who has my commands and keeps them — he is the one that loves me . He who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will show myself to him . "
43014022	Judas said to him , " Master , what has happened that you are going to show yourself to us and not to the world ? "
43014023	Jesus answered him , " If any one loves me , he will keep my word , and my Father will love him and we will come to him and abide with him .
43014024	He who loves me not does not keep my words . And the word that you hear is not mine , but is the word of the Father who sent me .
43014025	" These things I have spoken to you while yet with you .
43014026	The Counselor — the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name — will teach you all things and remind you of all that I have said to you .
43014027	Peace I leave with you . My peace I give to you . Not as the world gives do I give to you . Let not your heart be troubled , nor fearful .
43014028	You heard that I said to you I am going away and am coming back to you . If you loved me you would be glad that I am going to the Father , for the Father is greater than I .
43014029	Now I have told you before it comes to pass , that when it does come to pass you may believe .
43014030	I shall no longer speak much with you , for the Ruler of this world is coming and he has no part in me .
43014031	But that the world may know that I love the Father , even as the Father commanded me , so I am doing . Rise , let us go hence . "
43015001	" I AM the true Vine and my Father is the Vine-grower .
43015002	Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away , and every one that bears fruit he cleanses , that it may bear more fruit .
43015003	You are already clean through the word that I have spoken to you .
43015004	Abide in me and I in you . As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine , so neither can you unless you abide in me .
43015005	I am the Vine , you are the branches . He who abides in me and I in him — he bears much fruit ; but without me you cannot do anything .
43015006	If any one does not abide in me , he is cast out like a branch and withers , and they gather them and throw them into the fire and they are burned .
43015007	If you abide in me and my words abide in you , ask what you will and it will be done for you .
43015008	By this is my Father glorified — by your bearing much fruit and becoming my disciples .
43015009	As the Father has loved me , so have I loved you ; abide in my love .
43015010	If you keep my commands , you will abide in my love as I have kept my Father's commands and abide in his love .
43015011	These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made complete .
43015012	This is my command — to love one another as I have loved you .
43015013	Greater love has no one than this : to lay down his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	I no longer call you servants , for the servant does not know what his master is doing ; but I call you friends , for all that I have heard from the Father I have made known to you .
43015016	It was not you who chose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain , that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you .
43015017	These things I am commanding you that you may love one another .
43015018	" If the world hates you , you know that it hated me before it hated you .
43015019	If you were of the world the world would love its own . But you are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world . For this reason the world hates you .
43015020	Remember the word that I said to you , ' The servant is not superior to his Master . ' If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also . If they have kept my word , they will keep yours also .
43015021	But all these things they will do to you because of my name , because they do not know him who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have had sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	He who hates me hates my Father also .
43015024	If I had not done among them works which no other did , they would not have sin . But now they have seen and have hated both me and my Father .
43015025	But in order that the saying written in their Law may be fulfilled , ' They hated me without a cause . '
43015026	" When the Counselor comes , whom I will send to you from the Father — the Spirit of Truth who goes forth from the Father — he will witness concerning me .
43015027	And you are witnesses because you have been with me from the beginning . "
43016001	" THESE things I have spoken to you that you may not stumble and fall .
43016002	They will put you out of the synagogues . Indeed , the hour is coming when every one who kills you will think that he is offering a sacrifice to God .
43016003	These things they will do because they have not known the Father nor me .
43016004	But these things I have told you in order that when their hour comes you may remember them — that I told you . These things I did not tell you from the beginning because I was with you .
43016005	But now I am going to him who sent me , and no one of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
43016006	but , because I have said these things to you , grief has filled your hearts .
43016007	I tell you the truth , it is better for you that I should go away . For unless I go away , the Counselor will not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	And he , when he comes , will convince the world regarding sin and regarding righteousness and regarding judgment —
43016009	regarding sin , because they do not believe in me ;
43016010	regarding righteousness , because I am going to the Father and you no longer see me ;
43016011	regarding judgment , because the Ruler of this world has been judged .
43016012	I have still many things to tell you ; but you cannot bear them now .
43016013	But when he comes — the Spirit of Truth — he will guide you into all the truth . For he will not speak his own thoughts , but all that he hears he will speak and he will announce to you the things to come .
43016014	He will glorify me because he will take of mine and will announce it to you .
43016015	All things that the Father has are mine . For that reason I say , ' He will take of mine and announce it to you . '
43016016	After a little while you will no longer see me , and again a little while and you will see me . "
43016017	Some of his disciples said to one another , " What is this that he says , ' A little while and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me , ' and , ' because I am going to the Father ' ? "
43016018	So they said , " What is this that he says , ' A little while ' ? We do not know what he means . "
43016019	Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him , and he said to them , " Are you discussing with one another about this that I said , ' A little while and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me ' ?
43016020	Truly , truly , I tell you , you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice . You will grieve , but your grief will change into joy .
43016021	A woman when she is bringing forth has grief because her hour has come . But when she has borne the child , she no longer remembers her anguish for the joy that a human being has been born into the world .
43016022	And you have grief now , but I will see you again , and your heart will rejoice , and no one will take your joy from you .
43016023	On that day you will ask me no questions . Truly , truly , I tell you , if you ask the Father for anything in my name , he will give it to you .
43016024	So far you have asked for nothing in my name ; ask and you will obtain , that your joy may be made full .
43016025	" I have spoken these things to you in figures . The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
43016026	On that day you will ask in my name , and I do not tell you that I will make request of the Father for you ,
43016027	for the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from the Father's presence .
43016028	I came forth from the Father and have come into the world . Again I am leaving the world and am going to the Father . "
43016029	His disciples said , " See , now you are speaking plainly and are using no figures .
43016030	Now we know that you know all things and that you have no need to have any one question you . From this we believe that you have come forth from God . "
43016031	Jesus answered them , " Do you now believe ?
43016032	Indeed the hour is coming — it has come — for each one of you to be scattered to his own and leave me alone . Yet I am not alone , for the Father is with me .
43016033	I have spoken these things to you that in me you may have peace . In the world you have distress . But he courageous . I have conquered the world . "
43017001	THESE words spoke Jesus , and lifted his eyes to heaven and said , " Father , the hour has come . Glorify thy Son that the Son may glorify thee ,
43017002	as thou hast given him authority over all flesh , that he may give life eternal to all that thou hast given him .
43017003	This is life eternal , to know thee , the only true God , and him whom thou hast sent , Jesus Christ .
43017004	I have glorified thee on the earth by completing the work that thou gavest me to do .
43017005	And now glorify me , Father , at thy side with the glory that I had at thy side before the existence of the world .
43017006	I have revealed thy name to the men whom thou didst give me out of the world . Thine they were , and thou didst give them to me , and they have kept thy word .
43017007	Now they know that all the things that thou hast given me are from thee .
43017008	For the words that thou didst give me I have given them , and they have accepted them and have perceived truly that I came forth from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
43017009	" I pray for them . I do not pray for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me , for they are thine .
43017010	All mine are thine and thine are mine , and I have been glorified in them .
43017011	Now I am no longer in the world , but these are in the world , and I am coming to thee . Holy Father , keep in thy name those whom thou hast given to me , that they may be one , as we are .
43017012	When I was with them I kept in thy name those whom thou hast given to me , and I guarded them , and none of them has perished but the son of perdition , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
43017013	Now I am coming to thee , and these things I speak in the world that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
43017014	I have given them thy word and the world has hated them , because they are not of the world , just as I am not of the world .
43017015	I do not pray thee to take them out of the world , but to keep them from the evil .
43017016	They are not of the world , just as I am not of the world .
43017017	Make them holy through the truth . Thy word is truth .
43017018	As thou didst send me into the world , so have I sent them into the world ,
43017019	and for them I consecrate myself , that they may be consecrated through the truth .
43017020	" I pray not for them alone , but also for those who believe in me through their word ,
43017021	that all may be one , as thou , Father , art in me and I in thee , that they may be one in us , that the world may believe that thou didst send me .
43017022	The glory that thou hast given me I have given to them , that they may be one as we are one ,
43017023	I in them and thou in me , that they may be perfected into one , that the world may know that thou didst send me and didst love them just as thou didst love me .
43017024	Father , those thou didst give me — I will that they also may be with me where I am , to behold my glory which thou hast given me , for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
43017025	Righteous Father , the world did not know thee , but I knew thee , and these knew that thou didst send me .
43017026	I have made known thy name to them and will make it known , that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them . "
43018001	WHEN Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples across the brook Kidron to a place where there was a garden . Into this he entered with his disciples .
43018002	Judas who was betraying him knew the place , for Jesus often met with his disciples there .
43018003	So Judas , getting a battalion of soldiers and some subordinate officers of the high priests and the Pharisees , came there with torches and lamps and weapons .
43018004	Jesus , knowing all things that were coming upon him , came forward and said to them , " Whom are you seeking ? "
43018005	They answered him , " Jesus the Nazarene . " He said to them , " I am he . " Judas the traitor was standing with them .
43018006	When he said to them , " I am he , " they moved backward and fell to the ground .
43018007	Again he questioned them , " Whom are you seeking ? " They said , " Jesus the Nazarene . "
43018008	Jesus answered , " I have told you that I am he . If then you are seeking for me , let these go . "
43018009	He said this that the word might be fulfilled which he had spoken , " Of those whom thou hast given me I have lost none . "
43018010	Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it and struck a servant of the High Priest , cutting off his right ear . The servant's name was Malchus .
43018011	Jesus said to Peter , " Put your sword into its sheath . The cup that my Father has given me — shall I not drink it ? "
43018012	So the battalion and the Tribune and the Jewish policemen arrested Jesus and bound him
43018013	and took him first to Annas , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year .
43018014	Caiaphas was the man who had advised the Jews that it was best that one man should die for the people .
43018015	Simon Peter was following Jesus and so was another disciple . That disciple was known to the High Priest and he went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest .
43018016	Peter stood by the gate outside . The other disciple , who was known to the High Priest , went out and spoke to the girl at the door and brought in Peter .
43018017	The girl at the door said to Peter , " You are not one of this man's disciples , too , are you ? " He said , " I am not . "
43018018	The servants and policemen were standing there . They had made a fire , for it was cold , and were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
43018019	The High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered him , " I have spoken frankly to the world . I constantly taught in synagogues and in the Temple courts where all the Jews assemble , and I have spoken nothing in secret .
43018021	Why do you question me ? Question my hearers what I said to them . Certainly they know what I said . "
43018022	When he said this , a policeman , who was standing by , gave Jesus a slap , saying , " Do you answer the High Priest that way ? "
43018023	Jesus answered him , " If I have spoken wrongly , bear witness against me of the wrong ; but if I have spoken rightly , why do you strike me ? "
43018024	Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest .
43018025	Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . They said to him , " Are not you also one of his disciples ? " He denied it and said , " I am not . "
43018026	One of the servants of the High Priest , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , said , " Did I not see you in the garden with him ? "
43018027	Again Peter denied , and immediately a cock crowed .
43018028	They led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Castle . It was early morning . The Jews did not enter the Castle , wishing to avoid defilement , so that they might eat the Passover .
43018029	Pilate went out to them and said , " What charge do you bring against this man ? "
43018030	They answered , " If he were not an evil-doer , we should not have handed him over to you . "
43018031	Pilate said to them , " Take him yourselves and judge him by your law . " The Jews said to him , " It is not lawful for us to put any one to death . "
43018032	They said this that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled — the word he had spoken indicating by what death he was to die .
43018033	Pilate entered the Castle again and called Jesus and said to him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? "
43018034	Jesus answered , " Do you say this of yourself or did others tell you about me ? "
43018035	Pilate answered , " I am not a Jew , am I ? Your nation and the high priests have handed you over to me . What have you done ? "
43018036	Jesus answered , " My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , my subordinates would be fighting to prevent my being delivered up to the Jews . But now my kingdom is not from here . "
43018037	Pilate said to him , " Are you not a king then ? " Jesus answered , " I am a king , as you say . For this I was born and for this I have come into the world , to bear witness to the truth . Every one who is of the truth listens to my voice . "
43018038	Pilate said to him , " What is truth ? " After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them , " I find no crime in him .
43018039	But you have a custom that I should release for you one at the Passover . Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews ? "
43018040	They shouted again , saying , " Not this man , but Barabbas ! " Barabbas was a robber .
43019001	THEN Pilate took Jesus and scourged him .
43019002	The soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and placed it on his head , threw around him a purple cloak ,
43019003	and kept coming up to him and saying , " Hail , King of the Jews ! " and slapping him .
43019004	Pilate went out again and said to them , " See , I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no crime in him . "
43019005	Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak . Pilate said to them , " Here is the man ! "
43019006	When the high priests and their subordinates saw him , they shouted , " Crucify him , crucify him ! " Pilate said , " You take him and crucify him . For I find no crime in him . "
43019007	The Jews answered , " We have a law and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . "
43019008	When Pilate heard that , he was more alarmed
43019009	and went into the Castle and said to Jesus , " Where do you come from ? " But Jesus gave him no answer .
43019010	Pilate said to him , " Do you not speak to me ? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you ? "
43019011	Jesus answered , " You would not have any authority over me if it were not given you from above . For this reason he who delivered me to you has a greater sin . "
43019012	After this , Pilate kept trying to release him , but the Jews shouted , " If you let this man go you are not a friend of Caesar . Every one who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar . "
43019013	Pilate , on hearing these words , brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat in the place called the Mosaic Pavement — in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
43019014	It was the Preparation Day of the Passover , about noon . He said to the Jews , " See your king ! "
43019015	They shouted , " Away with him , away with him ! Crucify him ! " Pilate said to them , " Shall I crucify your king ? " The high priests answered , " We have no king but Caesar . "
43019016	Then he delivered him to them to be crucified . So they took Jesus
43019017	and laid on him his cross and went out to what is called Skull Place — in Hebrew , Golgotha —
43019018	where they crucified him . And with him they crucified two others , one on this side and one on that , and Jesus between them .
43019019	Pilate wrote a sign and put it up on the cross . It was written : JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS
43019020	Many of the Jews read this sign , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek .
43019021	The high priests of the Jews said to Pilate , " Do not write , ' The King of the Jews , ' but , ' This man said , I am King of the Jews . ' "
43019022	Pilate answered , " What I have written , I have written . "
43019023	The soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his clothes and made four parts , a part to each soldier , and there was his tunic besides . The tunic was seamless , woven from the top entire .
43019024	They said to one another , " Let us not tear it , but cast lots who shall have it . " This was so that the Scripture might be fulfilled , " They parted my garments among them and on my clothing they cast lots . " The soldiers did this .
43019025	There were standing beside the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , there is your son . "
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , " There is your mother . " From that hour the disciple took her to his own home .
43019028	After this , Jesus knowing that now all things had been completed , in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled said , " I am thirsty . "
43019029	A pitcher was standing there full of sour wine . Putting a sponge full of sour wine on a hyssop stem , they raised it to his mouth .
43019030	When Jesus had taken the sour wine , he said , " It is finished , " and bowing his head gave up his spirit .
43019031	The Jews , because it was Preparation Day , in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath , for that Sabbath was a great day , requested Pilate to have their legs broken to kill them .
43019032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with him .
43019033	But , coming to Jesus , when they saw him already dead , they did not break his legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers with his spear pierced his side and immediately there came forth blood and water .
43019035	He who saw it has borne witness and his witness is true , and he knows that he speaks the truth in order that you may believe .
43019036	For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled , " A bone of him shall not be broken . "
43019037	And again another Scripture says , " They will look on him whom they have pierced . "
43019038	After this , Joseph of Arimathaea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked of Pilate permission to carry away the body of Jesus , and Pilate granted it . So he came and carried his body away .
43019039	Nicodemus , the man who came to him at first by night , came also bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds weight .
43019040	They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices , according to the custom of the Jews in preparing for burial .
43019041	There was in the place where he had been crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had been laid .
43019042	There , on account of the Preparation of the Jews , because the tomb was near , they laid Jesus .
43020001	ON the first day of the week , early in the morning while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken from the tomb .
43020002	She ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and said to them , " They have taken away the Master from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him . "
43020003	Simon Peter and the other disciple went out and made their way to the tomb .
43020004	They were both running , and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb ,
43020005	and stooping he saw the linen cloths lying ; but he did not enter .
43020006	Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb and looked at the linen cloths lying
43020007	and the handkerchief that had been about his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but rolled up in a place apart .
43020008	Then the other disciple who had come first to the tomb entered , and he saw and believed .
43020009	For they did not yet know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples went back to where they were staying .
43020011	Mary was standing by the tomb outside weeping . As she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb
43020012	and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain .
43020013	They said to her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? " She said to them , " Because they have carried away my Master and I do not know where they have laid him . "
43020014	After saying this , she turned and saw Jesus standing , but did not recognize that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , " Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you seeking ? " She , thinking that he was the gardener , said to him , " Sir , if you have removed him , tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away . "
43020016	Jesus said to her , " Mary ! " She turned and said to him in Hebrew , " Rabboni ! " .
43020017	Jesus said to her , " Do not cling to me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father . But go to my brethren and say to them , ' I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . '
43020018	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples , " I have seen the Master , " and she told that he had said these things to her .
43020019	In the evening of that day , the first day of the week , when the doors had been closed where the disciples were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them , " Peace be with you . "
43020020	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . The disciples were filled with joy on seeing the Master .
43020021	He said to them again , " Peace be with you . As the Father sent me forth so I am sending you . "
43020022	When he had said this , he breathed on them and said , " Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive the sins of any , they are forgiven . If you retain the sins of any , they are retained . "
43020024	Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	The other disciples said to him , " We have seen the Master . " But he said to them , " Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and put my hand into his side , I will not believe it . "
43020026	After eight days the disciples were again within and Thomas was with them . Jesus came and stood in the midst and said , " Peace be with you . "
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , " Reach your finger here . Here are my hands . Reach your hand and put it into my side , and become not faithless , but believing . "
43020028	Thomas answered him , " My Lord and my God ! "
43020029	Jesus said to him , " Because you have seen me you have believed . Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed . "
43020030	Jesus did before the disciples many other signs which are not written in this book .
43020031	But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing you may have life through his name .
43021001	AFTER this , Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Lake of Tiberias . He showed himself in this way .
43021002	There were together Simon Peter and Thomas , called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , " I am going fishing . " They said , " We will go along with you . " They went out and got into a boat , but that night they caught nothing .
43021004	When day was breaking , Jesus stood on the beach . The disciples , however , did not recognize that it was Jesus .
43021005	Jesus said to them , " Children , have you anything to eat ? " They answered him , " No . "
43021006	He said to them , " Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some . " They cast , and now they could not draw it in for the multitude of fishes .
43021007	That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , " It is the Master ! " Simon Peter , on hearing that it was the Master , girded around him his blouse , for he was naked , and threw himself into the lake .
43021008	The other disciples came in the small boat , for they were not far from land — about a hundred yards — dragging the netful of fish .
43021009	When they had gotten out on land , they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it and bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , " Bring some of the fish that you have just caught . "
43021011	Simon Peter got into the boat and drew the net to land full of big fishes — a hundred and fifty-three — and though there were so many the net was not torn .
43021012	Jesus said , " Come , take break-fast . " No one of the disciples dared to ask him who he was , knowing that it was the Master .
43021013	Jesus came and took bread and gave to them , and fish in the same manner .
43021014	This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead .
43021015	When they had breakfasted , Jesus said to Simon Peter , " Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? " He said to him , " Yes , Master , you know that I love you . " He said to him , " Feed my lambs . "
43021016	He said to him a second time , " Simon , son of John , do you love me ? " He said to him , " Yes , Master , you know that I love you . " He said to him , " Shepherd my sheep . "
43021017	He said to him the third time , " Simon , son of John , do you love me ? " Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time , " Do you love me ? " and he said to him , " Master , you know all things . You know that I love you . " Jesus said to him , " Feed my sheep .
43021018	Truly , truly , I tell you , when you were young , you girded yourself and walked about wherever you wished . When you are old , you will stretch out your hands and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish . "
43021019	This he said , indicating the kind of death by which he would glorify God . After saying this he said to him , " Follow me . "
43021020	Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved , following .
43021021	Peter , seeing him , said to Jesus , " Master , what shall this man do ? "
43021022	Jesus said to him , " If I choose to have him stay until I come , what is that to you ? You must follow me . "
43021023	So the report went out among the brethren that that disciple was not to die . But Jesus did not say to Peter that he would not die , but , " If I choose to have him stay until I come , what is that to you ? "
43021024	This is the disciple who witnesses to these things and who wrote these things , and we know that his testimony is true .
43021025	There are also many other things that Jesus did , but if these are written , every one , I do not think that the world itself will have room for the books when written .
44001001	IN my first book , Theophilus , I told of all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning
44001002	down to the day when , after giving commands , through the Holy Spirit , to the apostles whom he had chosen , he was taken up to heaven .
44001003	By many proofs he revealed himself to these men as still alive after his sufferings ; for he was seen by them for forty days and spoke of things relating to the kingdom of God .
44001004	Also while eating with them , he charged them not to leave Jerusalem , but to wait for the promise of the Father , " which , " said he , " you have heard from me .
44001005	For John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence . "
44001006	When they came together , they asked him , " Master , will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel ? "
44001007	He said to them , " It is not yours to know the times and seasons which the Father has put under his own authority .
44001008	But you will receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you , and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and in Samaria and to the ends of the earth . "
44001009	He said this and then , while they were looking on , he was taken up and a cloud lifted him from their sight .
44001010	They were gazing into the sky as he went , when suddenly two men in white robes were standing beside them
44001011	and said , " Men of Galilee , why are you standing and looking up into the sky ? This Jesus , who has been taken from you into heaven , will come back in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven . "
44001012	They then returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Olive Orchard , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day's journey distant .
44001013	When they came into the city , they went up to the upper room where they were staying . There were Peter and John , and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot , and Judas the son of James .
44001014	All of these continued earnestly and unitedly in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers .
44001015	In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren and said :
44001016	" Brethren , it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David concerning Judas , who became guide to those who arrested Jesus .
44001017	For he was numbered among us and received a share in this service .
44001018	( This man bought a piece of land with the price of his wickedness , and falling headlong he burst asunder and all his entrails were poured out .
44001019	It became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that that field was called in their own language Akeldama , that is , the Field of Blood . )
44001020	For it is written in the book of Psalms , ' Let his dwelling become desolate and let there be no one living in it , ' and , ' His overseership let another take . '
44001021	It is needful , therefore , that of the men who have been with us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
44001022	from the baptism of John down to the day that he was taken up from us — that one of these should become a witness with us of his resurrection . "
44001023	So they put forward two , Joseph who is called Barsabbas , surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
44001024	In prayer they said , " O Lord , thou who knowest the hearts of all , show which one of these two thou has chosen
44001025	to take the place in this service and apostleship which Judas deserted to go to his own place . "
44001026	Then they cast lots between them . The lot fell on Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
44002001	DURING the course of the day of Pentecost they were all together in the same place ,
44002002	when suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a strong rushing wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
44002003	Then there appeared to them , as it were , tongues of flame distributing themselves , and one rested on each of them .
44002004	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues , as the Spirit gave them power of expression .
44002005	There were Jews living in Jerusalem , pious men from every nation under heaven .
44002006	When this sound was heard , the crowd came together and were astonished because each one heard them speaking in his own language .
44002007	They were amazed and , wondering , said , " Are not all these who are talking , Galilaean ?
44002008	How then does each of us hear them in his own native language ?
44002009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those who live in Mesopotamia , Judas and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphilia , Egypt and the regions of Libya toward Cyrene , visitors from Rome , Jews and proselytes ,
44002011	Cretans and Arabians — we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God . "
44002012	They were all astonished and at a loss , one saying to another , " What does this mean ? "
44002013	Some scoffingly said , " They are full of sweet wine . "
44002014	But Peter , standing up with the eleven , raised his voice and declared to them : " Fellow Jews , and all of you who live in Jerusalem , understand this and listen to my words .
44002015	These are not drunk , as you assume , for it is only nine o'clock in the morning ;
44002016	but this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel :
44002017	' It will be in the last days , says God , that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind , and your sons and your daughters will prophesy , and your young men will see visions , and your old men will dream dreams .
44002018	Yes , upon the slave men and slave girls that are mine I will pour out my Spirit in those days , and they will prophesy .
44002019	I will give portents in heaven above and signs on the earth beneath , blood and fire and vapor of smoke .
44002020	The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes — that great and glorious day .
44002021	And every one who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . '
44002022	Fellow Israelites , listen to these words : Jesus the Nazarene was a man proved to be sent to you from God by miracles , wonders , and signs which God did through him in the midst of you , as you yourselves know .
44002023	But when he had been delivered up according to the fixed purpose and foreknowledge of God , you crucified and killed him through the hands of lawless men .
44002024	But God freed him from the pangs of death and raised him up , since it was impossible that he should be held under the power of death .
44002025	For David says of him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , for he is at my right hand so that I may not be cast down .
44002026	Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices , and my flesh still dwells in hope
44002027	that thou wilt not leave my soul to Hades and wilt not let thy holy one see decay .
44002028	Thou makest me know the paths of life . Thou wilt fill me with joy in thy presence . '
44002029	" Brethren , allow me to say frankly to you regarding the patriarch David that he died and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day .
44002030	But being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn to him an oath to place a descendant of his body upon his throne ,
44002031	he foreseeing spoke of the resurrection of the Christ , saying that he was not left to Hades and that his flesh did not see decay .
44002032	This Jesus , God raised up , and all of us are witnesses of it .
44002033	Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this which you see and hear .
44002034	For David did not ascend into the heavens , but he says , ' The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand ,
44002035	till I make your enemies your footstool . '
44002036	Let all the house of Israel know surely that this Jesus , whom you crucified , God has made both Lord and Christ . "
44002037	Hearing this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles , " What shall we do , brethren ? "
44002038	Peter said to them , " Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ , for the forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all those who are far off , as many as the Lord your God may call . "
44002040	With many other words he bore witness and exhorted them , " Save yourselves from this perverse generation . "
44002041	Those who accepted his message were baptized , and there were added on that day about three thousand souls .
44002042	These gave constant attention to the teaching of the apostles and to the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers .
44002043	Awe came on every soul . Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
44002044	All who believed had all things together in common .
44002045	They would sell their lands and goods and distribute to all as any one had need .
44002046	Every day , continuing with one accord in the Temple courts and in breaking bread from house to house , they ate together in joy and simplicity of heart ,
44002047	praising God and having favor with all the people . The Lord added daily to their number those who were being saved .
44003001	PETER and John were going up into the Temple courts at the hour of prayer , three o'clock ,
44003002	when a man lame from his birth was being carried along . This man used to be placed every day near the gate of the Temple courts — the one called the Beautiful Gate — to beg of those who were entering .
44003003	Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple courts , he begged to receive something .
44003004	But Peter fixing his eyes on him , along with John , said , " Look at us . "
44003005	He gave attention to them , expecting to receive something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , " Silver and gold I have not ; but what I have I will give you . In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , walk . "
44003007	Grasping his right hand he lifted him up . Immediately his feet and ankles became strong ,
44003008	and he sprang up and stood and walked and entered the Temple court with them , walking and leaping and praising God .
44003009	All the people saw him walking about and praising God ,
44003010	and when they recognized that it was he who had sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple court , they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him .
44003011	While he still clung to Peter and John , all the people ran crowding around them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade , greatly astonished .
44003012	Peter , seeing the people , explained , " Fellow Israelites , why do you wonder at this , or why do you gaze so at us , as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glorified his servant Jesus whom you delivered up and disowned before Pilate when he had decided to release him .
44003014	You disowned the holy and righteous one and begged to have a murderer granted you .
44003015	You killed the Author of life , but God raised him from the dead . Of this we are witnesses .
44003016	And now by faith in his name this man whom you see and know has been made strong by his name , and the faith that is through him has given this man this perfect soundness before you all .
44003017	" Now , brethren , I know that you acted in ignorance , as also your rulers did .
44003018	God in this way fulfilled what he had predicted through the mouths of all the prophets that his Christ should suffer .
44003019	Therefore , repent and turn about , that your sins may be wiped away and the gracious face of the Lord may bring times of refreshing ,
44003020	and he may send Jesus Christ , long ago appointed ,
44003021	but whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things , of which God spoke through the mouths of his holy prophets of old .
44003022	" Moses indeed said , ' The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brethren , as he raised me ; listen to all that he may say to you .
44003023	It shall be that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
44003024	And all the prophets , Samuel and those who followed him , all who spoke , also foretold these days .
44003025	You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God established with your fathers when he said to Abraham , ' In your descendants all the families of the earth will be blessed . '
44003026	To you first God , when he raised up his servant , sent him , to bless you by turning each one of you from his wicked ways . "
44004001	WHILE they were speaking to the people , the priests and the commandant of the Temple and the Sadducees came upon them ,
44004002	being offended because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in the case of Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44004003	They laid hands on them and placed them in custody until the next day , for it was already evening .
44004004	But many of those who had heard the message believed , and the number of the men grew to be about five thousand .
44004005	On the next day there was a gathering of their rulers and elders and scribes in Jerusalem ,
44004006	with Annas the High Priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all who were of high priestly race .
44004007	They placed the apostles in the midst and asked them , " By what power and in what name did you do this ? "
44004008	Then Peter , full of the Holy Spirit , said to them , " Rulers of the people and elders ,
44004009	if we must answer to-day regarding a benefit done to an infirm man , by what name he has been healed ,
44004010	be it known to all of you and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead — by this name , this man stands here before you sound .
44004011	This is the stone which was despised by you the builders , and which has become the corner stone .
44004012	Nor is there salvation in any other . For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved . "
44004013	Observing the fearless outspokenness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were common , uneducated men , they were astonished , and they recognized them as former companions of Jesus .
44004014	Seeing the man who had been healed standing there with the apostles , they had nothing to say in opposition .
44004015	After ordering them to go out of the council , they conferred together ,
44004016	saying , " What shall we do to these men ? For that a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all who live in Jerusalem , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But that it may not spread further among the people , let us sternly forbid them to speak any longer in this name to any one . "
44004018	So , calling them in , they commanded them absolutely not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John answered them , " Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves .
44004020	We , for our part , cannot refrain from saying what we have seen and heard . "
44004021	The Council after further threats set them at liberty , not finding any way to punish them on account of the people ; for all were giving glory to God because of what had happened .
44004022	For the man upon whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old .
44004023	The apostles upon being released came to their friends and told them all that the high priests and the elders had said .
44004024	They hearing it unitedly lifted up their prayer to God and said , " O Lord , thou who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them ,
44004025	who through the Holy Spirit by the mouth of our father David , thy servant , didst say , ' Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things ?
44004026	The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers are gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ ' —
44004027	for truly in this city Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , were gathered against thy holy servant Jesus ,
44004028	to do all that thy hands and thy will had predetermined should take place —
44004029	now , Lord , look upon their threats and enable thy servants to speak thy message with all fearlessness ,
44004030	while thou dost stretch out thine hand for healing and while signs and wonders are done through the name of thy holy servant Jesus . "
44004031	After this prayer the place in which they were assembled was shaken , and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the message of God with courageous freedom .
44004032	The multitude of those who had believed was of one heart and one soul , and no one said that any part of his property was his own , but they had all things in common .
44004033	With great power the apostles continued to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus . Great grace was upon them all .
44004034	Nor was any one in need among them , for all who were owners of lands or houses would sell them and bring the money for what had been sold
44004035	and lay it at the apostles ' feet , and it would be distributed to each as he had need .
44004036	Joseph , to whom the apostles had given the name Barnabas , which means " Son of Encouragement , " a Levite born in Cyprus ,
44004037	being the owner of a farm , sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
44005001	BUT a man called Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a piece of property
44005002	and kept back a part of the price , with his wife's connivance , and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
44005003	Peter said , " Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land ?
44005004	While you had it , was it not yours ? And after it was sold , was it not at your own disposal ? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart ? You have not lied to men , but to God . "
44005005	When Ananias heard these words he fell down and died . Great fear came upon all who heard these words .
44005006	Then the young men arose and wrapped him in a shroud and carried him out and buried him .
44005007	After an interval of about three hours , Ananias ' wife came in , not knowing what had happened .
44005008	Peter asked her , " Tell me , did you sell the land for so much ? " She answered , " Yes , for so much . "
44005009	Peter said to her , " Why was it agreed between you to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Even now the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out . "
44005010	Immediately she fell down at his feet and died . The young men came in and found her dead , and carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	Great awe came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things .
44005012	Many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles . They were all with one purpose in Solomon's Colonnade .
44005013	Of the rest no one dared join them , but the people honored them highly .
44005014	Believers in the Lord were more and more being added , crowds both of men and of women ,
44005015	so that they carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on couches and pallets with the hope that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some one of them .
44005016	A crowd was coming too from the towns around Jerusalem , bringing sick people and those who were troubled by impure spirits , and these were all being healed .
44005017	But the High Priest and all his party — the sect of the Sadducees — became aroused and filled with indignation ,
44005018	and laid hands on the apostles and put them into the public jail .
44005019	But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors in the night and led them out and said ,
44005020	" Go , stand and speak to the people in the Temple courts all the words of this life . "
44005021	On hearing this they went into the Temple courts about daybreak and began teaching . When the High Priest and his party arrived , they called together the Council and all the eldership of the children of Israel and sent to the jail to have the men brought .
44005022	But when the officers came there they did not find them in the prison . They returned and reported ,
44005023	" We found the prison shut with all security and the guards standing at the doors , but when we opened we found no one inside . "
44005024	On hearing these words the commandant of the Temple and the high priests were at a loss as to what this would grow into .
44005025	Then some one came and told them , " The men whom you put in jail are standing in the Temple courts and teaching the people . "
44005026	Then the commandant with his subordinates went and brought them , but without violence , for they were afraid of being stoned by the people .
44005027	They brought them in and made them stand before the Council . The High Priest asked them ,
44005028	" Did we not strictly order you not to teach in this name ? And here you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and want to bring this man's blood on us . "
44005029	Peter , answering for the apostles , said , " God must be obeyed rather than men .
44005030	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a cross .
44005031	God has exalted him as Leader and Savior at his own right hand to give to Israel change of heart and forgiveness of sins .
44005032	We are witnesses of these things , and so is the Holy Spirit which God has given to those who obey him . "
44005033	On hearing this they became furious and wanted to kill them .
44005034	But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel — a teacher of the law honored by all the people — arose in the Council and , after directing that the men should be taken outside for a little while ,
44005035	said , " Men of Israel , consider carefully what you are going to do to these men .
44005036	For before these days arose Theudas , professing to be somebody . A number of men , about four hundred , joined themselves to him . But he was slain and all who followed him were scattered and came to naught .
44005037	After him arose Judas the Galilean , in the days of the Census , and led away people after him . He too perished , and all who followed him were scattered .
44005038	And now I advise you to keep away from these men and let them alone , for if this plan or work is of men it will collapse ,
44005039	but if it is of God you will not be able to suppress them . You might even be found to be fighting against God . "
44005040	They were persuaded by him . So they called in the apostles and gave them a flogging and ordered them not to go on speaking in the name of Jesus , and then set them at liberty ;
44005041	but they went away from before the Council rejoicing because they were thought worthy to be put to shame for the Name .
44005042	And every day in the Temple courts and from house to house they unceasingly taught and told the good news of Jesus the Christ .
44006001	IN those days , when the number of disciples was increasing , the Greek-speaking Jews began to grumble at the Hebrew Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily service .
44006002	Then the twelve called the body of disciples together and said , " We do not wish to leave the message of God and wait on tables .
44006003	Therefore , brethren , pick out seven men from among you , men of reputation , full of the Spirit and of wisdom , and we will appoint them to look after this need .
44006004	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the service of the message . "
44006005	This proposal pleased the whole body . So they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus , a proselyte from Antioch .
44006006	These they presented before the apostles , who after prayer laid their hands upon them .
44006007	The message of God continued to spread and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly , and even a great body of the priests were obedient to the faith .
44006008	Stephen , full of grace and of power , was doing great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	But certain persons from what was called the synagogue of the Libyans and Cyrenians and Alexandrians , and some from Cilicia and Asia , rose up and disputed with Stephen ;
44006010	yet they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke .
44006011	Then they got some men to say , " We have heard him speaking profane words against Moses and against God . "
44006012	They excited the people and the elders and the scribes , and coming suddenly upon Stephen they arrested him and led him to the Council .
44006013	There they put forward false witnesses who said , " This man never ceases saying things against this holy place and the law .
44006014	We have heard him say that this Jesus , the Nazarene , will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed down to us . "
44006015	All who were sitting in the Council as they looked at him saw that his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	THE High Priest said , " Are these things true ? "
44007002	Stephen said : " Brethren and Fathers , listen . The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia , before he lived in Haran ,
44007003	and said to him , ' Leave your land and your kindred and go into whatever land I shall show you . '
44007004	Then he came out from the land of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran . From there , after the death of his father , God removed him into this land in which you now live ,
44007005	but he did not give him any inheritance in it , not even a foot of it . Still he promised to give it as a possession to him and to his descendants after him , though at that time he had no child .
44007006	God spoke thus , ' His descendants will sojourn in a land not their own , and they will be enslaved and maltreated four hundred years . '
44007007	And God said , ' That nation by which they are enslaved I will judge , and after that they shall come out and serve me in this place . '
44007008	God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision . So Abraham circumcised his son Isaac on the eighth day , and Isaac circumcised his son Jacob , and Jacob circumcised his sons , the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	" The patriarchs becoming jealous of Joseph sold him into Egypt . But God was with him
44007010	and delivered him out of all his trials , and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who made him governor over the land of Egypt and all his own house .
44007011	Then there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan , and great distress , and our fathers found no food .
44007012	When Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt he sent our fathers the first time .
44007013	On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers , and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh .
44007014	Then Joseph sent and invited down Jacob his father and all his relatives , seventy-five persons ,
44007015	and Jacob went down into Egypt and died there — he and our fathers .
44007016	They were brought to Shechem and buried in the tomb which Abraham bought for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	" As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt
44007018	until there arose to rule over Egypt a different king , who did not know Joseph .
44007019	He adopted a crafty policy toward our race and oppressed our fathers , forcing them to expose their babes so that they should not be kept alive .
44007020	" At that time Moses was born , and was beautiful in God's sight . For three months he was cared for in his father's house .
44007021	When he had been exposed , Pharaoh's daughter took him up and reared him as her own son .
44007022	Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was strong in words and in deeds .
44007023	When he reached the age of forty years it came into his heart to look after his brethren , the children of Israel .
44007024	Seeing one of them being wronged , he defended him and did justice for the injured man by striking down the Egyptian .
44007025	He thought that his brethren knew that God would give them freedom through his hand . But they did not understand it .
44007026	On the next day Moses appeared when two of them were fighting , and tried to make peace between them , saying , ' Men , you are brethren . Why are you injuring each other ? '
44007027	But he who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away , saying , ' Who appointed you a ruler and judge over us ?
44007028	Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday ? '
44007029	At that word Moses fled and became a sojourner in the land of Midian , and there he had two sons .
44007030	" When forty years had passed , an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in the flames of a burning bush .
44007031	When Moses saw the sight he was astonished , but as he was approaching to look closely , the voice of the Lord was heard ,
44007032	' I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob . ' Then Moses trembled and did not dare to look closely .
44007033	The Lord said to him , ' Loose your sandals from your feet , for the place on which you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	I have plainly seen the distress of my people in Egypt and I have heard their groans and have come down to deliver them . Come now and I will send you to Egypt . '
44007035	" This Moses whom they disowned , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and judge ? ' — this man God sent as ruler and deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them out , doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years .
44007037	This is the Moses who said , ' God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren . '
44007038	This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness , with the angel who spoke to him in Mount Sinai and with our fathers , and he received the living words to give to us .
44007039	Our fathers would not obey him , but thrust him away and turned back in their hearts toward Egypt ,
44007040	saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods to lead us ; for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt — we do not know what has become of him . '
44007041	And they made the image of a calf in those days and brought sacrifices to the idol and rejoiced in the work of their own hands .
44007042	So God turned and gave them up to worship the stars of heaven , as it is written in the book of the prophets , ' Did you offer to me slaughtered animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness , O house of Israel ?
44007043	No , you carried the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan , the images that you made for worship . Therefore I will remove you beyond Babylon . '
44007044	" In the wilderness our fathers had the Tent of the Testimony made as he who spoke to Moses directed , according to the model which he had seen .
44007045	This Tent our fathers who were with Joshua received in their turn and brought into the land of the nations whom God drove out from before our fathers , and it remained until the days of David .
44007046	He found favor with God and prayed that he might provide a temple for the house of Israel .
44007047	But Solomon built for him a house .
44007048	Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings made by hands ; as the prophet says ,
44007049	' Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool . What sort of house will you build for me , says the Lord , or what is my place of rest ?
44007050	Did not my hand make all these things ? '
44007051	" You stiff-necked men , uncircumcised in hearts and ears , you always resist the Holy Spirit ! As your fathers did , so do you .
44007052	Which one of the prophets did not your fathers persecute ? Yes , they killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one of whom now you have become the betrayers and murderers —
44007053	you who received the law as it was transmitted by angels and have not kept it . "
44007054	As they listened to these things they were cut to the heart and ground their teeth at him .
44007055	But he being full of the Holy Spirit looked up into heaven and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing at God's right hand ,
44007056	and he said , " I see heaven opened and the Son of Man standing at God's right hand ! "
44007057	With a great shout they stopped their ears and rushed upon him with one purpose ,
44007058	and hurried him out of the city and stoned him . The witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	They stoned Stephen as he was praying and saying , " Lord Jesus , receive my spirit . "
44007060	Kneeling he cried aloud , " Lord , do not lay up this sin against them ! " After saying this he fell asleep .
44008001	SAUL also approved of their putting him to death . On that day arose a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem . All except the apostles were scattered through Judaea and Samaria .
44008002	Pious men carried Stephen away for burial and made great lamentation over him .
44008003	Saul cruelly hounded the church from house to house , entering and dragging out men and women and handing them over into prison .
44008004	Those who were scattered went to various places telling the good news .
44008005	Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them .
44008006	The crowds with one mind gave attention to what was said by Philip , listening to his words and seeing the signs that he did .
44008007	For impure spirits came out shrieking from many who had been possessed , and many paralytic and lame people were healed .
44008008	There was great rejoicing in that city .
44008009	A certain man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria , giving out that he was some great one .
44008010	They had all given attention to him , from the least to the greatest , saying , " This man is the power of God which is called great . "
44008011	They had given attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them by his magic .
44008012	But when they believed Philip , who was telling the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
44008013	Simon himself also believed and was baptized and attached himself to Philip , and seeing the signs and great miracles that took place he was astonished .
44008014	When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the message of God , they sent to them Peter and John .
44008015	They on arrival prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	For the Spirit had not yet fallen on any one of them ; they had merely been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles ' hands , he offered them money ,
44008019	saying , " Give to me also this power that whoever I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit . "
44008020	But Peter said to him , " Your money perish with you because you have thought that you could buy the gift of God with money !
44008021	You have no part or lot in this matter . For your heart is not right before God .
44008022	Repent of this wickedness of yours , and pray the Lord that , if possible , the thought of your heart may be forgiven you .
44008023	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the fetters of unrighteousness . "
44008024	Simon answered , " You pray for me to the Lord that nothing of what you have said may come on me . "
44008025	So when they had borne their testimony and had spoken the message of the Lord , they returned to Jerusalem , telling the good news in many villages of the Samaritans .
44008026	An angel of the Lord said to Philip , " Arise and go south-ward on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza , the road through the desert . "
44008027	He arose and went . Now there was a man of Ethiopia , a eunuch of high rank under Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was over her treasury . He had been to Jerusalem to worship
44008028	and was on his return , sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	The Spirit said to Philip , " Go up and join this chariot . "
44008030	Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet , and said , " Do you understand what you are reading ? "
44008031	He said , " How can I without some one to guide me ? " He begged Philip to come up and sit with him .
44008032	The passage of Scripture that he was reading was , " He was led as a sheep to slaughter , and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb , so he did not open his mouth .
44008033	In his humiliation justice was denied him . Who will describe his generation ? For his life is taken away from the earth . "
44008034	The eunuch said to Philip , " Please tell me , of whom is the prophet speaking — of himself or of some one else ? "
44008035	Philip opened his mouth and beginning with that Scripture told him the good news about Jesus .
44008036	As they were going along the road they came to water , and the eunuch said , " Here is water . What is there to hinder my being baptized ? "
44008038	He ordered the chariot to stop and they both went down into the water , Philip and the eunuch , and he baptized him .
44008039	When they had come up out of the water , the Spirit caught away Philip , and the eunuch saw him no more . He went on his way rejoicing .
44008040	But Philip found himself at Azotus , and passing through all the cities he told the good news until he came to Casarea .
44009001	SAUL was still breathing out threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord . He went to the High Priest
44009002	and asked from him letters to the synagogues in Damascus , that if he should find any persons who were of the Way , whether men or women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
44009003	On his journey he was getting near to Damascus when suddenly a light from heaven flashed round him .
44009004	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , " Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? "
44009005	He asked , " Who is speaking ? " The answer was , " I am Jesus whom you are persecuting .
44009006	But stand up and go into the city and it will be told you what you must do . "
44009007	The men who were on the road with him stood struck dumb , hearing the voice , but seeing no one .
44009008	Saul rose from the earth and opened his eyes , but he could see nothing . Taking him by the hand they led him into Damascus ,
44009009	and he was three days without seeing , and neither ate nor drank .
44009010	There was in Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias . The Lord said to him in a vision , " Ananias . " He answered , " Here I am , Lord . "
44009011	The Lord said to him , " Rise and go to the street called Straight street , and ask in the house of Judas for a man named Saul from Tarsus . He is now in prayer ,
44009012	and has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him in order that he may receive his sight . "
44009013	Ananias answered , " Lord , I have heard about this man from many people — how many wicked things he has done to thy holy ones in Jerusalem ,
44009014	and here he has authority from the high priests to bind all who call upon thy name . "
44009015	But the Lord said to him , " Go , for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before nations and kings and the children of Israel .
44009016	I will show him how much he must suffer for my name . "
44009017	Ananias went and entered the house and put his hands on Saul , and said , " Brother Saul , the Lord has sent me — Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming — that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
44009018	Immediately scales seemed to fall from his eyes and he could see , and he arose and was baptized ,
44009019	and after taking food he regained his strength . Saul passed some days with the disciples who were in Damascus ,
44009020	and at once he began to proclaim in the synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God .
44009021	All who heard him were astonished and said , " Is not this the man who in Jerusalem persecuted those who call on this name , and who came here for the very purpose of binding and taking them to the high priests ? "
44009022	But Saul grew stronger and put to confusion the Jews who lived at Damascus , as he proved that this man was the Christ .
44009023	When a number of days had passed , the Jews plotted to put him out of the way ,
44009024	but this became known to Saul . They watched the gates day and night to seize him .
44009025	But the disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall , lowering him in a basket .
44009026	When Saul reached Jerusalem , he tried to attach himself to the disciples , but all were afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles , and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to him , and how courageously he had spoken in Damascus in the name of Jesus .
44009028	After that Saul was with them in Jerusalem , going out and in
44009029	and speaking freely in the name of the Lord . He frequently spoke and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews . But they kept trying to put him out of the way .
44009030	When the brethren learned of it , they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus .
44009031	So the church had peace throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and was built up , and advancing in the reverence of the Lord and by the encouragement of the Holy Spirit grew continually in numbers .
44009032	It happened that Peter , while passing about among all the holy , came down also to those who were dwelling at Lydda .
44009033	He found there a man named Aeneas who had been for eight years lying on a pallet , for he was a paralytic .
44009034	Peter said to him , " Aeneas , Jesus Christ is healing you . Rise up and make your bed . " Immediately he arose .
44009035	All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha . She abounded in good works and acts of kindness which she was accustomed to do .
44009037	It happened at that time that she fell sick and died . They bathed her and laid her out in an upper room .
44009038	Since Lydda was near to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent two men to him begging him , " Do not delay to come on down to us . "
44009039	Peter arose and went along with them . On his arrival they took him up to the room . All of the widows came around him wailing and showing the tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made while she was with them .
44009040	Peter sent them all out and kneeling down he prayed . Then turning to the body he said , " Tabitha , rise . " She opened her eyes , and seeing Peter she sat up .
44009041	Giving her his hand he raised her to her feet . Then calling the holy and the widows he presented her to them alive .
44009042	This became known through all Joppa and many believed in the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon , a tanner .
44010001	THERE was in Caesarea a man named Cornelius , a centurion in the battalion called the Italian cohort .
44010002	He was a pious man , reverencing God with all his household , doing many acts of charity to the people and praying to God constantly .
44010003	About three o'clock one afternoon he saw plainly in a vision an angel come in and say to him , " Cornelius . "
44010004	He gazed at him in alarm and asked , " What is it , my Lord ? " The angel said to him , " Your prayers and your gifts of charity have come up as an evidence before God .
44010005	Now send men to Joppa and ask for a man named Simon , who is called Peter .
44010006	He is the guest of a certain Simon , a tanner , whose house is by the seaside . "
44010007	When the angel who had been speaking to him had gone , Cornelius called two of his servants and a pious soldier of those who were attached to him ,
44010008	and , after explaining everything to them , sent them to Joppa .
44010009	On the next day , while they were on the road and approaching the city , Peter went up on the housetop to pray . It was about noon .
44010010	He began to feel hungry and wished to eat . While they were preparing food , he fell into a trance
44010011	and saw the heavens opened and something descending like a great sheet being let down to the ground by the four corners .
44010012	In it were all kinds of fourfooted animals and reptiles and birds of the air .
44010013	Then a voice came to him , " Rise , Peter , kill and eat . "
44010014	But Peter said , " By no means , Lord , for I have never eaten anything unclean or impure . "
44010015	A second time the voice came to him , " What God has cleansed you must not think unclean . "
44010016	This happened a third time , and then immediately the sheet was taken up into the heavens .
44010017	Peter was thinking this over and was at a loss what the vision meant . Just then the men who had been sent by Cornelius , after inquiring for the house of Simon , came to the door
44010018	and called to know whether Simon called Peter was a guest there .
44010019	While Peter was debating with himself about the vision , the Spirit said , " Here are two men looking for you .
44010020	Rise and go down and go with them without misgivings , for I have sent them . "
44010021	Peter went down and said to the men , " Here I am — the man you are looking for . What is the reason for your coming ? "
44010022	They said , " Cornelius , a centurion , an upright and God-fearing man , well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation , was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house , and to listen to your words . "
44010023	Then he invited them in and entertained them . The next day Peter arose and went away with them , and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	On the following day they came to Caesarea . Cornelius was expecting them and had assembled his relatives and his close friends .
44010025	As Peter was about to enter , Cornelius met him and falling at his feet did him reverence .
44010026	But Peter lifted him up , saying , " Stand up ; I myself also am a man . "
44010027	Conversing with him Peter entered the house and found many people assembled .
44010028	He said to them , " You understand that it is against our Law for a Jew to be closely associated with a Gentile or to visit him . But God has taught me not to call any person common or unclean .
44010029	Therefore when I was sent for I came without making any objection . So now I ask , For what reason have you sent for me ? "
44010030	Cornelius said , " Four days ago , at this hour , I was offering the three o'clock prayer in my house , when suddenly a man stood before me in shining dress
44010031	and said , ' Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your gifts of charity have been remembered before God .
44010032	Send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter . He is a guest in the house of Simon a tanner near the sea '
44010033	Immediately I sent to you and you have done well in coming . Now here we all are in God's presence to hear all that the Lord has commanded you . "
44010034	Peter opened his mouth and said , " Truly I understand that God is not partial ,
44010035	but in every nation whoever reverences him and lives righteously is acceptable to him .
44010036	As to the message which he sent to the children of Israel telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ — who is Lord of all —
44010037	you know the story that spread through all Judaea . It began in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed .
44010038	You know of Jesus of Nazareth , how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power . He went about doing good and healing all who were harassed by the Devil , for God was with him .
44010039	We are witnesses of all that he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem . They hung him on a cross and so killed him .
44010040	But God raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible ,
44010041	not to all the people , but to witnesses previously chosen by God , namely , to us who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead .
44010042	God commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that he is the divinely appointed Judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	All of the prophets testify to this , that every one who believes in him obtains forgiveness of sins through his name . "
44010044	While Peter was speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to his message .
44010045	All the believers who were of the circumcision who had come along with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles ,
44010046	for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God . Then Peter said ,
44010047	" Can any one forbid water for the baptism of these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did ? "
44010048	And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to remain there a few days .
44011001	THE apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the message of God .
44011002	When Peter went up to Jerusalem , those who were of the circumcision criticized him ,
44011003	saying , " You went into the houses of uncircumcised men and ate with them . "
44011004	But Peter began and explained consecutively all that had happened . He said ,
44011005	" I was in the city of Joppa and was praying , and in a trance I saw a vision . Something like a great sheet was descending , lowered from heaven by the four corners , and it came to where I was .
44011006	I looked at it attentively and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air .
44011007	Then I heard a voice saying to me , ' Rise , Peter , kill and eat . '
44011008	I said , ' By no means , Lord , for never has anything common or unclean entered my mouth . '
44011009	The voice spoke again from heaven , ' What God has cleansed you must not think common . '
44011010	This happened three times and then everything was drawn up again into heaven .
44011011	Immediately three men came to the house in which we were . They had been sent from Caesarea to me .
44011012	The Spirit directed me to go with them without any questioning . These six brethren also went with me , and we entered the man's house .
44011013	He related to us how he had seen in his house an angel who stood and said , ' Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter .
44011014	He will speak to you words by which you and your whole household will be saved . '
44011015	When I began speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them , just as on us at the beginning ,
44011016	and I remembered the words of the Lord how he said , ' John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . '
44011017	If then God gave to them the same gift that he gave to us on believing in the Lord Jesus , who was I that I could oppose God ? "
44011018	On hearing this they ceased their criticism and gave glory to God , saying , " Then even to the Gentiles God has granted the change of heart that leads to life . "
44011019	Those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch , telling the message to none but Jews .
44011020	Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene , and they on reaching Antioch spoke also to the Greeks , telling them the good news of the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The hand of the Lord was with them , and a large number believed and turned to the Lord .
44011022	Word came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem regarding these men , and they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived and saw the grace of God he was delighted , and he encouraged all to be firmly faithful to the Lord .
44011024	For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith . A considerable number were added to the Lord .
44011025	Barnabas went away to Tarsus to look up Saul ,
44011026	and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch . For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large company , and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called " Christians . "
44011027	In those days some prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them named Agabus arose and foretold through the Holy Spirit that a great famine was going to occur over all the inhabited world .
44011029	Then the disciples determined , each according to his means , to send something for the help of the brethren who were living in Judaea .
44011030	This they did , sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	ABOUT that time King Herod laid hands on some members of the church in order to maltreat them .
44012002	He killed James the brother of John with the sword .
44012003	Seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews , he proceeded to arrest Peter also . This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread .
44012004	He seized him and put him in prison , committing him to four guards of four soldiers each for safe keeping , intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover .
44012005	So Peter was under guard in the prison . But prayer was continually made by the church to God for him .
44012006	On the very night before Herod was going to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains , and guards before the door were watching the prison .
44012007	Suddenly an angel of the Lord was there . Light shone in the cell . Striking Peter's side he woke him , saying , " Rise up quickly . " His chains fell off his hands .
44012008	The angel said to him , " Put on your belt and your sandals . " Peter did so . The angel said to him , " Throw your cloak around you and follow me . "
44012009	Peter came out and followed along , not knowing whether what the angel was doing was real . He thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	After passing the first guard and the second , they came to the iron gate that leads into the city . This opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went along one street . Then suddenly the angel left him .
44012011	When Peter came to himself , he said , " Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hands of Herod , and from all the expectation of the Jewish people . "
44012012	So understanding the situation , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John called Mark , where a number were assembled and were praying .
44012013	When Peter knocked at the door of the entry , a girl named Rhoda came to listen ,
44012014	and when she recognized Peter's voice , without opening the door , she ran for joy and told them that Peter was standing at the door .
44012015	They said to her , " You are insane . " But she was positive that it was so . They said , " It is his angel . "
44012016	Peter continued knocking . When they opened the door and saw him they were amazed .
44012017	He motioned to them with his hand to be silent , and explained to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison , and he said , " Tell this to James and the brethren . " Then he left and went to a different place .
44012018	When day came there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter .
44012019	Herod searched for him , but not finding him he closely questioned the guards and ordered them to be led away to execution . Then he went down from Jerusalem to Caesarea and stayed there .
44012020	Herod had a bitter feud with the Tyrians and Sidonians . But they came to him with one mind , and having won over Blastus , the King's chamberlain , they begged for peace , because their country depended for its food supply on the King's country .
44012021	On an appointed day Herod in his royal robes sat on a platform and made an address to them .
44012022	The people shouted , " It is a god's voice , not a man's . "
44012023	Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him , because he did not give the glory to God , and he was eaten by worms and expired .
44012024	But God's message grew and spread .
44012025	Barnabas and Saul after fulfilling their mission returned from Jerusalem , bringing along with them John , surnamed Mark .
44013001	THERE were in Antioch among the members of the church several prophets and teachers — Barnabas , and Symeon , who was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen and Saul .
44013002	As they were serving the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , " Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them . "
44013003	Then , after fasting and praying and laying their hands upon them , they sent them off .
44013004	Sent out in this way by the Holy Spirit , Barnabas and Saul went down to Seleucia and from there sailed for Cyprus .
44013005	Arriving at Salamis they announced God's message in the synagogues of the Jews . They had John as their assistant .
44013006	After passing through the whole island as far as Paphos , they came across a Jewish magician and false prophet , named Bar-Jesus ,
44013007	who was in the company of the Proconsul , Sergius Paulus , an intelligent man . The Proconsul invited in Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message .
44013008	But Elymas the magician opposed them , endeavoring to turn the Proconsul away from the faith .
44013009	But Saul , full of the Holy Spirit , fixed his eyes on him
44013010	and said , " You who are full of every kind of fraud , you son of the Devil , you enemy of all righteousness , will you never stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord ?
44013011	And now the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind for a time , unable to see the sun . " Immediately a dimness and darkness fell on him , and he went about seeking for people to lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then the Proconsul , seeing what had happened , believed , being amazed at the teaching of the Lord .
44013013	Sailing away from Paphos , Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia . John left them there and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	But they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia . On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets , the synagogue directors sent to them saying , " Brethren , if you have any word of encouragement for the people , speak it . "
44013016	Paul rose and motioning with his hand said , " Israelites and you who reverence God , listen .
44013017	The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their sojourn in the land of Egypt , and with an uplifted arm brought them out .
44013018	For a period of about forty years he fed them in the wilderness ,
44013019	and after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years .
44013020	After that he gave them judges down to the prophet Samuel .
44013021	Next they asked for a king and God gave them Saul the son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44013022	After removing him , God raised up David to be their king , to whom he bore testimony , ' I have found David the son of Jesse , a man after my own heart . He will carry out all my purposes . '
44013023	" Of this man's descendants God , according to his promise , brought to Israel a savior — Jesus ,
44013024	before whose coming John had proclaimed to all the people of Israel baptism for a change of heart .
44013025	As John was finishing his career he used to say , ' What do you think that I am ? I am not he . But one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to unfasten . '
44013026	" Brethren , sons of Abraham's race and those among you who reverence God , the message of this salvation has been sent to you .
44013027	For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers , neither understanding him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , fulfilled those utterances by condemning him .
44013028	Although they found no ground for putting him to death they begged Pilate to have him killed .
44013029	When they had completely done all that had been predicted about him , they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from the dead
44013031	and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem . They are now his witnesses to all the people .
44013032	" We tell you the good news that the promise to our fathers has been kept ;
44013033	for God has fulfilled it for our children in raising up Jesus , as it is written in the second psalm , ' Thou art my son ; to-day I have become thy father . '
44013034	And as to his raising him from the dead , never to return to decay , he spoke thus ; ' I will give you the holy and sure promises made to David . '
44013035	Therefore he says also in another psalm , ' Thou wilt not let thy holy one see decay . '
44013036	For David after serving the will of God in his own generation fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay .
44013037	But he whom God raised up saw no decay .
44013038	" Therefore let it be known to you , brethren , that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you .
44013039	Yes , every one who believes in him is cleared from all the sins from which you could not be cleared by the Law of Moses .
44013040	Take care then that what was said in the Prophets does not come on you ,
44013041	' See , you disdainful ones , and wonder and perish ; for I am working a work in your days — a work which you will not believe even if some one fully explains it to you . ' "
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas were going out , the people begged that these words might be spoken to them on the next Sabbath .
44013043	After the synagogue was dismissed , many of the Jews and of the pious converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas , who talked to them and endeavored to persuade them to hold fast to the grace of God .
44013044	On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the message of God .
44013045	But the Jews , seeing the crowds , were filled with anger and kept speaking in abusive language against what was said by Paul .
44013046	Then Paul and Barnabas said with fearless plainness , " The message of God had to be spoken first to you . But since you thrust it away and do not judge yourselves worthy of life eternal — now , we turn to the Gentiles .
44013047	For so the Lord has commanded us , ' I have set you for a light of the Gentiles , that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth . '
44013048	When the Gentiles heard this , they rejoiced and glorified the message of the Lord , and all who were predestined to life eternal believed .
44013049	The message of the Lord was carried abroad through the whole country .
44013050	But the Jews stirred up the pious women of high standing and the leading men of the city , and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their boundaries .
44013051	They shook off the dust of their feet as a protest against them , and came to Iconium .
44013052	The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	IN Iconium Paul and Barnabas went in the same way into the synagogue and spoke so that a large number both of Jews and of Greeks believed .
44014002	But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren .
44014003	Therefore the apostles spent considerable time speaking freely and fearlessly in reliance upon the Lord , who bore witness to his gracious message by permitting signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
44014004	The people of the city became divided ; some were with the Jews and some with the apostles .
44014005	But when there was a rush made by the Gentiles and the Jews , along with their rulers , to hustle them and stone them ,
44014006	the apostles learned of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia , Lystra and Derbe , and the surrounding country ,
44014007	and there they went on telling the good news .
44014008	In Lystra there was a man sitting who was powerless in his feet . He had been lame from his mother's womb and never had walked .
44014009	He was listening to Paul as he was speaking . Paul fixed his eyes on him , and , seeing that he had faith to be healed ,
44014010	said in a loud voice , " Stand up straight on your feet . " He sprang up and walked about .
44014011	When the crowds saw what Paul had done , they raised their voices , saying in Lycaonian , " The gods have taken human form and come down to us . "
44014012	They called Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes , because he was the principal speaker .
44014013	Then the priest of Zeus , whose temple was in front of the city , brought bulls and garlands to the gates , followed by the crowds , and intended to offer sacrifice .
44014014	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it , they rent their garments and sprang into the crowd , crying out ,
44014015	" Men , why are you doing this ? We too are men with the same weaknesses that you have . We are bringing you the good news that you are to turn from these foolish things to the living God , who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them .
44014016	In past generations he permitted all the nations to go their own ways ,
44014017	though he did not leave himself without evidence , for he did you good and gave rains from heaven and fruitful seasons , filling your hearts with food and gladness . "
44014018	Even by saying this they with difficulty kept the crowds from offering sacrifice to them .
44014019	But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds , and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside of the city , thinking that he was dead .
44014020	But when the disciples gathered around him he rose up and reentered the city . On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe .
44014021	Telling the good news in that city they made a number of disciples . Then they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch ,
44014022	reassuring the minds of the disciples and encouraging them to be steadfast in the faith , saying , " Through many trials we must enter into the kingdom of God . "
44014023	They appointed elders for them in every church , and after prayer and fasting committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed .
44014024	They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia .
44014025	After telling the message in Perga , they came down to Attalia .
44014026	From there they sailed for Antioch , where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed .
44014027	Upon their arrival they assembled the church and narrated all that God , working with them , had done , and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	There they passed no little time with the disciples .
44015001	BUT certain men came down from Judaea and undertook to teach the brethren , " Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved . "
44015002	Since no little dissension and controversy arose between Paul and Barnabas and these men , it was arranged that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question .
44015003	So they were sent on by the church and passed through Phoenicia and Samaria , relating the conversion of the Gentiles , which caused great joy to all the brethren .
44015004	On their arrival in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders , and they narrated all that God , working with them , had done .
44015005	Then some of the party of the Pharisees , who had become believers , rose and said , " We must circumcise them and tell them to keep the Law of Moses . "
44015006	The apostles and elders met to confer about this matter .
44015007	After there had been much debate , Peter rose and said to them , " Brethren , you know that in early days God chose among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of good news and should believe .
44015008	And God , who knows all hearts , bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit , just as he did to us .
44015009	He made no difference between us and them in cleansing their hearts by faith .
44015010	Now , therefore , why are you testing God by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear ?
44015011	On the contrary we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they are . "
44015012	The whole assembly remained silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles .
44015013	When they ceased speaking , James said , " Brethren , listen to me .
44015014	Symeon has told how first God graciously visited the Gentiles and took a people for his name .
44015015	With this the words of the prophets agree , as it is written ,
44015016	' After this I will return and build up again the tent of David which has fallen down ; yes , I will build up its ruins and erect it again ,
44015017	that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord , even all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been bestowed , says the Lord
44015018	who does these things foreknown from of old . '
44015019	Therefore I judge best not to trouble those of the Gentiles who have turned to God ,
44015020	but to write to them to abstain from contamination with idols , and from unchastity , and from what has been strangled , and from blood .
44015021	For Moses has had for generations past in every city those who preach him , for he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath . "
44015022	Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders , with the whole church , to select men from themselves and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; namely , Judas called Barsabbas , and Silas , men esteemed among the brethren .
44015023	They wrote and sent by their hands the following letter : " The Apostles and the Brethren who are elders , to the Brethren from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia : Greeting .
44015024	" Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons from us have troubled you with words , unsettling your minds , — men whom we did not authorize , —
44015025	it seemed good , after unanimous agreement , to select some men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44015026	who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who will tell you orally the same things .
44015028	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no further burden than these necessary things :
44015029	to abstain from things sacrificed to idols , and from blood , and from strangled things , and from unchastity . If you keep yourselves from these you will do well . Farewell . "
44015030	So they were sent away and went down to Antioch , where they called together the whole body and delivered over the letter .
44015031	On reading it they rejoiced over the encouragement .
44015032	Both Judas and Silas , being themselves prophets , encouraged and confirmed the brethren by long addresses .
44015033	After spending some time they were sent away with a message of peace from the brethren to those who had sent them .
44015035	Paul and Barnabas stayed on in Antioch teaching and telling , in association with many others , the good news of the Lord's message .
44015036	After some time Paul said to Barnabas , " Let us go back and visit the brethren in every city in which we made known the Lord's message , and see how they are prospering . "
44015037	Barnabas wished to take along John who was called Mark .
44015038	But Paul did not approve of taking him along , since he had left them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them into the work .
44015039	Such a difference of feeling resulted that they separated from each other . Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus .
44015040	Paul selected Silas and left , after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brethren .
44015041	They went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches .
44016001	THEY came to Derbe and Lystra . At Lystra there was a disciple named Timothy , the son of a Jewish woman , who was a believer , and of a Greek father .
44016002	He had a good reputation among the brethren in Lystra and Iconium .
44016003	Paul wished to have Timothy go with him . So he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts . For they all knew that his father was a Greek .
44016004	Thus they traveled through the cities and delivered to the disciples for observance the rules that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem .
44016005	So the churches grew firmer in faith and increased in numbers from day to day .
44016006	They went through Phrygia and the Galatian country , the Holy Spirit having prevented their speaking the message in Asia .
44016007	Upon reaching Mysia they attempted to go into Bithynia , but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them .
44016008	Passing by Mysia they came down to Troas .
44016009	There a vision appeared to Paul in the night — a Macedonian man was standing and begging him saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us . "
44016010	After Paul had seen the vision , we at once tried to go out to Macedonia , inferring that God had called on us to tell the good news to the people there .
44016011	Sailing away from Troas we made a straight run to Samothrace , and on the next day to Neapolis .
44016012	From there we went to Philippi , which is the first city of that part of Macedonia and is a Roman colony . We remained in that city for a number of days .
44016013	On the Sabbath day we went outside of the gate to a place on the riverside where it was customary to go for prayer , and we sat down and talked with the women who had gathered there .
44016014	One woman named Lydia , a dealer in purple , from the city of Thyatira , who reverenced God , was listening . God opened her heart to receive what was said by Paul .
44016015	When she had been baptized along with her household , she begged us , " If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house and stay , " and she insisted on our doing so .
44016016	It so happened that as we were going to the place of prayer a certain slave girl who had a spirit of divination met us . She was bringing great gain to her masters by divining .
44016017	She followed Paul and us and kept calling out , " These men are servants of God Most High , and they are teaching you the way of salvation . "
44016018	This she kept doing for many days . Paul was annoyed , and turning he said to the spirit , " I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her , " and it came out at that very moment .
44016019	When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the public square before the authorities .
44016020	Bringing them in , they said to the magistrates , " These men , who are Jews , are disturbing our city
44016021	and teaching customs which it is not proper for us , who are Romans , to receive or practice . "
44016022	The crowd joined in the attack upon them , and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods .
44016023	After laying many stripes upon them they cast them into prison , ordering the jailer to keep them securely .
44016024	He on receiving such an order thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet secure in the stocks .
44016025	But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the other prisoners were listening .
44016026	Suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken . Immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were loosed .
44016027	The jailer , waking from sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , thinking that the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul said with a loud voice , " Do no harm to yourself , for we are all here . "
44016029	Calling for a light he sprang in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas ,
44016030	and led them out and said , " Men , what must I do to be saved ? "
44016031	They said , " Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved , and your household , "
44016032	and they told the message of God to him and to all who were in his house .
44016033	He took them at that hour of the night and washed their stripes . Then he was baptized , he and all of his household , immediately .
44016034	He brought them into his house and spread the table for them , and rejoiced with his whole family because he had believed in God .
44016035	When morning came the magistrates sent their orderlies to say , " Set those men at liberty . "
44016036	The jailer told this order to Paul , " The magistrates have sent to have you set at liberty . Now go out and proceed on your journey in peace . "
44016037	But Paul said to them , " After beating us publicly and without a trial , although we are Romans , they cast us into prison . And are they now sending us out secretly ? No , let them come themselves and lead us out . "
44016038	The orderlies reported these words to the magistrates . When they heard that they were Romans they were alarmed ,
44016039	and came and begged them , and after leading them out requested them to leave the city .
44016040	They came out of the prison and went into Lydia's house , and after seeing and encouraging the brethren they departed .
44017001	AFTER passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica . Here there was a synagogue of the Jews .
44017002	According to Paul's custom he went in to meet with them , and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
44017003	explaining and showing that it was necessary that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead , and saying , " Jesus of whom I am telling you is the Christ . "
44017004	Some of them were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas — a large number of the pious Greeks and not a few of the leading women .
44017005	But the Jews became excited and , taking with them some of the base loafers from the market-place , they made a mob and threw the city into confusion . They attacked the house of Jason and tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people .
44017006	Not finding them , they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the magistrates , shouting , " These men who have upset the world have now come here .
44017007	Jason has received them . They all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is a different king — Jesus . "
44017008	Both the crowd and the magistrates were disturbed on hearing this .
44017009	So they took security from Jason and the rest and then dismissed them .
44017010	The brethren immediately sent off Paul and Silas in the night to Beraea . They on arrival went into the synagogue of the Jews .
44017011	These people were nobler than those in Thessalonica . They welcomed the message with all readiness and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so .
44017012	Consequently many of them believed , and also not a few Greeks ; women of high standing and men .
44017013	When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul also in Beraea , they came there agitating and disturbing the crowds .
44017014	At once then the brethren sent away Paul to go down to the sea coast . Silas and Timothy remained there .
44017015	Those who were conducting Paul took him as far as Athens , and , after receiving a letter to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible , they left .
44017016	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens , his spirit was stirred within him as he looked upon the city full of idols .
44017017	He often debated in the synagogue with the Jews and pious persons , and in the market-place every day with whoever happened to be there .
44017018	Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him , and some said , " What can this idle talker mean ? " Others said , " He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods , " because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	They took him and led him up on to the Areopagus , saying , " May we know what this new doctrine that you are speaking of is ?
44017020	For you are bringing strange and surprising things to our ears . We wish to know what these things are . "
44017021	For all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing else than in telling or hearing something newer than the last .
44017022	Paul took his stand in the midst of the Areopagus and said : " Men of Athens , I see that you are in every way unusually reverential to the gods .
44017023	For in passing about and contemplating your sacred objects I came upon an altar on which was inscribed , ' To an unknown God . ' What you are worshiping in ignorance — that I am making known to you .
44017024	" The God who made the world and all the things that are in it , he who is Lord of heaven and earth , does not dwell in temples made by hands ,
44017025	nor is he served by human hands , as if he needed anything . For he gives to all life and breath and all things .
44017026	And he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth , having marked out the appointed times and the boundaries of their abodes ,
44017027	that they might seek for God , if they could feel after him and find him , though , indeed , he is not far from each one of us .
44017028	For in him we live and move and are ; as some of your own poets have said , ' For we also are his offspring . '
44017029	Being then the offspring of God , we ought not to think that deity is like gold or silver or stone , a thing carved by man's art and thought .
44017030	The times of ignorance God overlooked , but now he commands all men everywhere to change ,
44017031	since he has set a day in which he will soon judge the world in justice by the man whom he has appointed , and of whom he has given evidence to all men by raising him from the dead . "
44017032	When they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some sneered ; others said , " We will hear you again about this . "
44017033	So Paul went out from the midst of them .
44017034	But certain men attached themselves to him and believed . Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite , and there was a woman named Damaris and several other persons .
44018001	AFTER this Paul left Athens and came to Corinth .
44018002	There he found a Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus but recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife , because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome . Paul visited these people ,
44018003	and because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together ; for by trade they were tent-makers .
44018004	But in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks .
44018005	When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul was absorbed by the message , bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
44018006	When they resisted and spoke profane words , he rent his garments and said to them , " Your blood is on your own heads . I am clear , and from now on I am going to the Gentiles . "
44018007	So he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus , who reverenced God . His house was next to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus , the synagogue Director , believed in the Lord with all his household , and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized .
44018009	The Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul , " Do not fear , but speak and be not silent ,
44018010	for I am with you and no one shall attack and harm you , for I have many people in this city . "
44018011	So he stayed a year and six months , teaching among them the message of God .
44018012	While Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia , the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court ,
44018013	saying , " This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law . "
44018014	As Paul was about to open his mouth , Gallio said to the Jews , " If it was some crime or wicked knavery , O you Jews , I would have reasonable patience with you .
44018015	But if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law , see to it yourselves . I will not be a judge of these things , "
44018016	and he drove them from before the judge's seat .
44018017	Then they laid hold of Sosthenes , the synagogue Director , and beat him right in front of the judge's seat . But Gallio cared for none of these things .
44018018	Paul remained a number of days more . Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria , and Priscilla and Aquila went with him . He had shaved his head at Cenchreae , for he had a vow .
44018019	They came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there . He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews .
44018020	Although they begged him to stay longer , he did not consent ,
44018021	but took his leave , saying , " I will return to you again , God willing . "
44018022	From Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea . Then he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church , and from there returned to Antioch .
44018023	After spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia , place by place , strengthening all the disciples .
44018024	A certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by birth , a learned man , had come to Ephesus .
44018025	He was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord , and , being very earnest in spirit , was teaching accurately about Jesus , although he knew no baptism but John's .
44018026	This man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue . When Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still .
44018027	As he wished to cross over to Achaia , the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him . So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace .
44018028	For he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews , showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ .
44019001	WHILE Apollos was in Corinth , Paul , after passing through the upper country , came to Ephesus and found certain disciples .
44019002	He said to them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? " They said to him , " On the contrary , we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit . "
44019003	He said , " How then were you baptized ? " They said , " With John's baptism . "
44019004	Paul said , " John baptized with the baptism of a change of heart , telling the people to believe in one who was coming after him , that is , in Jesus . "
44019005	On hearing that , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus ,
44019006	and when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied .
44019007	There were about twelve of these men in all .
44019008	For three months Paul went into the synagogue and spoke fearlessly , arguing persuasively regarding the kingdom of God .
44019009	When some were hardened and would not believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation , he departed from them and took away his disciples and discussed daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This went on for two years , so that all the inhabitants of Asia , both Jews and Greeks , heard the message of the Lord .
44019011	Through the hands of Paul , God did miracles of no ordinary kind ,
44019012	so that handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick , and the diseases left them and the evil spirits departed .
44019013	Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , " I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims . "
44019014	There were seven sons of a certain Sceva , a Jewish high priest , who did this .
44019015	But the evil spirit answered them , " Jesus I know and Paul I know ; but who are you ? "
44019016	and the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on them and overpowered both of them , and so belabored them that they fled from that house naked and wounded .
44019017	This became known to all who were living in Ephesus , both Jews and Greeks , and awe fell on all of them , and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor .
44019018	Many of those who had become believers came confessing and telling of their practices .
44019019	A number of those who had practiced magic brought their books and burned them before all . Adding up the prices of them they found the total to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
44019020	Thus vigorously the Lord's message grew and strengthened .
44019021	When these things had been accomplished Paul took it in mind to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there I must see Rome also . "
44019022	He sent on into Macedonia two of his assistants , Timothy and Erastus , but he himself remained awhile in Asia .
44019023	At that time there arose no small commotion about the Way .
44019024	For a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , a maker of silver shrines of Artemis , was bringing to the artisans no small gain .
44019025	He gathered these and the workmen employed about such things and said , " Men , you know that from this business we get our wealth ,
44019026	and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus , but also throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a large number , saying that hand-made gods are not gods at all .
44019027	Not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming into disrepute , but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is in danger of being held of no account , and she whom now all Asia and the wide world worship will be deposed from her majesty . "
44019028	Upon hearing this , they became full of anger and shouted , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
44019029	The city was filled with confusion , and the people rushed with one mind into the theater , having gotten hold of Gaius and Aristarchus , fellow travelers of Paul's .
44019030	When Paul wished to go in and face the people the disciples would not let him .
44019031	Some of the city officials who were his friends sent to him and begged him not to expose himself in the theater .
44019032	Some were shouting one thing and some another , for the assembly was in confusion , and the most did not know why they had come together .
44019033	Some of the crowd fixed on Alexander , since the Jews were putting him forward . And Alexander motioned with his hand and wished to make a defense before the people .
44019034	But when they recognized that he was a Jew , there arose one shout from all for about two hours , " Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! "
44019035	Then the City Clerk quieted the crowd and said , " Men of Ephesus , who is there of all men who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the temple-keeper of the great Artemis , and of her image which fell down from Zeus ?
44019036	Since these things are indisputable , you ought to be calm and do nothing rash .
44019037	For you have brought here these men who are not robbers of temples nor defamers of your goddess .
44019038	If Demetrius and the artisans with him have a charge against any one , there are court days and there are proconsuls ; let the parties state their cases .
44019039	If you are seeking anything further , it shall be settled in a lawful assembly .
44019040	For we are in danger of being called in question regarding to-day's mob , and we shall not be able to give a reason for this tumult . "
44019041	By saying this he dissolved the gathering .
44020001	WHEN the uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples , and , after encouraging them , he bade them farewell and left to proceed to Macedonia .
44020002	Passing through those parts and encouraging them by many addresses , he came into Greece .
44020003	There he spent three months . When a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria , he decided to return through Macedonia .
44020004	There were in company with him Sopater of Beraea , the son of Pyrrhus , and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus , and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy , and from Asia Tychicus and Trophimus .
44020005	These went on and were waiting for us in Troas .
44020006	After the Days of Unleavened Bread we sailed from Philippi and came to them in Troas in five days . There we spent seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week , when we all were assembled to break bread , Paul was discoursing to them , being about to leave in the morning , and he extended his address until midnight .
44020008	There were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled .
44020009	A certain young man named Eutychus , sitting in a window , was overcome with deep sleep while Paul went on discoursing . At last overpowered by sleep he fell from the third story and was taken up dead .
44020010	But Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him and said , " Do not make a noisy wailing ; for his life is still in him . "
44020011	Then he went up and broke bread and ate and talked on till daybreak and so departed .
44020012	They brought the boy living , and were not a little comforted .
44020013	We went in advance to the ship and sailed for Assos , intending to take on Paul there , for so he had arranged , intending to come himself by land .
44020014	So when he joined us at Assos , we took him aboard and came to Mitylene .
44020015	From there we sailed next day and arrived off Chios . The next day we came to Samos , and on the following day to Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia . He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem , if possible , on the Day of Pentecost .
44020017	From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church .
44020018	When they came to him , he said to them , " You know how I have lived among you the whole time since the first day I set foot in Asia ,
44020019	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews —
44020020	how I did not shrink from telling you anything that was profitable or from teaching you publicly and from house to house ,
44020021	urging upon both Jews and Greeks the need of a change of heart toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus .
44020022	" And now I am on my way , bound in spirit , to Jerusalem , not knowing what is to befall me there ,
44020023	except that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city that chains and trials are waiting for me .
44020024	But I do not hold my life as of any account if only I may finish my race and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus , to testify to the good news of the grace of God .
44020025	And now I know that you all , among whom I have gone about heralding the kingdom , will never see my face again .
44020026	Therefore I testify to you to-day that I am clear of the blood of all .
44020027	For I did not shrink from telling you the whole purpose of God .
44020028	" Be watchful of yourselves and of all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers . Shepherd the church of God which he bought with his own blood .
44020029	I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you , not sparing the flock .
44020030	And from among yourselves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves .
44020031	Therefore watch , remembering that for three years I never ceased night nor day to exhort each one of you with tears .
44020032	" And now I commit you to the Lord and to his gracious message , which can build you up and give you the heritage among all those who have been made holy .
44020033	I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel .
44020034	You yourselves know that these hands provided for my needs and the needs of my companions .
44020035	In all things I showed you that so laboring we ought to help the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that he said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive . '
44020036	After saying this he kneeled with them all and prayed .
44020037	All wept aloud , and falling on Paul's neck they kissed him affectionately ,
44020038	grieving especially because he had said that they would never see his face again ; and they escorted him to the ship .
44021001	WHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and had sailed , we made a straight run to Cos , then on the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara .
44021002	There finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia we went on board and sailed .
44021003	After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left , we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre ; for there the ship was to discharge her cargo .
44021004	We looked up the disciples and stayed with them seven days . They repeatedly told Paul through the Holy Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021005	But when we had finished the days , we left and continued our journey , and they all with their wives and children escorted us until we got outside of the city . Then , after kneeling down on the beach and praying ,
44021006	we tore ourselves from one another ; we went aboard the ship and they went back to their homes .
44021007	We made the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais . There we greeted the brethren and remained one day with them .
44021008	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea , and entered the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the Seven , and we stayed with him .
44021009	Philip had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy .
44021010	During our stay of many days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Jerusalem .
44021011	He came to see us , and took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said , " Thus says the Holy Spirit , ' So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt , and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles . ' "
44021012	When we heard this , both we and the residents there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Paul answered , " What are you accomplishing by weeping and breaking my heart ? For I hold myself ready not only to be bound , but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . "
44021014	When he would not be persuaded , we stopped talking , saying , " The Lord's will be done . "
44021015	At the end of these days we packed up and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea went up with us , taking along Mnason , a Cypriote , an old-time disciple , whose guests we were to be .
44021017	When we reached Jerusalem , the brethren welcomed us cordially .
44021018	On the next day , Paul went in with us for an interview with James , and all the elders came .
44021019	After saluting them , he related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his service .
44021020	After hearing him , they gave glory to God and said to Paul , " You see , brother , how many tens of thousands of believers there are among the Jews , and they are all zealous for the Law .
44021021	These have heard reports that you are teaching all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to break away from Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children and not to observe the customs .
44021022	What then ? It will be generally heard that you have come .
44021023	So do this that we tell you . There are among us four men who are under a vow .
44021024	Take these men and go through purification with them and pay their expenses , so that they may shave their heads . Then all will know that what they have heard about you amounts to nothing , but that you yourself walk in obedience to the Law .
44021025	" But as to the Gentiles that have believed , we have , after consideration , sent our decision that they shall guard themselves against what has been sacrificed to idols , and against blood , and against what has been strangled , and against unchastity . "
44021026	Then Paul on the next day took the men , and , after purifying himself , entered the Temple courts , giving notice of the completion of the days of purification — the time until a sacrifice would have been offered for each one of them .
44021027	But when the seven days were nearly completed , the Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple courts , and stirred up all the crowd and laid their hands on Paul ,
44021028	shouting , " Men of Israel , help . This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere against our people and the Law and this place , and moreover , he has brought Greeks into the Temple courts and has desecrated this holy place . "
44021029	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul , and they thought that he had brought him into the Temple courts .
44021030	The whole city was excited and the people rushed together . Seizing Paul , they drew him out of the Temple courts , and immediately the gates were closed .
44021031	As they were trying to kill him , word went up to the Tribune of the battalion that all Jerusalem was in commotion .
44021032	He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people . They , on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains , and inquired who he was and what he had done .
44021034	Some called out one thing and some another in the crowd . Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion , he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks .
44021035	When Paul got upon the stairs , it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the mob .
44021036	For the crowd of people was following and shouting , " Kill him ! "
44021037	As he was about to enter the barracks Paul said to the Tribune , " May I say something to you ? " He replied , " Can you speak Greek ?
44021038	Are you then not the Egyptian who some time ago raised a sedition and led off four thousand assassins into the desert ? "
44021039	Paul said , " I am a Jew from Tarsus , in Cilicia , a citizen of no insignificant city . I beg you to let me talk to the people . "
44021040	He gave him leave , and Paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people . There was a great silence , and , speaking loudly in Hebrew , Paul said :
44022001	" BRETHREN and Fathers , listen to the defense I now make to you . "
44022002	Hearing him speaking to them in the Hebrew language , they kept all the more quiet . He continued :
44022003	" I am a Jew , born in Tarsus , in Cilicia , but brought up in this city , educated at the feet of Gamaliel in exact knowledge of our ancestral Law , and I was zealous for God as you all are to-day .
44022004	I persecuted this Way to the death , binding and delivering into prison both men and women ,
44022005	as the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me . From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there .
44022006	It happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus , about noon , suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me .
44022007	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? '
44022008	I asked , ' Who is speaking ? ' He said to me , ' I am Jesus the Nazarene , whom you are persecuting . '
44022009	My companions saw the light , but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me .
44022010	I said , ' What shall I do , Lord ? ' The Lord said to me , ' Rise and go into Damascus , and there you will be told about all that it has been appointed for you to do . '
44022011	Since I could not see , owing to the brightness of that light , my companions led me by the hand , and so I entered Damascus .
44022012	" Then a man named Ananias , a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there ,
44022013	came to see me and stood by me and said , ' Brother Saul , receive your sight , ' and I , at that moment , could see him .
44022014	He said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth ,
44022015	for you shall be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	And now why delay ? Rise , be baptized and wash away your sins , calling upon his name . '
44022017	" After I had returned to Jerusalem , and was praying in the Temple courts , I fell into a trance
44022018	and saw Jesus saying to me , ' Hasten and depart quickly from Jerusalem , for they will not receive your testimony concerning me . '
44022019	But I said , ' Lord , they know that I used to imprison and beat from synagogue to synagogue those who believe in thee ,
44022020	and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed I myself was standing by and approving it , and taking care of the cloaks of those who were putting him to death . '
44022021	But he said to me , ' Go , for I will send you far away to Gentiles . '
44022022	They listened up to this point , but now they broke out , shouting , " Away with such a fellow from the earth ! He ought never to have lived ! "
44022023	While they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air ,
44022024	the Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash , so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him .
44022025	When they had tied him up with the thongs , Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by , " Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman , and without a trial ? "
44022026	On hearing that , the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him , " What are you going to do ? For this man is a Roman . "
44022027	Then the Tribune came to him and said , " Tell me ; are you a Roman ? " He said , " Yes . "
44022028	The Tribune said , " I obtained this citizenship by paying a great sum of money . " Paul said , " But I was born to it . "
44022029	At once those who were about to examine him went away from him , and the Tribune was alarmed when he learned that he was a Roman , because he had chained him .
44022030	On the next day , wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews , the Tribune loosed Paul and ordered the high priests and all the Council to assemble , and brought Paul down and stood him before them .
44023001	PAUL fixed his eyes on the Council and said , " Brethren , I have conducted myself with all good conscience toward God up to this day . "
44023002	The High Priest Ananias told those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , " God will soon strike you , you whitewashed wall . Are you sitting to judge me by the Law and yet violating the Law by ordering me to be struck ? "
44023004	Those who stood by said , " Are you insulting God's High Priest ? "
44023005	Paul said , " I did not know , brethren , that he was High Priest . It is written , ' Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people . ' "
44023006	Then Paul , perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees , shouted out in the Council , " Brethren , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees . I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead . "
44023007	On his saying this , a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees , and the assembly became divided .
44023008	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit , but the Pharisees confess both .
44023009	So a great uproar arose , and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended , saying , " We find nothing wrong in this man . What if a spirit has spoken to him , or an angel ? "
44023010	When the strife was becoming violent , the Tribune , fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them , ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks .
44023011	On the following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said , " Courage ! As you have witnessed for me in Jerusalem , so you must witness in Rome . "
44023012	When it was day , the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty who had taken this oath .
44023014	They came to the high priests and elders and said , " We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	Now therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you , as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him , and we , before he comes near , will be ready to put him out of the way . "
44023016	But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush , and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul .
44023017	Paul called to him one of the centurions and said , " Take this young man to the Tribune , for he has something to tell him . "
44023018	He took him and led him to the Tribune and said , " Paul , the prisoner , called me and asked me to bring this young man to you . He has something to say to you . "
44023019	The Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
44023020	He said , " The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to-morrow to the Council to inquire something more exactly about him .
44023021	But do not yield to them , for more than forty men of them are lying in ambush , and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him , and now they are ready , expecting a promise from you . "
44023022	The Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him ; " Tell no one that you have revealed this to me . "
44023023	Then calling to him two of the centurions he said , " Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea , and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen , at nine o'clock to-night . "
44023024	They were to provide animals for Paul to ride and take him safely to Felix the Governor .
44023025	He wrote a letter in the following form :
44023026	" Claudius Lysias to his Excellency , Governor Felix : greeting .
44023027	This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came up with soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman .
44023028	Wishing to find what was the charge that they had against him I took him down to their Council .
44023029	I found him accused regarding disputed questions of their law , but of nothing deserving of death or of bonds .
44023030	Information has come to me that there will be a plot against the man , and so I am sending him at once to you , and I have commanded his accusers to state their case against him before you . "
44023031	So the soldiers , according to their orders , took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris .
44023032	On the next day they let the horsemen go on with him , but they themselves returned to the barracks .
44023033	The horsemen came on to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor , and also placed Paul before him .
44023034	He read the letter and asked of what province he was , and learned that he was from Cilicia .
44023035	Then he said , " I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive . " He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle .
44024001	AFTER five days the High Priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an advocate named Tertullus , and they spoke against Paul to the Governor .
44024002	When Paul had been called in , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , " Because we enjoy great peace through your administration and reforms are taking place for this nation through your prudence ,
44024003	we accept it always and everywhere , most excellent Felix , with all gratitude .
44024004	But not to burden you further , I beg you in your fairness to hear us briefly .
44024005	We have found this man a pest and an inciter of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world , and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
44024006	He even tried to desecrate the Temple courts , but we overpowered him .
44024008	You yourself can examine him and learn from him as to all these things of which we are accusing him . "
44024009	The Jews joined in the attack upon him , affirming that these things were so .
44024010	Paul answered , when the Governor nodded to him to speak , " Because I know that for many years you have been a judge to this nation , I feel courage in defending myself .
44024011	You can ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship .
44024012	Neither did they find me discussing with any one in the Temple courts nor making any tumultuous gatherings in the synagogues nor anywhere in the city ,
44024013	nor can they bring you proofs of their accusations against me .
44024014	" This I do confess to you , that in the Way which they call a heresy I worship the God of our fathers , believing all things that are according to the Law and what is written in the Prophets
44024015	and having the hope in God which they themselves also accept — that there will be a resurrection both of the just and of the unjust .
44024016	And in this I take pains , to have always a clear conscience toward God and toward men .
44024017	" After many years I came to my nation to make gifts of charity and offerings .
44024018	They found me in the Temple thus occupied and purified , with no crowd or noise — but there were some Jews from Asia ,
44024019	who ought to have been here before you to present their accusations if they had anything against me ,
44024020	or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the Council ;
44024021	unless it was in the single assertion that I shouted as I stood among them , ' It is regarding the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial to-day before you ! ' "
44024022	Felix adjourned the case , since he was well informed regarding the Way , saying , " When Lysias the Tribune comes down , I will inquire into your matters . "
44024023	He gave orders to the Centurion to guard him , but to let him have indulgence , and not to hinder any of his friends from attending to his wants .
44024024	After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife , who was a Jewess , and sent for Paul and heard him regarding faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	While Paul was reasoning about righteousness and self-discipline and the judgment that is to come , Felix became alarmed and said , " Go for the present . When I find a convenient time I will send for you . "
44024026	At the same time he was in hopes that money would be given him by Paul and therefore he used to send for him more frequently and converse with him .
44024027	But at the end of two years Felix received Porcius Festus as a successor , and , wishing to do the Jews a favor , he left Paul in chains .
44025001	FESTUS entered the province and after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	There the high priests and the leaders of the Jews spoke to him against Paul
44025003	and begged as a favor that he would send for him to Jerusalem , intending to have an ambush and kill him on the road .
44025004	But Festus answered that Paul was being kept in Caesarea and that he himself was going back very soon .
44025005	" Let those of you who can , " he said , " go down with me , and , if there is anything wrong about the man , let them bring their charges against him . "
44025006	After spending not more than eight or ten days among them , he went down to Caesarea and on the next day took his seat on the judge's bench and ordered Paul to be brought in .
44025007	When he had come in , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges , which they were unable to prove ,
44025008	while Paul claimed in his own defense , " Neither against the Jewish Law nor against the Temple courts nor against Caesar , have I committed any wrong . "
44025009	Festus , wishing to gain favor with the Jews , asked Paul , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried for this before me ? "
44025010	Paul said , " I am standing before Caesar's bar , where I ought to be tried . I have not harmed any Jews in anything , as you very well know .
44025011	If I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death , I do not ask not to die . But if there is nothing in the accusations of these men , no one has the power to give me up to them . I appeal to Caesar . "
44025012	Then Festus , after talking with his council , answered , " You have appealed to Caesar ; to Caesar you shall go . "
44025013	When some days had passed , Agrippa the King and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus .
44025014	As they were spending a good many days there , Festus laid Paul's case before the King . " There is a man here , " he said , " who was left a prisoner by Felix ,
44025015	against whom when I was in Jerusalem the high priests and the elders of the Jews had much to say , asking to have him condemned .
44025016	I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge .
44025017	" So they came along down here and , without making any delay , on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in .
44025018	When his accusers arose , they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting ,
44025019	but they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive .
44025020	Being at a loss about a question of this kind , I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges .
44025021	But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor , I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar . "
44025022	Agrippa said to Festus , " I should like to hear the man myself . " " To-morrow , " he replied , " you shall hear him . "
44025023	So on the next day Agrippa came and Bernice with much display , and they entered the auditorium with the military tribunes and the principal men of the city , and at Festus ' command Paul was led in .
44025024	Festus said , " King Agrippa and all present here with us , you see this man against whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me , both in Jerusalem and here , crying out that he ought not to live any longer .
44025025	But I understood that he had done nothing worthy of death , and when he himself had appealed to the Emperor , I decided to send him .
44025026	Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord . Therefore I have brought him before you all , and especially before you , King Agrippa , that after an examination I may have something to write .
44025027	For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to specify the charges against him . "
44026001	AGRIPPA said to Paul , " You are at liberty to speak for yourself . " Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense :
44026002	" In regard to all of the things of which I am accused by Jews , King Agrippa , I consider myself fortunate that I am to make my defense to-day before you ,
44026003	since you are especially expert in all Jewish customs and questions . Therefore I pray you to hear me patiently .
44026004	" My life from boyhood , which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem , all Jews know .
44026005	They knew me from long ago , if they were willing to testify , and that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
44026006	And now I stand to be tried for the hope of the promise which God made to our fathers ,
44026007	to which our twelve tribes devotedly serving God night and day hope to attain . For this hope I am accused by the Jews , O King .
44026008	" Why do all of you consider it incredible if God raises dead men ?
44026009	I thought with myself that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazarene .
44026010	And I did it in Jerusalem and many holy men I shut up in prison , getting authority from the high priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
44026011	In all the synagogues and often I punished them and compelled them to say profane words . Being excessively mad against them , I pursued them even to foreign cities .
44026012	" Thus engaged , as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the high priests ,
44026013	about midday , on the road , I saw , O King , a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven around me and my companions .
44026014	We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? It is hard for you to kick against the goad . '
44026015	I said , ' Who is speaking ? ' He said , ' I am Jesus whom you are persecuting .
44026016	But rise and stand on your feet : for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you a servant and a witness of the times you have seen me and of the times I shall appear to you .
44026017	I will deliver you from your people and from the Gentiles , to whom I am sending you ,
44026018	to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among those who are made holy by faith in me . '
44026019	After that , King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
44026020	but first to the people in Damascus and then to the people of Jerusalem and through all the land of Judaea and to the Gentiles , I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds suitable for a change of heart .
44026021	" For this reason Jews seized me in the Temple courts and tried to kill me .
44026022	But obtaining help from God I have continued until this day witnessing to small and great , saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would be ,
44026023	that the Christ would suffer and that he first , by rising from the dead , would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles . "
44026024	While Paul was thus defending himself , Festus said loudly , " You are raving , Paul . Much learning is driving you insane . "
44026025	" I am not insane , " he said , " most noble Festus , but am uttering words of truth and soberness .
44026026	The King knows about this , and to him I speak with perfect frankness , for I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his attention , for this has not been done in a corner .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? I know that you believe them . "
44026028	Agrippa said to Paul , " With little effort you are persuading me to become a Christian . "
44026029	Paul said , " I would to God that whether with little or with much , not only you , but all who hear me this day , would become such as I am — except for these chains . "
44026030	Then the King rose and the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them ,
44026031	and after withdrawing they said to one another , " This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains . "
44026032	Agrippa said to Festus , " This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar . "
44027001	WHEN it was decided that we should sail for Italy , they committed Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius , of an imperial battalion .
44027002	Going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia we put to sea . Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , was with us .
44027003	On the next day we reached Sidon , where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to see his friends and enjoy their attentions .
44027004	Putting to sea from there , we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were contrary .
44027005	After crossing the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board of her .
44027007	By slow sailing for many days we with difficulty arrived off Cnidus . Then the wind being against us , we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone
44027008	and with difficulty got past it and came to a place called Fair Havens , near which was the city of Lasea .
44027009	When much time had passed and sailing was now dangerous because it was already after the Fast , Paul addressed them .
44027010	" Men , " he said , " I see that the voyage is going to be rough and with much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives . "
44027011	But the Centurion listened more to the sailing master and the ship owner than to what Paul said ,
44027012	and as the harbor was not convenient to winter in , the majority adopted the purpose of sailing away on the chance of being able to reach Phoenix and winter there . Phoenix is a harbor of Crete facing the southwest and the northwest .
44027013	When the south wind blew softly , thinking that they had secured their purpose , they weighed anchor and coasted along Crete .
44027014	But before long a hurricane , such as is called Euraquilo , swept down off the land .
44027015	When the ship was caught and unable to keep her head to the wind , we gave up and let her drive before it .
44027016	Running under the lee of an island called Cauda , we contrived with difficulty to secure the small boat .
44027017	When we had got it in , we used ropes to undergird the ship . Fearing that we might get stranded on the Syrtis , they lowered the sail and so drifted .
44027018	So violently were we battered by the storm that on the next day they lightened the ship
44027019	and on the third day with their own hands they threw over the ship's tackle .
44027020	When for many days neither sun nor stars appeared and no small tempest lay on us , at last all hope of our being saved was being taken away .
44027021	After they had long gone without food , Paul stood up in the midst of them and said , " Men , you ought to have listened to me and not to have sailed away from Crete and met this rough experience and loss .
44027022	But now I beg you to have courage , for there will be no loss of life of any of you , but only of the ship .
44027023	For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me
44027024	and said , ' Never fear , Paul ! You must stand before Caesar . And now God has granted to you all the men who are sailing with you . '
44027025	So cheer up , men . For I trust in God that it will be as it has been told me .
44027026	We must , however , run on to a certain island . "
44027027	When the fourteenth night came , as we were being driven through the Adriatic , about midnight the sailors surmised that land was getting near .
44027028	Sounding they found twenty fathoms , and after a little they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms .
44027029	Then fearing that they might run into rocky places , they cast out four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come .
44027030	The sailors were intent on escaping from the ship and lowered the small boat into the sea under the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow ,
44027031	but Paul said to the Centurion and the soldiers , " Unless these men stay in the ship , you cannot be saved . "
44027032	Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the small boat and let her fall off .
44027033	Until day began to dawn , Paul kept urging all to take food . He said , " To-day is the fourteenth day that you have been on the watch fasting , not taking anything .
44027034	Therefore , I beg you , take some food . For this is for your safety . Not a hair of the head of any one of you is going to perish . "
44027035	Saying this he took a loaf and gave thanks to God before all and broke it and began to eat .
44027036	Then all cheered up and themselves took food .
44027037	We in the ship were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls .
44027038	After eating heartily , they lightened the ship , throwing over the wheat into the sea .
44027039	When day came they did not recognize the land , but they observed a bay with a beach . Into this they planned to run the ship if they could .
44027040	So abandoning the anchors they left them in the sea ; at the same time loosening the bands of the steering oars and raising the foresail to the wind , they made for the beach .
44027041	But falling into a place where there were cross-currents they ran the ship aground . The bow stuck fast and remained immovable , but the stern was breaking up under the violence of the sea .
44027042	The soldiers ' advice was to kill the prisoners for fear that some one of them might swim out and escape .
44027043	But the Centurion , wishing to save Paul , kept them back from their plan . He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to shore ,
44027044	and the rest to follow , some on boards and some on things from the ship . And so all got safe to land .
44028001	WHEN we were safe ashore , we found that the island was called Melita .
44028002	The foreign people showed us uncommon kindness . For they kindled a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain that was falling and the cold .
44028003	Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire , when a snake came out of the heat and fastened on his hand .
44028004	When the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said to one another , " Certainly this man is a murderer , whom , although he has escaped the sea , Justice does not permit to live . "
44028005	He however shook off the creature into the fire and felt no harm .
44028006	They kept watching to see him swell up or suddenly fall down dead . But after watching a long time and seeing nothing amiss happen to him , they changed their minds and said that he was a god .
44028007	In the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the Governor of the island , whose name was Publius . He welcomed us and for three days hospitably entertained us .
44028008	It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill with fever and dysentery . Paul went in to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him .
44028009	After this happened , the rest in the island who had infirmities came also and were healed .
44028010	They bestowed many honors on us and when we sailed they put on board supplies for our needs .
44028011	After three months we sailed in a ship that had wintered in the island . She was from Alexandria and her figure-head was the Twin Brothers .
44028012	Landing at Syracuse we remained there three days .
44028013	From there we came around and got to Rhegium . After one day there , a south wind sprang up and we came on the second day to Puteoli .
44028014	Here we found brethren and were begged by them to stay seven days . And so we came to Rome .
44028015	From there the brethren , when they got news of us , came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns . On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage .
44028016	When we reached Rome , Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him .
44028017	After three days he invited the leading men among the Jews , and when they had assembled , he said to them , " Brethren , although I had done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs , I was delivered up as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
44028018	They , after investigating my case , wished to set me free because I had done nothing deserving of death .
44028019	But when the Jews spoke against it , I was compelled to appeal to Caesar , not that I have any charge to bring against my own nation .
44028020	For this reason I have invited you to see me and talk with me ; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I have this chain around me . "
44028021	They said to him , " We on our part have received no letters about you from Judaea nor has any one of the brethren come and reported or spoken anything evil of you .
44028022	We think it well to hear from you what your views are ; for as to this sect we know that it is everywhere spoken against . "
44028023	They appointed a day for him and many came to him at his lodging . He explained to them , testifying to the kingdom of God , trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets , from early morning until evening .
44028024	Some were persuaded by what he said and some did not believe .
44028025	They dispersed , disagreeing with one another , after Paul had said one word , " Well said the Holy Spirit through Isaiah , the prophet , to your fathers ,
44028026	' Go to this people and say , You will hear plainly but you will not understand , and you will see plainly but you will not perceive .
44028027	For the heart of this people has grown fat and with their ears they are hard of hearing and their eyes they have shut , so that they may never see with their eyes nor hear with their ears nor understand with their heart and repent , so that I may heal them . '
44028028	Therefore be it known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles . They will listen . "
44028030	Paul remained two whole years in his own rented lodging and received all who came to him ,
44028031	proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all freedom of speech , unhindered .
45001001	PAUL , a servant of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle , set apart to bear the good news of God ,
45001002	which he foretold through his prophets in Holy Scripture ,
45001003	concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord ( who became one of the descendants of David according to the flesh ,
45001004	and was with power proved to be the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead ) ;
45001005	through whom we obtained grace and apostleship to promote obedience of faith for the sake of his name ,
45001006	among all the Gentiles , among whom are you , called by Jesus Christ ;
45001007	to all who are in Rome , beloved by God , called to be holy : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First of all I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is spoken of through all the world .
45001009	For God , whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son , is my witness how unceasingly I make mention of you , always in my prayers
45001010	asking if I may somehow at some time by the will of God find the way open to come to you .
45001011	For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift of grace in order that you may be strengthened ,
45001012	that is , that I may be encouraged with you and by you through our mutual faith , yours and mine .
45001013	I am not willing that you should be ignorant , brethren , that often I have purposed to come to you , in order that I might have some fruit among you as among the other Gentiles .
45001014	I am a debtor to Greeks and to Barbarians , to wise men and to unthinking men ;
45001015	so , for my part , I am eager to tell the good news also to you in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the good news . It is the power of God for salvation to every one who believes , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45001017	For a righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith , as it is written , " He who is righteous by faith shall live . "
45001018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and wickedness of men who hold the truth but practice unrighteousness .
45001019	Because what may be known of God is manifest within them , for God has manifested it to them .
45001020	For God's invisible qualities — his everlasting power and deity — are , since the creation of the world , clearly seen , being known from what he has made . So they are without any excuse .
45001021	For although they knew God they did not glorify him as God and did not give him thanks , but fell into futile speculations and their stupid hearts were darkened .
45001022	Boasting of being wise , they became fools
45001023	and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into images of mortal man , and of birds and beasts and reptiles .
45001024	Therefore God gave them over , in the lusts of their hearts , to uncleanness , to dishonor their bodies mutually .
45001025	They changed the truth of God into a lie , and reverenced and paid worship to the creature rather than to the Creator — who is blessed forever , Amen !
45001026	Therefore God gave them over to disgraceful passions . For their females changed the natural use for one contrary to nature ,
45001027	and their males , leaving the natural use of the female , burned in their lust for one another , males with males practicing indecency and receiving in themselves the deserved penalty of their error .
45001028	And as they did not think fit to keep God in their knowledge , God gave them over to an abandoned mind , to do the things that are shameful ,
45001029	filled with all injustice , wickedness , greed , malice , full of envy , murder , strife , fraud , malignant craftiness , whisperers ,
45001030	slanderers , hateful to God , insolent , arrogant , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
45001031	without common sense , without faithfulness , without family affection , without pity .
45001032	They know the just judgment of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death , yet they not only do them themselves , but are pleased with those who practice them .
45002001	THEREFORE you are without excuse , O man , whoever you are , when you judge . For in judging another you condemn yourself . For you , the judge , practice the same things .
45002002	But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things .
45002003	Do you think , O man , you who judge those who practice such things while you do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
45002004	Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering , not knowing that the kindness of God is calling you to a change of heart ?
45002005	Are you with a hard and unrepentant heart treasuring for yourself wrath for the day of wrath and for the revelation of the just judgment of God ?
45002006	He will give to each an award according to his works .
45002007	To those who by constancy in good work seek for glory and honor and immortality he will award life eternal .
45002008	But to those of a partisan spirit who do not obey the truth , but obey wickedness , there will be wrath and hot anger .
45002009	Distress and crushing calamity will fall upon every human soul that works evil , upon the Jew first and also upon the Greek .
45002010	But glory and honor and peace will come to every one who works good , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45002011	For God has no partiality .
45002012	As many as have sinned without a law will perish without a law , and as many as have sinned under law will be judged by law
45002013	( for it is not the hearers of law who are righteous before God , but the doers of law are pronounced righteous ;
45002014	for when Gentiles who have no law do by nature what the Law enjoins , these , although they have no law , are a law to themselves ;
45002015	they show the requirements of the Law written in their hearts , since their conscience corroborates it and their thoughts argue in mutual accusation or in self-defense ) ,
45002016	on the day when God judges the secrets of men through Jesus Christ , as my good news sets forth .
45002017	But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law , and make your boast in God
45002018	and know his will and are a judge of things that differ , because you have been taught out of the Law
45002019	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light of those who are in darkness ,
45002020	an instructor of the unwise , a teacher of the simple , because you have the form of knowledge and of truth in the Law —
45002021	you who are teaching another , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach not to steal , do you steal ?
45002022	You who say not to commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who boast of the Law , do you dishonor God by breaking the Law ?
45002024	For " The name of God is reviled among the Gentiles because of you , " as it is written .
45002025	Circumcision has value if you obey the Law . But if you are a breaker of the Law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
45002026	If an uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law , shall not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision ?
45002027	And the natural uncircumcision if it keeps the Law will judge you who with a written code and circumcision are still a law-breaker .
45002028	For it is not he who is one outwardly that is a Jew , nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh .
45002029	But he who is one secretly is a Jew , and circumcision is of the heart and in the spirit , not in the letter . His praise is not from men , but from God .
45003001	WHAT then is the advantage of the Jew , or what is the benefit of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way . First , they were intrusted with the oracles of God .
45003003	For what if some were faithless , will their faithlessness prevent the faithfulness of God ?
45003004	Never . Let God be true , but every man a liar , as it is written , " That thou mayest be proved right in thy words and triumph when thou art judged . "
45003005	But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous when he inflicts his wrath ?
45003006	Never . If so how can God judge the world ?
45003007	But if the truth of God has become more abundant to his glory through my lie , why am I still condemned as a sinner ?
45003008	We are not going to say , as some people slanderously affirm that we say , " Let us do evil that good may come , " are we ? The condemnation of such people is just .
45003009	What then ? Have we an advantage ? Not at all . We have already brought the charge against both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin ,
45003010	as it is written , " There is not even one righteous ;
45003011	there is none that seeks God .
45003012	All have turned away ; together they have become worthless ; there is none who does what is useful , not even one .
45003013	Their throat is an open sepulcher ; with their tongues they deceive ; the poison of asps is under their lips .
45003014	Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness ;
45003015	their feet are swift to shed blood ;
45003016	ruin and misery are in their paths .
45003017	The path of peace they do not know .
45003018	There is no reverence for God before their eyes . "
45003019	We know that all that the Law says , it says to those who are under the Law , that every mouth may be shut and all the world may come under the condemnation of God .
45003020	Therefore by works of the Law no human being will be pronounced righteous before him . For through the Law comes the knowledge of sin .
45003021	But now , apart from law , a righteousness of God has been revealed , confirmed by the Law and the Prophets —
45003022	a righteousness from God through faith in Jesus Christ for all believers . For there is no difference .
45003023	All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God .
45003024	All are pronounced righteous by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ,
45003025	whom God has set forth as a propitiation by his blood through faith , for the manifestation of his righteousness , because of the passing over of previous sins in the forbearance of God —
45003026	for a manifestation at the present time of his righteousness , that he may himself be righteous and may accept as righteous him who has faith in Jesus .
45003027	Where then is boasting ? It is excluded . By what law ? That of works ? No , but by the law of faith .
45003028	For we reason that a man is pronounced righteous by faith aside from works of law .
45003029	Does God belong to the Jews only ? Does he not belong also to the Gentiles ? Yes , to the Gentiles ,
45003030	if God is one and will pronounce the circumcision righteous by faith and the uncircumcision righteous through faith .
45003031	Do we then by faith nullify the Law ? Never . On the contrary we establish the Law .
45004001	WHAT then shall we say that Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh , experienced ?
45004002	For if Abraham was pronounced righteous because of works , he had something to boast of . But he had nothing before God ;
45004003	for what says the Scripture ? " Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him for righteousness . "
45004004	To him who works , wages are credited not as by grace , but as due ;
45004005	but to him who does not work , but believes in him who calls the unrighteous man righteous , his faith is credited for righteousness .
45004006	Just so David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works ,
45004007	" Blessed are they whose lawless acts have been forgiven , and whose sins have been covered over .
45004008	Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not charge up to him . "
45004009	Does this blessedness come to the circumcision , or also to the uncircumcision ? For we say , " Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness . "
45004010	How was it credited , when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
45004011	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith that he had in uncircumcision , so that he should be the father of all who believe while uncircumcised , and righteousness should be credited to them ;
45004012	and the father of the circumcised , that is , of those who are not only circumcised , but who walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while uncircumcised .
45004013	It was not through the Law that the promise came to Abraham or to his descendants that he should be the heir of the world , but through the righteousness of faith .
45004014	For if those who are of the Law are heirs , faith is emptied of value and the promise is nullified .
45004015	For the Law works wrath . But where there is no law , neither is there lawbreaking .
45004016	Therefore all depends on faith , that it may be of grace , and thus the promise be sure for all his descendants , not only those who are of the Law , but also those who are of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of all of us
45004017	, in the view of the God whom he believed , who makes alive the dead and calls things that are not as if they were .
45004018	Abraham , when hope was past , believed in hope so that he became the father of many nations , according to what was said to him , " So shall your descendants be " ;
45004019	and without being weakened in faith he recognized his own body as dead , when he was about a hundred years old , and the deadness of Sarah's womb .
45004020	Still he did not hesitate through want of faith in the promise of God , but was strong in faith , thus giving glory to God ,
45004021	and was fully confident that what God had promised he was able to perform .
45004022	Therefore it was credited to him for righteousness .
45004023	It was not written for his sake only , that it was credited to him ,
45004024	but also for our sake , to whom it will be credited if we believe in him who raised up from the dead Jesus our Lord ,
45004025	who was delivered up on account of our sins and was raised again that we might be accounted righteous .
45005001	SO then , since we have been accounted righteous by faith , let us have peace with God , through our Lord Jesus Christ .
45005002	Through him we obtained entrance into this grace in which we stand and exult in hope of the glory of God .
45005003	Not only so , but we also exult in trials , knowing that trial develops endurance ,
45005004	and endurance develops a tested character , and a tested character develops hope ,
45005005	and hope does not disappoint , for the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit granted to us .
45005006	For while we were still without strength Christ , at the due time , died for the unrighteous .
45005007	Hardly for a righteous man will any one die . For a good man some one perhaps may dare to die .
45005008	But God shows his own love to us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us .
45005009	Much more then , now that we have been pronounced righteous through his blood , shall we be saved from wrath by him .
45005010	For if while enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , now that we are reconciled , shall we be saved by his life .
45005011	And not only so , but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now obtained the reconciliation .
45005012	Therefore as through one man sin entered the world , and through sin death entered , and so death spread to all men , since all sinned —
45005013	for down to the time of the Law sin was in the world , and yet sin is not charged where there is no law ;
45005014	but death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned like Adam , who is the type of him who was coming .
45005015	But the gracious gift is not like the fall . For if by the fall of the one the many sinned , much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many .
45005016	And the free gift was not like the sentence that came through one who sinned ; for the sentence came from one fall for condemnation , but the free gift was that men should be called righteous in spite of many falls .
45005017	For if by the fall of one man death reigned through that one , much more those who receive the abounding grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through one , that is , through Jesus Christ .
45005018	As then through one fall sentence came upon all men and they were condemned ; so through one righteous act the free gift came to all men so that they are pronounced righteous and live .
45005019	For as by the disobedience of the one man the many were set down as sinners , so by the obedience of the one the many will be set down as righteous .
45005020	But law came in alongside that the fall might be greater ; but where sin became greater grace became greater still ,
45005021	in order that as sin reigned in death grace might reign through righteousness and issue in life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	WHAT shall we say then ? Shall we remain in sin so that grace may be great ?
45006002	Never . How shall we who died to sin still live in it ?
45006003	Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
45006004	We were buried with him by baptism into death , in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we too might walk in newness of life .
45006005	For if we have grown into union with him by the likeness of his death , surely we shall be united with him by the likeness of his resurrection .
45006006	For we know this , that our old-time humanity was crucified with him , in order that the sinful body might be made powerless , that we might no longer be slaves of sin .
45006007	For one who has died has been pronounced righteous and free from sin .
45006008	But if we died with Christ we believe that we shall live with him ,
45006009	knowing that Christ , after being raised from the dead , dies no more ; death no more reigns over him .
45006010	For the death that he died , he died to sin once for all ; but the life that he lives , he lives to God .
45006011	So you must think yourselves dead to sin , but living to God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you will obey its lusts ,
45006013	and do not yield your members to sin as the instruments of wickedness ; but present yourselves to God as men once dead , but now living , and yield your members to God as the instruments of righteousness .
45006014	For sin shall not be king over you ; for you are not under law , but under grace .
45006015	What then ? May we sin because we are not under law , but under grace ? Never .
45006016	Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants intending obedience , you are the servants of the one you obey , whether of sin , resulting in death , or of obedience , resulting in righteousness ?
45006017	Thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to the type of teaching in which you were instructed .
45006018	You were made free from sin and made servants to righteousness .
45006019	I am speaking humanly on account of the weakness of your human nature . As you did present your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness to do lawlessness , so now you have presented your members as servants to righteousness for holy living .
45006020	When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness .
45006021	What fruit did you have then ? Fruit of which you are now ashamed ; for the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now freed from sin and having become servants of God you have your fruit in holy living and its outcome , life eternal .
45006023	For the wages of sin is death , but the gracious gift of God is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	ARE you ignorant , brethren , for I am speaking to those who know law , that the Law rules over a person while he is living ?
45007002	For a married woman is by law bound to her husband while he is living . But if the husband dies , she is freed from the law of her husband .
45007003	Therefore while her husband is living she is called an adulteress if she becomes another man's . But if her husband dies she is free from the law , so that she is not an adulteress when she becomes another man's .
45007004	So , my brethren , you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ , that you might become wedded to another , to him who was raised from the dead , that we might bear fruit to God .
45007005	For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions that arise through the Law were active in our members , so that we bore fruit to death .
45007006	But now the Law has been made inoperative on us , since we have died to that by which we were held , so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter .
45007007	What shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? Never . But I should not have come to know sin except through the Law . I should not have known lust if the Law had not said , " Thou shalt not lust . "
45007008	Sin , taking occasion through the commandment , worked in me every lust . For apart from the Law sin is dead .
45007009	I was living once , apart from law . But when the commandment came , sin began to live and I died ,
45007010	and the commandment which meant life was found to mean death .
45007011	For sin , taking occasion through the commandment , deceived me and by it killed me .
45007012	So the Law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good .
45007013	Did then what is good become death to me ? Never . But sin , that it might appear sin , worked death in me through the good , in order that it might become beyond measure sinful .
45007014	For we know that the Law is spiritual ; but I am fleshly , sold under sin .
45007015	For what I am doing I do not understand . For not what I choose is what I practice , but what I hate , this I do .
45007016	But if I do what I do not choose , I agree with the law that it is right .
45007017	And now it is no longer I that do it , but the Sin that dwells in me .
45007021	I find then this rule , when I choose to do the right , that evil is present with me .
45007022	I delight in the Law in my inner man ,
45007023	but I see another law in my members , warring with the law of my mind and leading me captive under the law of sin which is in my members .
45007024	Wretched man that I am ! who will deliver me from this body of death ?
45007025	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then I myself with my mind serve the Law of God , but with my flesh the law of sin .
45008001	THERE is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed you from the Law of sin and death .
45008003	For , what was impossible for the Law , because it was weak through the flesh — God , sending his own Son in the form of sinful flesh and for sin , condemned the sin that is in the flesh ,
45008004	so that the righteousness required by the Law might be fulfilled in us who live not according to the flesh , but according to the spirit .
45008005	For those who are living according to the flesh have their minds on the things of the flesh , but those who are living according to the spirit have their minds on the things of the spirit .
45008006	Fleshly mindedness is death , but spiritual mindedness is life and peace .
45008007	Therefore fleshly mindedness is hostile to God ; for it is not subject to the Law of God , nor can it be .
45008008	Those who are in the flesh cannot please God .
45008009	But you are not in the flesh , but in the spirit , if the Spirit of God dwells in you . If any one has not the Spirit of Christ , that man is not his .
45008010	If Christ is in you the body is dead because of sin , but the spirit is life because of righteousness .
45008011	If the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead gives life even to your mortal bodies , through his indwelling Spirit in you .
45008012	So then , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh to live according to the flesh ;
45008013	for if you live according to the flesh , you will die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body , you will live .
45008014	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
45008015	For you did not receive a spirit of bondage leading again to fear , but you received a spirit of sonship , in which we cry , Abba , Father .
45008016	The Spirit itself witnesses with our spirits that we are children of God .
45008017	And if children , we are also heirs — heirs of God , joint heirs with Christ , since we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him .
45008018	For I estimate that the sufferings of this present time amount to nothing in comparison with the glory that is to be revealed for us .
45008019	For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God .
45008020	For the creation was made subject to folly not willingly , but for the sake of him who subjected it , in hope ,
45008021	because the creation itself will be freed from the slavery of decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God .
45008022	For we know that all the creation groans in the pangs of childbirth until now .
45008023	And not the creation alone , but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit , groan within ourselves in expectation of the sonship , the liberation of our bodies .
45008024	For we are saved by hope ; but hope that is seen is not hope , for what any one sees , why does he hope for ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we do not see , we patiently wait for it .
45008026	Thus also the Spirit helps us in our weakness . For we do not know what to pray for as we ought , but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with sighs beyond words .
45008027	And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit , because he intercedes for the holy according to the will of God .
45008028	We know that all things work together for good to those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
45008029	For those whom he foreknew he also predetermined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the first-born among many brethren .
45008030	And those whom he predetermined he also called , and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous , and those whom he pronounced righteous he also glorified .
45008031	What then shall we say to this ? If God is for us , who is against us ?
45008032	He who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all , how shall he not with him graciously give us all things ?
45008033	Who shall bring a charge against God's elect ? God pronounces them righteous .
45008034	Who is there to condemn ? Christ Jesus died , or rather was raised , and he is on the right hand of God interceding for us .
45008035	Who shall separate us from Christ's love ? Shall trial or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword ?
45008037	On the contrary , in all these we more than conquer through him who loved us .
45008038	For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor archangels , nor things present nor things to come , nor powers ,
45008039	nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God's love in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I AM speaking the truth in Christ ; I am saying nothing false ; my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit
45009002	that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart .
45009003	For I could wish myself to be accursed and cast away from Christ for the sake of my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh ,
45009004	who are Israelites , whose is the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the reception of the law and the worship and the promises ;
45009005	whose are the fathers and from whom by physical descent the Christ came . God who is over all be blessed through the ages ! Amen .
45009006	Not that God's word has failed . For not all who are of Israel are Israel ;
45009007	nor because they are descendants of Abraham are they all children ; but " through Isaac shall your descendants be named . "
45009008	That is , not the physical descendants are children , but the children of the promise are counted for descendants .
45009009	For the wording of the promise was , " At this time next year I will come and Sarah shall have a son . "
45009010	And not only so , but when Rebecca was about to bear children to our father Isaac ,
45009011	though the same man was father of both children and they were not yet born and had done nothing good or bad , in order that the purpose of God according to his choice might stand , not according to their works , but according to his call ,
45009012	it was said to her , " The older shall serve the younger . "
45009013	In the same way it is written , " Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . "
45009014	What shall we say then ? Is there unrighteousness on God's part ? Never .
45009015	For he says to Moses , " I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . "
45009016	So then it is not a question of the man who wills or who runs , but of God who shows mercy .
45009017	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , " For this very purpose I raised you up in order to show my power upon you and to have my name proclaimed in all the earth . "
45009018	So then he has mercy on whom he chooses and he hardens whom he chooses .
45009019	You will say to me then , " Why does he still find fault ? For who has opposed his will ? "
45009020	But who are you , O man , who are answering back to God ? Does the thing that is moulded say to the moulder , " Why have you made me so ? "
45009021	Has not the potter the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for honor and another for dishonor ?
45009022	What if God , choosing to exhibit his wrath and to make known what he can do , bore in long patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction ,
45009023	and in order to make known the richness of his glory upon the vessels of mercy which he had prepared for glory
45009024	called us not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles ?
45009025	As also he says in Hosea , " Those who are not my people I will call my people , and her who has not been beloved I will call beloved ,
45009026	and in the place where it was said to them , ' You are not my people , ' there they shall be called sons of the living God . "
45009027	Isaiah cried aloud regarding Israel , " Though the number of the sons of Israel is as the sand of the sea , only a remnant will be saved .
45009028	For the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and speedily . "
45009029	Even as Isaiah predicted , " Unless the Lord of armies had left us some descendants , we should have become like Sodom and should have been made to resemble Gomorrah . "
45009030	What shall we say then ? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained righteousness , the righteousness of faith ,
45009031	but Israel pursuing after the Law of righteousness did not attain to the Law .
45009032	Why ? Because they pursued it not by faith , but as it were by works . They stumbled over that stumbling stone ,
45009033	as it is written , " See , I am laying in Zion a stumbling stone , a rock to trip over , but he who has faith in him will never be put to shame . "
45010001	BRETHREN , the desire of my heart and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation .
45010002	For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God , but not an intelligent one .
45010003	For , ignorant of God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own , they have not submitted to God's righteousness .
45010004	For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every believer .
45010005	For Moses writes that he who does the righteousness of the Law shall live by it .
45010006	But the righteousness of faith says , " Do not say in your heart , ' Who shall ascend into heaven ? ' that is , to bring Christ down — "
45010007	or , ' Who shall descend into the abyss ? ' " — that is , to bring up Christ from the dead .
45010008	But what does it say ? " The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart " — that is , the word of faith which we are proclaiming ,
45010009	that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved .
45010010	For with the heart a man believes and becomes righteous , and with the mouth he confesses and attains salvation .
45010011	For the Scripture says , " No one who believes in him will be put to shame . "
45010012	For there is no difference between Jew and Greek . For there is the same Lord of all , rich toward all who call upon him .
45010013	For " Every one who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . "
45010014	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? How shall they hear without some one to proclaim him ?
45010015	How shall they proclaim him unless they are sent ? As it is written , " How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news ! "
45010016	But have not all heard the good news ? For Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our report ? "
45010017	So then faith comes from the report and report comes through the word of Christ .
45010018	But I say , it cannot be true that they have not heard , can it ? On the contrary , " Their sound has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world . "
45010019	I say , it cannot be that Israel did not know , can it ? First Moses says , " I will excite you to jealousy by what is not a nation and by a foolish nation I will provoke you to anger . "
45010020	And Isaiah makes bold to say , " I was found by those who were not seeking me : I became manifest to those who were not inquiring for me . "
45010021	But to Israel he says , " All day long I stretched forth my hands to a people who disobey and answer back . "
45011001	I SAY then , can it be that God has repudiated his people ? Never . For I am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not repudiated his people whom he foreknew . Do you not know what the Scripture says in the story of Elijah , how he prays to God against Israel ?
45011003	" Lord , they have killed thy prophets : they have demolished thy altars , and I only am left and they are seeking my life . "
45011004	But what was the divine response ? " I have left to myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal . "
45011005	So at this present time there is a remnant according to a gracious selection .
45011006	But if it is by grace it is no longer because of works , for then grace would be no longer grace .
45011007	What then ? Israel has not found what it is seeking , but the chosen have found it . And the rest have been made dull ,
45011008	as it is written , " God gave them a stupid spirit , eyes not for seeing and ears not for hearing until this day . "
45011009	And David says , " Let their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution .
45011010	Let their eyes be darkened so as not to see , and bow down their backs always . "
45011011	I say , then , have they stumbled just in order that they may fall ? Never . But by their fall salvation comes to the Gentiles so as to arouse the emulation of the Jews .
45011012	If their fall is the riches of the world and their loss the riches of the Gentiles , how much more will their full restoration be !
45011013	But I say to you Gentiles — since I am an apostle to Gentiles I glory in my office ,
45011014	if in any way I may arouse to emulation my own kindred and save some of them —
45011015	if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world , what will their welcome back be but life from the dead ?
45011016	If the first fruit was holy , so will the mass be ; and if the root was holy , so will be the branches .
45011017	If some of the branches were broken off and you , who are a wild olive , were grafted in among them and became a sharer in the root and rich sap of the olive ,
45011018	do not exult over the branches . Even though you exult , it is not you who are supporting the root , but the root is supporting you .
45011019	You will say then , " Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in . "
45011020	Certainly , for lack of faith they were broken off , and you are standing by faith . Do not be proud , but be afraid .
45011021	For if God did not spare the natural branches , neither will he spare you .
45011022	See the kindness and the rigor of God , toward those who fell rigor , but toward you God's kindness , if you continue in his kindness , else you too will be cut off .
45011023	And they if they do not continue in their unbelief will be grafted in .
45011024	For God is able to graft them back . For if you were cut from your natural stock , a wild olive tree , and were grafted , contrary to nature , into a good olive tree , how much more will the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree !
45011025	I would not have you ignorant , brethren , of this mystery , that you may not be self-conceited , because stupidity in a measure has come upon Israel until the full number of Gentiles comes in ,
45011026	and thus all Israel will be saved , as it is written , " From Zion will come the deliverer . He will remove ungodliness from Jacob .
45011027	And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins . "
45011028	According to the good news they are enemies for your sake , but according to the promise they are beloved for their fathers ' sake .
45011029	God never changes his mind about his gifts and his call .
45011030	For as you were once disobedient to God , but now have found mercy through their disobedience ,
45011031	so they have now been disobedient in your time of mercy , that they too may now obtain mercy .
45011032	For God has shut up all in unbelief in order that he may have mercy on all .
45011033	O the depth of the wealth both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments , how untraceable his ways !
45011034	For who has known the mind of the Lord ? Or who became his counsellor ?
45011035	Who first gave to him so as to receive repayment ?
45011036	For from him and through him and to him are all things . To him be glory through the ages ! Amen .
45012001	I BEG you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice , pleasing to God — your rational worship .
45012002	Do not follow the fashions of this world , but be transformed by the renewal of your minds so as to recognize what is the good and pleasing and perfect will of God .
45012003	Through the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought , but to think so as to become wise , as God has allotted to each a measure of faith .
45012004	For as in one body we have many members and the members do not all have the same function ,
45012005	so we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another .
45012006	Having gifts differing according to the grace given to us , if it is prophecy , let us use it according to the proportion of our faith ;
45012007	if it is service , let us use it in service . Let the teacher use his gift in teaching .
45012008	Let the exhorter use his gift in exhorting . Let him who gives do it in simplicity . Let him who manages do it earnestly . Let him who helps the needy do it cheerfully .
45012009	Let your love be without pretense . Abhor what is evil ; cling to the good .
45012010	Have brotherly love toward one another like family affection , in honor preferring one another ,
45012011	never flagging in zeal , fervent in spirit , serving the Lord ,
45012012	rejoicing in hope , patient in trial , constant in prayer ,
45012013	contributing to the needs of the holy , devoted to hospitality .
45012014	Pray for blessings on your persecutors , blessings , not curses .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep .
45012016	Be in harmony with one another . Do not be thinking of high things , but be content with humble things . Do not become conceited .
45012017	Repay to no one evil for evil . Aim at what is honorable in the sight of all men .
45012018	If possible , so far as depends on you , live at peace with all men .
45012019	Do not revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God's wrath . For it is written , " Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
45012020	But , " if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him drink ; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head . "
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
45013001	LET every person be obedient to the superior authorities . For there is no authority except from God and the actual authorities have been appointed by God .
45013002	So he who resists the authority opposes the arrangement of God . Those who resist will bring on themselves condemnation .
45013003	For rulers are not a terror to good deeds , but to bad . Do you wish not to fear the authority ? Do what is good and you will have praise from it .
45013004	For he is a servant of God to promote your good . But if you are doing evil , be afraid ; for he does not bear the sword to no purpose . For he is God's servant to inflict his wrath on him who practices evil .
45013005	Therefore we must be obedient , not only because of the punishment but as a matter of conscience .
45013006	For this reason also you pay tribute . For they are God's officers attending to this very thing .
45013007	Pay to all their dues , tribute to whom tribute is due , custom to whom custom is due , respect to whom respect is due , honor to whom honor is due .
45013008	Owe no one anything , except to love one another . He who loves the other has fulfilled the Law .
45013009	For the commandments , " Thou shalt not commit adultery , " " Thou shalt not commit murder , " " Thou shalt not steal , " " Thou shalt not covet , " and any other that there may be , are summed up in this : " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . "
45013010	Love works no evil to a neighbor . Love therefore is full obedience to the Law .
45013011	Live thus because you know this crisis , for it is already time for you to awake from sleep . For now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers .
45013012	The night is far spent , the day draws near . Let us put away the deeds of darkness , let us put on the weapons of light .
45013013	Let us live becomingly as in the day , not in revelry and drunkenness , not in sensuality and licentiousness , not in quarrelling and jealousy .
45013014	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for gratifying physical passions .
45014001	WELCOME him who is weak in the faith , but not in order to decide disputed questions .
45014002	One man believes in eating all things . The weak man eats vegetables .
45014003	The man who eats is not to despise the one who does not eat , and he who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats . For God has accepted him .
45014004	Who are you to judge the servant of another ? To his own master he stands or falls , and stand he will , for God is able to make him stand .
45014005	One man esteems one day above another , another man esteems every day . Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind .
45014006	He who regards the day regards it to the Lord and he who eats eats to the Lord , for he gives thanks to God . And he who does not eat abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God .
45014007	For no one of us is living for himself and no one dies for himself .
45014008	If we live we live for the Lord and if we die we die for the Lord . So whether we live or die we are the Lord's .
45014009	For to this end Christ died and lived again , in order that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living .
45014010	But you , why do you judge your brother ? Or you , why do you treat your brother with contempt ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God .
45014011	For it is written , " As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bend to me and every tongue shall confess to God . "
45014012	So then each one of us shall give account for himself to God .
45014013	Therefore let us no longer judge one another , but let us rather decide not to put a stumbling block in a brother's way , or anything to trip him up .
45014014	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiling in itself . But to one who thinks anything to be defiling it is defiling .
45014015	If because of your food your brother is grieved , you are no longer walking in love . Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died .
45014016	Do not let what is good to you be spoken of as evil .
45014017	For the kingdom of God is not food and drink , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	For he who thus serves Christ is pleasing to God and esteemed by men .
45014019	Therefore , let us seek for what makes for peace and our mutual upbuilding .
45014020	Do not for the sake of food break down the work of God . All things are pure , but anything is evil to the man who eats it with a feeling of doing wrong .
45014021	It is noble not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything over which your brother stumbles .
45014022	The faith that you have , have to yourself before God . Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself for what he allows himself .
45014023	He who has doubts and still eats stands condemned , because he is not acting from faith . But whatever does not spring from faith is sin .
45015001	WE who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
45015002	Each of us should please his neighbor for his good so as to build him up .
45015003	For Christ did not please himself , but , as it is written , " The reproaches of those who were reproaching thee fell on me . "
45015004	All that was written of old was written for our instruction , in order that by patience and by the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope .
45015005	May the God of patience and encouragement grant to you to have harmony with one another , in the manner of Christ Jesus ,
45015006	so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Therefore , welcome one another as Christ welcomed us , to the glory of God .
45015008	For I say that Christ became a servant of circumcision for the sake of God's truth , in order to confirm the promises given to the fathers
45015009	and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy , as it is written , " For this will I confess thee among the Gentiles and sing to thy name . "
45015010	And again Scripture says , " Rejoice , Gentiles , with his people . "
45015011	And again , " Sing to the Lord , all Gentiles , and let all the peoples praise him . "
45015012	And again Isaiah says , " There will be a root of Jesse , and one who rises to rule Gentiles : in him Gentiles will hope . "
45015013	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , so that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit !
45015014	I am persuaded , my brethren — yes , I myself — regarding you , that you are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able to instruct one another .
45015015	But I have written rather boldly to you , partly to remind you , because of the grace given to me from God ,
45015016	that I may be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles , in priestly service of the good news of God , in order that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	I do boast in Christ Jesus of my work for God .
45015018	For I will not venture to speak except of what Christ has done through me to promote obedience of Gentiles , by word and deed ,
45015019	through the power of signs and wonders , by the power of the Holy Spirit , so that from Jerusalem around to Illyricum , I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ ,
45015020	being ambitious to tell the good news where Christ has not been named , so that I might not build on any other man's foundation ,
45015021	but as it is written , " They who have had no message of him shall see and they who have not heard shall understand . "
45015022	This is why I have been so much hindered in coming to you .
45015023	But now having no more territory in these regions and having for many years had a strong desire to come to you
45015024	while making a journey to Spain , I hope to see you as I pass through and to be furthered on my journey by you , after first partially satisfying my desire of being with you .
45015025	But now I am on my way to Jerusalem to render service to the holy .
45015026	For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the holy in Jerusalem .
45015027	They have been pleased to do this and indeed they are indebted to them . For if the Gentiles have shared their things of the spirit , they owe them sacred service in things of the body .
45015028	So after completing this and sealing to them this fruit , I shall come away and pass by you to Spain .
45015029	And I know that when I come to you it will be in the fullness of the blessing of Christ .
45015030	I beg you , brethren , for the sake of our Lord Jesus and the love of the Spirit to join me in wrestling in prayer to God on my behalf ,
45015031	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judaea and that my service in Jerusalem may be pleasing to the holy ,
45015032	that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and be refreshed with you .
45015033	The God of peace be with all of you ! Amen .
45016001	I COMMEND to you our sister Phoebe , a servant of the church in Cenchreae ,
45016002	that you may receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the holy , and help her in any matter in which she may need you . For she has been a provider for many , myself included .
45016003	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	who for my life risked their own necks , to whom not I alone give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles .
45016005	Give my greetings also to the church in their house . Give my greetings to Epaenetus my beloved , who is the first-fruit of Asia for Christ .
45016006	Give my greetings to Mary , who has worked hard for you .
45016007	Give my greetings to Andronicus and Junias , men of my race and my companions in prison , who are eminent among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
45016008	Give my greetings to Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord .
45016009	Give my greetings to Urbanus our fellow worker in Christ , and to Stachys my beloved .
45016010	Give my greetings to Apelles , that tested man in Christ . Give my greetings to the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Give my greetings to Herodion , who is of my race . Give my greetings to those of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord .
45016012	Give my greetings to Tryphaena and Tryphosa , those workers in the Lord . Give my greetings to Persis the beloved , who has worked hard in the Lord .
45016013	Give my greetings to Rufus the chosen in the Lord , and to his mother and mine .
45016014	Give my greetings to Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Petrobas , Hermas , and the brethren with them .
45016015	Give my greetings to Philologus , and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the holy with them .
45016016	Give my greetings to one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ send their greetings to you .
45016017	I beg you , brethren , to keep your eye on those who are making divisions and occasions for sin contrary to the teaching which you have learned , and to shun them .
45016018	For such persons are not serving our Lord Christ , but their own stomachs , and by their smooth and pleasing talk they mislead the hearts of the innocent .
45016019	For your obedience has come to the knowledge of all men . Therefore I rejoice over you , but I wish you to be wise regarding what is good , and simple in regard to what is evil .
45016020	The God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you !
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , sends his greeting , and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , who are of my race .
45016022	I , Tertius , who penned this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , my host and the host of the whole church , sends his greetings . Erastus the city treasurer sends his greetings , and so does Quartus the brother .
45016025	To him who is able to make you strong according to the good news which I bear , and the proclamation of Jesus Christ , and according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret through ages ,
45016026	but now made manifest through the prophetic Scriptures by the command of the eternal God , to promote obedience to the faith made known to all the Gentiles —
45016027	to God , the only wise , be glory through Jesus Christ for the ages of the ages !
46001001	PAUL called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and Sosthenes our brother ,
46001002	to the Church of God in Corinth , made holy in Christ Jesus , called to be holy , with all everywhere who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours :
46001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ !
46001004	I am always thanking God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus ,
46001005	that you are rich in him in everything , in readiness of speech and in all knowledge ,
46001006	so that my testimony to Christ has been confirmed among you
46001007	and so that you are not lacking in any gift while waiting for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed .
46001008	He will keep you strong to the end and free from reproach on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful , and it is by him that you have been called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	I beg you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , all to say the same thing and not to have divisions among you , but to be united in the same mind and in the same opinion .
46001011	For it has been told me regarding you , brethren , by Chloe's people , that there are dissensions among you .
46001012	I mean that each of you is saying , " I belong to Paul , " " I belong to Apollos , " " I belong to Cephas , " or , " I belong to Christ . "
46001013	Has Christ been divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I am thankful that I baptized no one of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name .
46001016	I baptized also the household of Stephanas . Beyond that I do not know that I baptized any one else .
46001017	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to proclaim the good news — not in wisdom of words , that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of meaning .
46001018	For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
46001019	For it is written , " I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nought the prudence of the prudent . "
46001020	Where is the wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the debater of this world ? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
46001021	For when in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not come to know God , God was pleased to save through the foolishness of our proclamation those who believe .
46001022	Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek for wisdom ,
46001023	but we proclaim Christ crucified , to Jews a stumbling block , to Gentiles folly ,
46001024	but to those who are called , whether Jews or Greeks , Christ , the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For God's foolishness is wiser than men and God's weakness is stronger than men .
46001026	Consider your own call , brethren , that not many wise , humanly speaking , not many powerful , not many high-born have been called .
46001027	But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise , and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the strong ,
46001028	and God has chosen the low-born things and the things of no account , the things that are not , to defeat the things that are ,
46001029	that no human being may boast in God's presence .
46001030	By God's act you are in Christ Jesus , who has become to us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and deliverance ,
46001031	so that , as it is written , " Let him who boasts boast in the Lord . "
46002001	AND I in coming to you , brethren , did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom , announcing to you the testimony of God .
46002002	For I determined to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ — and him crucified .
46002003	And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling ,
46002004	and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom , but with spiritual and powerful proof ,
46002005	that your faith might not depend on the wisdom of man but on the power of God .
46002006	We do speak wisdom among the mature , but a wisdom not of this world nor of the defeated rulers of this world .
46002007	But we speak a wisdom of God in a mystery , the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the world began for our glory .
46002008	None of the rulers of this world knew it , for if they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But as it is written , " What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard and what has not entered human mind , God has prepared for those who love him . "
46002010	To us God has revealed this by his Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , even the depths of God .
46002011	For who of men knows what pertains to a man except the spirit of the man which is in him . Just so no one knows what pertains to God except the Spirit of God .
46002012	But we did not receive the spirit of the world , but the Spirit that is from God , so that we know the gracious gifts of God .
46002013	And these we speak of , not in words taught by man's wisdom , but in words taught by the Spirit , expressing spiritual things in spiritual words .
46002014	But the animal man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him , nor can he know them because they are spiritually understood .
46002015	But the spiritual man understands all things though he himself is understood by no one .
46002016	For " Who has known the mind of the Lord ? Who will teach him ? " But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	AND I myself , brethren , could not speak to you as spiritual , but as fleshly , as babes in Christ .
46003002	I fed you with milk , not solid food . For you were not able to take it . Nor are you yet able , for you are still fleshly .
46003003	For while there is jealousy and strife among you , are you not fleshly and living in man's way ?
46003004	For when one says , " I belong to Paul , " and another , " I belong to Apollos , " are you not men ?
46003005	What then is Apollos ? What is Paul ? Servants through whom you were led to faith , as the Lord granted to each of us .
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God made the seed grow .
46003007	So then neither is he who planted anything nor he who watered , but God who makes the seed grow .
46003008	Each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
46003009	We are God's fellow workers : you are God's farm God's building .
46003010	According to the grace of God granted to me , as a wise master-builder I have laid a foundation and another is building on it . But let each be careful how he builds on it .
46003011	For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	If any one builds on this foundation gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay , straw —
46003013	every one's work will become manifest . For the day will show it , because it will be revealed in fire and the fire will test each one's work , of what quality it is .
46003014	If the work which any one has built stands he will get a reward .
46003015	If any one's work burns up he will suffer loss , though he himself will be saved , but as through fire .
46003016	Do you not know that you are God's temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
46003017	If any one mars the temple of God , God will mar him , for the temple of God is holy , and you are the temple .
46003018	Let no one deceive himself . If any one of you thinks himself wise in this world , let him become a fool in order to become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight . For it is written , " He catches the wise in their own craftiness , "
46003020	and again , " The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise to be futile . "
46003021	Therefore let no one boast in men . For all things are yours —
46003022	Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come — all are yours
46003023	and you are Christ's and Christ is God's .
46004001	LET a man view us as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries .
46004002	Moreover , in the case of stewards it is required that a man be found faithful .
46004003	But it is of very slight importance to me to be judged by you or any human court . I do not even pass judgment on myself .
46004004	For I am not conscious of any wrong , but I am not proved by that to be faultless . The Lord is my judge .
46004005	So do not judge anything before the time , before the Lord comes . He will throw light on the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the purposes of hearts . Then each one will have his praise from God .
46004006	All this , brethren , I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sake , that you may learn the maxim , " Nothing beyond what is written , " and may not be puffed up in partisanship for one against the other .
46004007	For who gives you superiority ? What have you that you did not receive ? Why are you boasting as if you had not received it ?
46004008	You are already fully satisfied . You have already become rich . You have become kings without us . Would that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you !
46004009	For it seems to me that God has set us apostles out last of all as men doomed to death , that we may be a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men .
46004010	We are fools for Christ's sake , but you are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but you are strong ; you have glory , but we are despised .
46004011	Up to this present hour we are hungry and thirsty and naked and beaten . We wander about
46004012	and labor , working with our own hands . When abused we bless , when persecuted we endure it ,
46004013	when slandered we entreat . We have come to be , as it were , the sweepings of the world , the riffraff of all things up to now .
46004014	I am not writing this to shame you , but to warn you as my beloved children .
46004015	For if you have ten thousand teachers in Christ , still you have not many fathers . For I was your father in Christ Jesus through the good news .
46004016	So I beg you to be imitators of me .
46004017	For this very purpose I have sent to you Timothy , who is my loved and faithful child in the Lord . He will remind you of my ways in Christ — how I teach everywhere in every church .
46004018	Some persons have become puffed up , thinking that I am not coming to you .
46004019	But I shall come to you shortly , if the Lord wills , and I will find out , not the talk of these puffed-up ones , but their power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God is not in talk , but in power .
46004021	Which do you wish ? Shall I come with a rod or in love and a spirit of gentleness ?
46005001	IT is generally reported that there is unchastity among you , and such unchastity as is not even among the Gentiles , so that a man has his father's wife !
46005002	And you are puffed up with pride and have not rather grieved and taken steps to expel from among you the doer of this deed !
46005003	For I , absent in body , but present in spirit , have already as if I were present judged the man who has acted thus .
46005004	When you assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit was also present with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	I decided to deliver over such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord .
46005006	Your boasting is unbecoming . Do you not know that a little yeast sets the whole mass fermenting ?
46005007	Cleanse out the old yeast that you may be new dough , free from yeast , as indeed you are . For Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed .
46005008	So let us keep the festival , not with the old yeast nor with the yeast of evil and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with unchaste people ,
46005010	certainly not meaning the unchaste of this world , or the covetous or extortionate or idolaters , since in that case you would have to leave the world .
46005011	But now I write to you not to associate with any one who is called a brother , if he is unchaste or covetous or idolatrous or abusive or drunken or extortionate — not even to eat with such a one .
46005012	For what business of mine is it to judge outsiders ? Is it not for you to judge those inside ?
46005013	But outsiders God will judge . Expel the wicked man from among yourselves .
46006001	DOES any one of you , if he has a grievance against another , dare to bring the case before the unrighteous and not before the holy ?
46006002	Do you not know that the holy are going to judge the world ? If the world is to be judged by you , are you unfit for the most trivial cases ?
46006003	Do you not know that we are to judge angels , to say nothing of affairs of this life ?
46006004	If then you have affairs of this life , do you ask men who in the view of the church count for nothing to sit as judges ?
46006005	I say this to your shame . Is it true that there is among you no one wise enough to judge between a man and his brother ,
46006006	but brother goes to law with brother and that before unbelievers ?
46006007	Now this is an utter failure on your part that you have lawsuits with one another . Why not rather let yourselves be wronged ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
46006008	But you yourselves practice wrongs and frauds — and that upon your brethren .
46006009	Do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Make no mistake , neither the unchaste , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor those who practice unnatural vices ,
46006010	nor thieves , nor the avaricious , nor drunkards , nor the abusive , nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	And such some of you were . But you have washed yourselves ; but you have been made holy ; but you have been pronounced righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	All things are lawful for me , but not everything is beneficial . All things are lawful , but I will not be overpowered by anything .
46006013	Food of all kinds is for the stomach and the stomach for foods . But God will end the function of one and the other . The body is not for unchastity , but for the Lord , and the Lord is for the body .
46006014	God raised the Lord and will also raise us through his power .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? Never !
46006016	Do you not know that he who unites himself to a prostitute is one body with her ? For God says , " The two shall become one flesh . "
46006017	He who is united to the Lord is one spirit .
46006018	Shun unchastity . Every other sin that a man does is apart from the body , but the unchaste sins against his own body .
46006019	Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you , which you have from God , and that you are not your own ?
46006020	For you were bought with a price . Glorify God then in your bodies .
46007001	WITH reference to the matters you wrote of : It is an excellent thing for a man not to touch a woman .
46007002	But because of the prevailing unchastity , let each man have his own wife and each woman her own husband .
46007003	Let the husband pay his wife conjugal dues and the wife her husband .
46007004	The wife has not power over her own body , but her husband has . In the same way the husband has not power over his own body , but his wife has .
46007005	Do not deprive one another , unless by agreement for a time , that you may have freedom for prayer , and again come together . You must not let Satan tempt you through your lack of self-control .
46007006	I say this by way of indulgence , not by way of command .
46007007	I wish that every one were just as I am . But each has his own gift from God , one in one way and one in another .
46007008	I say to the unmarried and the widows , it is excellent for them to remain as I do .
46007009	But if they lack self-control , let them marry . It is better to marry than to burn .
46007010	To the married I command — yet not I , but the Lord — that the wife is not to leave her husband
46007011	and the husband is not to put away his wife .
46007012	To the rest I say — not the Lord : If any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is pleased to live with him , let him not put her away .
46007013	And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is pleased to live with her , let her not put him away .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by the wife and the unbelieving wife has been made holy by the husband . Otherwise your children would be impure , but now they are holy .
46007015	But if the unbelieving one actually leaves , let him leave . The brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases ; but God has called you to peace .
46007016	For how do you know , O wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , O husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46007017	But , as the Lord has allotted to each , let each go on living as when God called him . So I prescribe in all the churches .
46007018	Was any one already circumcised when called ? Let him not efface it . Was any one called when uncircumcised ? Let him not become circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God is all .
46007020	Let each stay in that condition in which he was called .
46007021	Were you called when a slave ? Let it not trouble you . On the contrary , even if you can become free , take it in preference .
46007022	For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's freedman . Just so the free man , when called , is the slave of Christ .
46007023	You were bought with a price . Do not become slaves of men .
46007024	Let each one , brethren , stay in that condition in which he was called , close to God .
46007025	In regard to unmarried women I have no command of the Lord , but I give my opinion as one who through the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy .
46007026	I think then that this is an excellent thing on account of the present distress — that it is an excellent thing for a person to be unmarried .
46007027	Have you been bound to a wife ? Seek not release . Have you been freed from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
46007028	But even if you marry , you have not sinned . Even if a maiden marries , she has not sinned . But such will have trouble in the flesh , and I would spare you .
46007029	But this I say , brethren : The time is shortened . For what remains let those who have wives be as if they had none ,
46007030	and those who weep as if they wept not , and those who rejoice as if they rejoiced not , and those who buy as if they possessed nothing ,
46007031	and those who use the world as if not overusing it . For the present order of this world is passing away .
46007032	I wish you to be free from worry . The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord — how be may please the Lord .
46007033	The married man is anxious about the things of the world — how he may please his wife ,
46007034	and his interest is divided . So the unmarried woman or the maiden is anxious about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy in body and spirit . But the married woman is anxious about the things of the world — how she may please her husband .
46007035	This I say for your benefit , not to throw a noose over you , but to promote decorum and constant devotion to the Lord without distraction .
46007036	If any one thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin , if she is ripe for marriage and there is need , let him do what he will . He does not sin . Let them marry .
46007037	He who stands firm in his heart , having no necessity , and has power over his own will and has decided in his heart to keep his virgin , will do well .
46007038	So he who marries his virgin does well , and he who does not marry her will do better .
46007039	A woman is bound as long as her husband is living . But if her husband falls asleep , she is free to marry whom she will , though only in the Lord .
46007040	But in my opinion she is happier if she stays as she is . And I think that I have the Spirit of God .
46008001	NOW as to things that have been sacrificed to idols , we know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
46008002	If any one think ; that he knows anything , he does not yet know as he ought to know .
46008003	If any one loves God , he is known by him .
46008004	Regarding the eating of things that have been sacrificed to idols , then , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no God but one .
46008005	And though there are so-called gods in heaven and on earth , for there are gods many and lords many ,
46008006	still to us there is one God the Father , of whom are all things and we for him , and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things and we through him .
46008007	But all have not this knowledge . Some , having been accustomed to idols up to the present time , eat the food as a sacrifice to an idol , and their conscience being weak is stained .
46008008	But food does not bring us near to God , for neither do we lose by not eating nor gain by eating .
46008009	But be careful that this power of yours may not become a stumbling block to the weak .
46008010	For if any one sees you who have knowledge reclining at table in an idol's temple , will not the conscience of that weak one be emboldened to eat things that have been sacrificed to idols ?
46008011	Thus the weak man is ruined by your knowledge — the brother for whom Christ died .
46008012	So sinning against the brethren and wounding their weak consciences you sin against Christ .
46008013	Therefore if food makes my brother stumble I will not eat meat while the world stands , for fear of making my brother stumble .
46009001	AM I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
46009002	If to others I am not an apostle , certainly I am to you . For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	My defence to those who criticize me is this :
46009004	Have we not the right to eat and drink ?
46009005	Have we not the right to take about with us a sister as wife , as the rest of the apostles do and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas ?
46009006	Or am I only , and Barnabas , without the right not to do manual labor ?
46009007	Who ever serves as a soldier and supplies his own pay and rations ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it ? Who keeps a flock and does not drink any of the milk of the flock ?
46009008	Am I saying these things from a man's point of view or does not the Law also say them ?
46009009	For in the Law of Moses it is written , " You shall not muzzle an ox when he is treading out grain . " Is God thinking of the oxen ?
46009010	or does he say this wholly for our sakes ? For our sakes ; for it was written because the plowman ought to plow in hope and the thresher ought to thresh in hope of having a share .
46009011	If we sowed for you things of the spirit , is it a great matter if we reap your things of the flesh ?
46009012	If others share this right over you , do not we still more ? But we have not used this right . No , we endure all things in order not to cause any hindrance to the good news of Christ .
46009013	Do you not know that those who do the work of the Temple eat the things that come from the Temple , and those who minister at the altar share with the altar ?
46009014	So the Lord has directed that those who proclaim the good news shall have their living from the good news .
46009015	But I have used none of these rights and I am not writing this in order that it may be done in my case . For it would be better for me to die — No one shall make my boast an empty one !
46009016	For although I tell the good news I have nothing to boast of . For a necessity is laid upon me . Alas for me if I do not tell the good news !
46009017	If I do it voluntarily I have a reward , but if reluctantly , I have been charged with a responsibility .
46009018	What then is my reward ? That in telling the good news I make the good news free , and do not take full advantage of my rights in the good news .
46009019	For though I am free from all I have enslaved myself to all that I may gain the more .
46009020	I became to the Jews a Jew , to gain the Jews ; to those under law as under law , though not myself under law , to gain those who are under law .
46009021	To those without law , I became as without law , though not without the law of God and under the law of Christ , to gain those who are without law .
46009022	To the weak I became weak to gain the weak . To all men I became all things in order by all means to save some .
46009023	I do all things for the sake of the good news that I may become a partner with it .
46009024	Do you not know that those who run in a stadium all run , yet one gets the prize ? Run so as to win .
46009025	Every one who contends in the games practices self-restraint in all things . They do it to win a fading crown , but we for an unfading one .
46009026	Thus I run with no uncertain goal : thus I strike , not as if pounding the air .
46009027	On the contrary , I maul and master my body so that I may not , after preaching to others , become myself unable to stand the test .
46010001	I DO not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea
46010002	and all received baptism in the cloud and in the sea ,
46010003	and all ate the same spiritual food
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
46010005	But with the most of them God was not well pleased . For they were strewn in the desert .
46010006	These things happened as warnings for us , that we may not be eager for evil things as they were eager .
46010007	Be not idolaters , as some of them were , as it is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to dance . "
46010008	Nor let us be unchaste , as some of them were and twenty-three thousand fell dead in one day .
46010009	Nor let us try the patience of the Lord , as some of them tried him and were destroyed by serpents .
46010010	Nor murmur , as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer .
46010011	These things happened to those people as warnings and they were written for the instruction of us to whom the closing events of the ages have come .
46010012	So let him who thinks that he is standing beware of falling .
46010013	No trial has taken you but what belongs to human nature . God is faithful and he will not let you be tried beyond your power , but will make , with the trial , a way of escape so that you can endure it .
46010014	Therefore , my beloved , shun idolatry .
46010015	I speak as to thoughtful men . Judge for yourselves what I am saying .
46010016	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not a fellowship in the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not a fellowship in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Because there is one bread we though many are one body ; for we all partake of the one bread .
46010018	Look at Israel according to the flesh ; are not those who eat of the sacrifice partakers of the altar ?
46010019	What then am I saying ? That meat sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything ?
46010020	But I say that what they sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God . And I would not have you become partakers with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
46010022	Or are we arousing the jealousy of the Lord ? Are we stronger than he ?
46010023	All things are lawful , but not all are beneficial . All things are lawful , but not all build up character .
46010024	Let no one seek his own interest , but the interest of others .
46010025	Everything that is sold in market eat , raising no questions of conscience .
46010026	For " the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof . "
46010027	If any one of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go , eat whatever is set before you , raising no questions of conscience .
46010028	But if any one says to you , " This is meat that has been sacrificed , " do not eat , for the sake of him who mentioned it and for conscience ' sake —
46010029	conscience , I say , not yours , but the other man's . For why is my liberty judged by the conscience of another ?
46010030	If I partake with thanksgiving , why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks ?
46010031	Therefore , if you eat or if you drink or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
46010032	Cause no offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God ,
46010033	as I also in all things accommodate myself to all men , not seeking my own interest but that of the many , in order that they may be saved .
46011001	IMITATE me as I imitate Christ .
46011002	I praise you because you remember me in all things and hold firmly the traditions as I passed them on to you .
46011003	I wish you to know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of a woman is her husband , and the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man praying or prophesying with his head draped dishonors his head .
46011005	But every woman praying or prophesying bareheaded dishonors her head . For it is one and the same as if she had her head shaved .
46011006	For if a woman is not covered , then let her cut off her hair . But if it is a shame to a woman to cut off her hair or to shave , let her veil herself .
46011007	For a man has no need to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God . But the woman is the glory of man .
46011008	For man was not from woman , but woman from man ,
46011009	for man was not formed for woman , but woman for man .
46011010	Therefore , the woman ought to have a badge of authority on her head because of the angels .
46011011	Yet neither is woman without man nor man without woman in the Lord .
46011012	For as woman is from man so is man through woman , but all things from God .
46011013	Decide for yourselves : is it becoming for a woman to pray to God unveiled ?
46011014	Does not Nature herself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ,
46011015	but that if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her ? Because the hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	But if any one cares to be contentious , we have no such custom , nor have the churches of God .
46011017	In giving the following directions I do not praise you , because you do not assemble for the better , but for the worse .
46011018	For , in the first place , I hear that when you assemble as a church there are parties among you , and to some extent I believe it .
46011019	For there must be parties among you in order that it may become plain who are worthy of approval .
46011020	When , therefore , you assemble it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper .
46011021	For in eating each one tries to get his own supper first and one is hungry and another is drunken .
46011022	Have you not homes to eat and drink in ? Or do you mean to show contempt for the church of God and put to shame those who have no homes ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? For this I do not praise you .
46011023	For I received from the Lord that which I passed on to you that the Lord Jesus , on the night in which he was betrayed , took bread ,
46011024	and when he had given thanks he broke it and said , " This is my body which is broken for you . Do this in memory of me . "
46011025	In like manner he took also the cup after supper , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink it , in memory of me . "
46011026	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord's death , until he comes .
46011027	Therefore , whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
46011029	For he who eats and drinks eats and drinks condemnation to himself , if he does not honor the Lord's body .
46011030	For this reason many are weak and sickly among you and a number are asleep .
46011031	If we judged ourselves we should not be judged .
46011032	But when we are judged by the Lord , we are disciplined in order that we may not be condemned along with the world .
46011033	So then , my brethren , when you assemble to eat , wait for one another .
46011034	If any one is hungry , let him eat at home , that your assembling may not bring condemnation on you . The other matters I will arrange when I come .
46012001	CONCERNING spiritual things , brethren , I do not wish you to be ignorant .
46012002	For you know that when you were Gentiles you were led away after the dumb idols just as might happen .
46012003	Therefore I inform you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says , " Jesus is accursed , " and no one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " except in the Holy Spirit .
46012004	There are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit .
46012005	And there are varieties of service , but the same Lord .
46012006	And there are varieties of products , but the same God who produces all things in all .
46012007	To each one is given some manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable .
46012008	To one are given , through the Spirit , words of wisdom , to another words of knowledge by the same Spirit ,
46012009	to another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by the same Spirit ,
46012010	to another works of power , to another prophecy , to another the discernment of spirits , to another varieties of tongues , to another interpretation of tongues .
46012011	One and the same Spirit produces all of these gifts , distributing to each one individually as he will .
46012012	For as the body is one and yet has many members , and all the members of the body , though many , are one body , so also is Christ .
46012013	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free , and were all made to drink of one Spirit .
46012014	For the body is not one member , but many .
46012015	If the foot says , " Because I am not a hand I am not of the body , " it is not for that reason not of the body .
46012016	And if the ear says , " Because I am not an eye I am not of the body , " it is not for that reason not of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where would be the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where would be the smelling ?
46012018	But now God has placed the members each one of them in the body as he pleased .
46012019	If all were one member , where would be the body ?
46012020	But now the members are many , but the body is one .
46012021	And the eye cannot say to the hand , " I have no need of you , " or the head to the feet , " I have no need of you . "
46012022	Indeed , much more those members of the body that seem to be the weaker are necessary ,
46012023	and those that we deem the less honorable parts of the body we surround with greater honor and our uncomely parts have additional dignity ,
46012024	while our comely parts have no need . But God has organized the body , giving greater honor to the part that lacks ,
46012025	that there may be no discord in the body , but that the members may have a common concern for one another .
46012026	And if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it ; if a member is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
46012027	You are the body of Christ and individually members .
46012028	God placed some in the church first as apostles , secondly as prophets , thirdly as teachers , then miracle-workers , then those with gifts of healing , helpers , administrators , speakers of different kinds of tongues .
46012029	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all miracle-workers ?
46012030	Do all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	Seek earnestly for the greater gifts ; and yet I will show you a way that surpasses all .
46013001	IF I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	And if I have the power of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but have not love , I am nothing .
46013003	And if I distribute all that I have to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but have not love , it profits me nothing .
46013004	Love is longsuffering , love is kind , is not jealous , love does not boast , is not conceited ,
46013005	does not behave unbecomingly , does not seek her own interest , is not irritable , does not count up her wrongs ,
46013006	does not rejoice in wickedness , but rejoices with the truth ,
46013007	excuses all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
46013008	Love never fails ; but if there are prophetic powers , they will become useless ; if there are tongues , they will cease ; if there is knowledge , it will become useless .
46013009	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ,
46013010	but when the perfect comes what is in part will become useless .
46013011	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . Since I have become a man , I have no use for childish things .
46013012	For as yet we are looking at puzzling reflections in a mirror , but then face to face . As yet I know in part , but then I shall know fully , as I have been fully known .
46013013	But now faith , hope , love — these three — endure . And the greatest of these is love .
46014001	SEEK love earnestly , be eager for spiritual gifts , but most to prophesy .
46014002	For he who speaks with a tongue speaks not to men , but to God . For no one understands , and he speaks mysteries in the Spirit .
46014003	But he who prophesies speaks to men what will build up , encourage , and comfort .
46014004	He who speaks in a tongue builds himself up , but he who prophesies builds up the church .
46014005	I wish you all to speak with tongues , but I wish more to have you prophesy . He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues , unless he interprets so that the church may receive upbuilding .
46014006	Now , brethren , if I come to you speaking with tongues , what benefit will I be to you unless I speak to you in a revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching .
46014007	Inanimate things that give a sound , such as the flute or harp , — unless they give a distinction in the sounds , how will it be known what is being played on flute or harp ?
46014008	If the trumpet gives a dubious sound , who will prepare himself for battle ?
46014009	And so you , if you do not give by the tongue words easy to understand , how will it be known what is said ? For you will be talking into the air .
46014010	There are , it may be , so many kinds of languages in the world , and none without meaning .
46014011	If then I do not know the meaning of the language , I shall be a barbarian to him who is speaking , and he will be a barbarian to me .
46014012	And so you , since you are eager for spiritual gifts , seek to abound in what will build up the church .
46014013	Therefore let him who speaks with a tongue pray to interpret .
46014014	For if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays , but my understanding is unfruitful .
46014015	What then ? I will pray with the spirit and with the understanding . I will sing with the spirit and with the understanding .
46014016	If you thank God with the spirit , how shall he who fills the place of the ordinary man say Amen to your thanksgiving ? For he does not know what you are saying .
46014017	You give thanks excellently , but the other is not helped by it .
46014018	I thank God that I speak with tongues more than any of you .
46014019	But in church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so as to instruct others , than to speak ten thousand words in a tongue .
46014020	Brethren , be not children in intelligence , but be babes in wickedness . In intelligence be adults .
46014021	In the Law it is written , " By men of strange speech and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people , and not even thus will they listen to me , says the Lord . "
46014022	So then tongues are for a sign not to believers , but to unbelievers , and prophecy is not for unbelievers , but for believers .
46014023	If therefore the whole church assembles and all speak with tongues and ordinary men or unbelievers come in , will they not say that you are insane ?
46014024	But if all prophesy and any unbeliever or ordinary man comes in , he is convinced by all , he is judged by all ,
46014025	the secrets of his heart become manifest , and so falling on his face he worships God , declaring that God is really among you .
46014026	What then , brethren ? When you assemble each one has a psalm , has a teaching , has a revelation , has a tongue , has an interpretation . Let all things be done for the upbuilding of character .
46014027	If any one speaks with a tongue , let it be two , or at the most three , at a time and in turn and let one interpret .
46014028	If there is no interpreter , let the man keep silent in church and let him speak to himself and to God .
46014029	Of the prophets let two or three speak and let the others reflect .
46014030	If a revelation comes to another who is sitting by , let the first become silent .
46014031	For you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged .
46014032	The spirits of the prophets are under the control of the prophets .
46014033	For God is not a God of confusion , but of peace . As in all the churches of the holy ,
46014034	let the women be silent in your assemblies . For it is not allowed to them to speak ; but let them be in subjection as also the Law says .
46014035	If they wish to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home . For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church .
46014036	Did the message of God come out from you or did it come to you alone ?
46014037	If any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual , let him recognize that what I am writing to you is the command of the Lord .
46014038	But if any one does not know , he is himself unknown .
46014039	So then , my brethren , seek earnestly to prophesy and do not hinder speaking with tongues .
46014040	Let all things be done becomingly and in order .
46015001	LET me recall to your minds , brethren , the good news which I announced to you and which you accepted , in which also you stand ,
46015002	through which also you are being saved , if you hold fast the message that I announced to you , unless your faith was thoughtless .
46015003	For among the first things I passed on to you what I had received , that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
46015004	and that he was buried , and that he was raised on the third day , according to the Scriptures ,
46015005	and that he was seen by Cephas , then by the twelve ,
46015006	then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once , of whom the most are still living , but some have fallen asleep ,
46015007	then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
46015008	Last of all , as if to one untimely born , he appeared also to me .
46015009	For I am the least of the apostles and am not fit to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace toward me was not without result , but I labored more abundantly than all of them , yet not I , but the grace of God that was with me .
46015011	Whether then it was I or they , so we proclaim and so you believed .
46015012	But if Christ is proclaimed — that he has been raised from the dead — how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	If there is no resurrection of the dead , then neither has Christ been raised .
46015014	If Christ has not been raised , then our proclamation is an empty thing and your faith is an empty thing .
46015015	And we are found false witnesses of God because we testified regarding God that he raised up Christ , whom he did not raise if the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , neither has Christ been raised .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is futile , you are still in your sins .
46015018	Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
46015019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most pitiable .
46015020	But now Christ has been raised from the dead , the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep .
46015021	For since by a man came death , by a man also came resurrection of the dead .
46015022	For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
46015023	But each in his own order . The first-fruit is Christ , then those who are Christ's , at his coming .
46015024	Then will be the end when he delivers up the kingship to God his Father , when he has defeated every archangel and authority and power .
46015025	For he must be king until he " puts all his enemies under his feet . "
46015026	The last enemy to be defeated will be death .
46015027	For " he subjected all things under his feet . " But when it says , " all things have been subjected , " it is plain that it means all things except God who subjected all things to him .
46015028	But when all things have been subjected to him , then the Son himself will be subjected to him who subjected all things to him , that God may be all in all .
46015029	Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead do not rise at all , why are they then baptized for them ?
46015030	And why do we run risks every hour ?
46015031	I die every day , I swear it by the boast I make of you and which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .
46015032	If , humanly speaking , I fought wild beasts at Ephesus , what is my gain ? If the dead do not rise , " let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die . "
46015033	Do not be led astray ; " bad associations corrupt good morals . "
46015034	Return to soberness and cease to sin , for some are ignorant of God . I say it to your shame .
46015035	But some one will say , How are the dead raised , and with what sort of bodies do they come ?
46015036	Thoughtless man ! What you yourself sow does not come to life unless it dies .
46015037	And what you sow is not the body that will come , but a mere grain , perhaps of wheat or of something else .
46015038	But God gives it a body as he has pleased , and to each kind of seed a body of its own .
46015039	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another flesh of birds , and another flesh of fishes .
46015040	There are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial . But the glory of the celestial is of one kind and the glory of the terrestrial is of another .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars . For star differs from star in glory .
46015042	So also will be the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in decay ; it is raised imperishable .
46015043	It is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power .
46015044	It is sown an animal body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is an animal body there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	Just as it is written , " The first man Adam became a living animal , " the last Adam became a lifegiving spirit .
46015046	But the spiritual is not first , but the animal , then the spiritual .
46015047	The first man was from the earth , earthly ; the second man is the Lord from heaven .
46015048	As is the earthly man such are also those who are earthly , and as is the heavenly man such are also those who are heavenly .
46015049	And as we have borne the image of the earthly man , we shall bear the image of the heavenly man .
46015050	But I say this , brethren , flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God , nor will decay inherit imperishability .
46015051	I am telling you a mystery . We shall not all fall asleep , but we shall all be transformed ,
46015052	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet-call . For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we shall be transformed .
46015053	For this perishable must clothe itself with imperishability , and this mortal must clothe itself with immortality .
46015054	When this perishable has clothed itself with imperishability and this mortal has clothed itself with immortality , then will come to pass the word that is written , " Death has been swallowed up in victory .
46015055	O Death , where is thy victory ? O Death , where is thy sting ? "
46015056	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the Law .
46015057	But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !
46015058	So then , my beloved brethren , be firm , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord ; since you know that your labor is not fruitless in the Lord .
46016001	REGARDING the collection for the holy , as I arranged for the churches of Galatia , you must do the same .
46016002	On the first day of the week let each of you lay up at home something according as he may be prospering , in order that no collections may be going on when I come .
46016003	When I come , whatever persons you may approve , I will send with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	And if it seems best for me to go , they shall go with me .
46016005	I shall come to you alter I pass through Macedonia . For I shall pass through Macedonia
46016006	and perhaps I shall make some stay with you or pass the winter with you , so that you may send me forward wherever I may be going .
46016007	I do not wish to see you now merely in passing , for I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord permits .
46016008	I shall remain in Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	for a great and effective door has been opened to me , and there are many opponents .
46016010	If Timothy comes , see to it that he becomes free from fear in his relations to you . For he is doing the Lord's work , just as I am .
46016011	So let no one think him of no account . Send him forward in peace on his journey to me , for I am expecting him with the brethren .
46016012	As to Apollos our brother , I urged him strongly to go to you with the brethren . But it was not at all his will to go now , but he will come when it is convenient .
46016013	Watch , stand firmly in the faith , be manly , be strong ,
46016014	let all that you do be done in love .
46016015	I beg you , brethren — you know the household of Stephanas , that it is the first-fruit of Achaia and they have devoted themselves to serving the holy —
46016016	I beg you to show deference to such and to every fellow worker and laborer .
46016017	I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus , because they made up for my lack of you .
46016018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours . Appreciate such men .
46016019	The churches of Asia send you their greetings . Aquila and Prisca with the church in their house greet you heartily in the Lord .
46016020	All the brethren send greetings to you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	Here is the greeting of me , Paul , by my own hand .
46016022	If any one does not love the Lord , let him be accursed ! Maran atha !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus .
47001001	PAUL , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy the brother , to the church of God that is in Corinth with all the holy that are in all Achaia :
47001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
47001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of loving kindness and the God of all encouragement ,
47001004	who encourages us in every distress so that we may be able to encourage those who are in every distress by the encouragement by which we ourselves have been encouraged by God .
47001005	Because as the sufferings of Christ are abundant in our case , so through Christ our encouragement is abundant .
47001006	But if we are in distress , it is for your encouragement and salvation . If we are encouraged , it is for your encouragement which is effective in the endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer .
47001007	Our hope is strong regarding you , since we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so you are of the encouragement .
47001008	For we do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , regarding the distress that came on us in Asia — that we were exceedingly weighed down , beyond our strength , so that we despaired even of life .
47001009	Indeed we have the sentence of death within ourselves , that our trust may not rest on ourselves , but on God who raises the dead .
47001010	He delivered us from such a death and will deliver , and we have hope in him that he will go on delivering ,
47001011	while you help by your prayers for us , so that from many persons thanksgiving may arise for the gift granted to us through the prayers of many for us .
47001012	For this is what we boast of , the witness of our conscience that in holiness , and sincerity before God , not in fleshly wisdom , but in the grace of God , we have lived in the world and especially toward you .
47001013	For we are not writing to you anything but what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will acknowledge to the end ,
47001014	as you have partly acknowledged it about us , that we are your ground of boasting and you are ours on the day of our Lord Jesus .
47001015	With this confidence I intended to come to you first , so that you might have a second favor ,
47001016	by my visiting you on the way to Macedonia and again coming back from Macedonia to you and being sped by you on my way toward Juda .
47001017	When I was intending this , did I show fickleness ? Or do I plan what I plan according to the flesh , so that I may say yes , yes , and no , no ?
47001018	As God is faithful , my word to you is not yes and no .
47001019	For the Son of God , Christ Jesus , who was proclaimed among you by us — myself and Silvanus and Timothy — was not yes and no , but in him was yes .
47001020	For all the promises of God , however many , have their yes in him . Therefore also through him is the Amen to the glory of God through us .
47001021	It is God who makes us and you steadfast to Christ , and has anointed us
47001022	and sealed us and has given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts .
47001023	I call God as a witness against my soul that in order to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth .
47001024	Not that we are lords over your faith , but fellow workers sharing your joy , for you are standing firm in the faith .
47002001	BUT I decided this in my own mind , not to come again to you in sorrow .
47002002	For if I grieve you , who is there to cheer me except those who are grieved by me ?
47002003	I am writing this very thing so that I may not come and have grief from those who ought to make me glad , for I am confident in regard to all of you that my joy is yours .
47002004	For out of great distress and pain of heart I am writing with many tears , not that you may be grieved , but that you may know the love that I have beyond measure for you .
47002005	But if any one has caused grief , he has grieved not me , but to some extent — not to be too severe — all of you .
47002006	Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority ,
47002007	so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and encourage him , that such a one may not be swallowed up in excessive grief .
47002008	Therefore I beg you to assure him of your love .
47002009	Because for this purpose I am writing , that I may know your tested character , whether you are obedient in everything .
47002010	To whomever you forgive anything I also forgive it , and what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , it was for your sake in the sight of Christ ,
47002011	that Satan may not take advantage of us , for we are not ignorant of his purposes .
47002012	When I came to Troas for the good news of Christ and a door had been opened for me in the Lord ,
47002013	I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother , but bidding them farewell I came away to Macedonia .
47002014	Thanks be to God who always leads us in his triumph in Christ and spreads through us the sweet odor of the knowledge of him in every place .
47002015	For we are for God a sweet odor of Christ — in the saved and in the perishing .
47002016	To the latter an odor from death to death , to the former an odor from life to life . And who is competent for this ?
47002017	For we are not , like the most , adulterating the message of God for gain , but in sincerity , as from God , in the presence of God , we speak in Christ .
47003001	ARE we beginning again to recommend ourselves ? Do we need , as some do , letters of recommendation to you or from you ?
47003002	You are our letter , written in our hearts , known and read by all men ,
47003003	evidently a letter of Christ delivered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God , not on stone tablets , but on tablets that are hearts of flesh .
47003004	We have such confidence through Christ toward God .
47003005	Not that of ourselves we are fit to reason out anything as from ourselves , but our fitness is from God ,
47003006	who has fitted us to be servants of a new covenant , not of the letter , but of the spirit . For the letter kills , but the spirit gives life .
47003007	If the service that brought death , engraved in letters on stones , came in glory , so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face — that fading glory —
47003008	how much more glorious will not the service of the Spirit be ?
47003009	For if the service that brought condemnation was glory , much more will the service that brings righteousness surpass in glory .
47003010	For what was made so glorious is in a way no longer glorious compared with the glory that surpasses it .
47003011	For if what was to be ended came in glory , much more glorious must be that which is enduring .
47003012	With such a hope then we speak with great frankness ,
47003013	and are not like Moses , who used to put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel might not see when the vanishing glory ended ;
47003014	but their thinking was dulled . For to this day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read ; because it is done away only in Christ .
47003015	To this day when Moses is read the veil lies on their hearts ;
47003016	" but when they turn to the Lord the veil is taken away . "
47003017	The Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty .
47003018	And we all , with unveiled face , reflecting the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same likeness from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord .
47004001	THEREFORE , having this service through God's mercy , we are not downhearted ,
47004002	but we have renounced shameful secret things , not living in craftiness nor adulterating God's message , but by the openness of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God .
47004003	If our good news is veiled , it is veiled to those who are going to ruin ,
47004004	in whom the god of this world has blinded the thinking of the unbelieving so that the light of the glorious good news of Christ , who is the image of God , may not shine in .
47004005	For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus ' sake .
47004006	Because it is the God who said , " Light shall shine out of darkness , " who has shone in our hearts bringing the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in earthen jars , that the surpassing power may be God's and not ours —
47004008	in every way distressed , but not reduced to straits , perplexed , but not in despair ,
47004009	persecuted , but not forsaken , cast down , but not destroyed ,
47004010	always bearing about in our bodies the death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus may be manifest in our bodies .
47004011	For we , though living , are always delivered up to death for Jesus ' sake , that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh .
47004012	So death works in us , but life in you .
47004013	Having the same spirit of faith , as it is written , " I believed , therefore I spoke , " we too believe and therefore speak ,
47004014	knowing that he who raised up Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus and place us in his presence with you .
47004015	For all things are for your sake , that grace abounding through many may overflow in thanksgiving to the glory of God .
47004016	Therefore we are not downhearted , but even if our outward man is wasting away , yet our inward man is renewed day by day .
47004017	For our momentary and light distress is working out for us a far surpassing and eternal weight of glory
47004018	while we contemplate not the things that are seen , but the things unseen . For the things that are seen are transient , but the things unseen are eternal .
47005001	FOR we know that if this tent , our earthly home , is thrown down , we have a building of God , a home not made by hands , eternal in the heavens .
47005002	For in this we sigh in earnest desire to put on our dwelling that comes from heaven ,
47005003	since if we put that on we shall not be found naked .
47005004	For while we are in this tent we sigh being burdened , not that we wish to be unclothed , but to put on the other , that what is mortal may be swallowed up in life .
47005005	He who has prepared us for this very thing is God , and he has given to us the pledge of the Spirit .
47005006	So being always of good courage and knowing that while living at home in the body we are living in a foreign land away from the Lord —
47005007	for we walk by faith , not by sight —
47005008	I say we are of good courage and wish rather to live in the land foreign to the body and be at home with the Lord .
47005009	Therefore also we are ambitious to be pleasing to him , whether at home with him or in this foreign land .
47005010	For we must all appear as we truly are before the judgment seat of Christ , that each may receive the award for what he has done with his body , according to his actions , whether good or bad .
47005011	Knowing , therefore , the fear of the Lord , we are persuading men . What we are is plain to God , and I hope that it is also plain to your consciences .
47005012	We are not recommending ourselves again to you , but giving occasion to you for boasting on our behalf , that you may have it to use against those who boast of appearances and not of heart .
47005013	For if we were out of our minds it was for God , and if we are sane it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Christ impels us , convinced of this , that if one died for all , then all died ,
47005015	and he died for all that the living may no longer live for themselves , but for him who died for them and was raised again .
47005016	So we , from now on , know no man according to the flesh . Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
47005017	So if any one is in Christ he is a new creature . The old things have passed away , they have become new .
47005018	And all things are from God , who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given to us the service of reconciliation —
47005019	to proclaim that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not counting against men their sins , and that he has committed to us the message of reconciliation .
47005020	So we are ambassadors for Christ , as if God were appealing to you through us . We pray you on Christ's behalf to be reconciled to God .
47005021	Him who knew no sin God made sin for our sake that we might become the righteousness of God in him .
47006001	AS God's fellow workers we also beg you not to receive his grace fruitlessly .
47006002	For he says , " At a favorable time I heard you and on a day of salvation I helped you . " Now is a particularly favorable time , now is a day of salvation .
47006003	We give no occasion for stumbling to any one that our service may not be blamed ,
47006004	but in everything we commend ourselves as God's servants in great patience , in distresses , in necessities , in hardships ,
47006005	in floggings , in prisons , in riots , in toils , in sleepless nights , in fastings ,
47006006	with purity , with knowledge , with long-suffering , with kindness , with the Holy Spirit , with sincere love ,
47006007	with the message of truth , with the power of God ; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and the left ,
47006008	by honor and shame , by slander and praise ; as deceivers yet true ,
47006009	as unknown yet well known , as dying and yet we are living , as chastised yet not put to death ,
47006010	as sorrowful yet always rejoicing , as poor yet making many rich , as having nothing yet owning all things .
47006011	Our mouth is open to you , Corinthians , our heart expands itself .
47006012	You find no narrowness in us , the narrowness is in your own sympathies .
47006013	As a fair return , I am speaking as to my children , let your hearts expand .
47006014	Do not be yoked up , like unmatched animals , with unbelievers . For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness , or what fellowship has light with darkness ,
47006015	or what harmony has Christ with Belial , or what share has a believer with an unbeliever ?
47006016	What agreement has the Temple of God with idols ? For we are the Temple of the living God , as God said , " I will dwell in them and walk among them , and I will be their God and they shall be my people .
47006017	Therefore come out from the midst of them and be separate , says the Lord , and do not touch an unclean thing , and I will receive you
47006018	and will be a Father to you and you shall be sons and daughters to me , says the Lord , the Ruler of all . "
47007001	HAVING then these promises , beloved , let us purify ourselves from every defilement of flesh or spirit , in reverence for God making our holiness complete .
47007002	Make room for us in your hearts . We have wronged no one ; we have injured no one ; we have taken advantage of no one .
47007003	I am not saying this to condemn you , for I have already said that you have such a place in our hearts that we are ready to die with you or to live with you .
47007004	Great is my frankness in speaking to you ; great is my boasting of you ; I am filled with encouragement , running over with joy at every distress of ours .
47007005	For since we came to Macedonia our flesh has had no rest , but we have been distressed in every way , conflicts without , fears within .
47007006	But God , who encourages the depressed , encouraged us by the coming of Titus ,
47007007	and not by his coming only , but also by the encouragement by which he was encouraged about you . He told us of your longing for me , your lamentation , your zeal in my behalf , so that I rejoice the more .
47007008	For if I grieved you in my letter I do not regret it , though I did regret it , seeing that that letter grieved you even for a time ,
47007009	but I am glad now , not that you were grieved , but that your grief led to a change of heart . You were grieved as God approves so that you should in nothing suffer loss from us .
47007010	For such grief as God approves works a change of heart leading to salvation and is never to be regretted . But the grief of the world results in death .
47007011	Notice this very grieving as God approves , how great earnestness resulted from it in your case , what effort to defend yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , what just punishment ! In everything you showed yourselves blameless in the matter .
47007012	So although I wrote to you , I did it not for the sake of him who did the wrong , nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong , but that your earnestness for us might be made plain to you before God .
47007013	On this account we have been encouraged . In addition to this encouragement of ours , we rejoiced very much more over the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all ,
47007014	for if I have made any boast regarding you I have not been put to shame , but as we spoke everything in truth to you so our boasting over Titus turned out the truth .
47007015	And his affections go out more strongly to you when he remembers the obedience of you all , how with reverence and trembling you received him .
47007016	I am glad to be in every respect of good courage regarding you .
47008001	I MUST tell you , brethren , of the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia ,
47008002	that in a great trial of distress their abundant joy and their deep poverty have abounded in the wealth of their liberality .
47008003	For according to their ability , I bear witness , and beyond their ability , of their own accord ,
47008004	with great urgency they begged of us the favor of fellowship in the service for the holy ,
47008005	and this not as we had hoped , but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God .
47008006	Therefore we encouraged Titus that as he had begun so he should complete this grace among you .
47008007	But as you excel in every way , in faith and speech and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love you learned from us , be sure to excel in this grace also .
47008008	I speak not by way of command , but testing the genuineness of your love by the earnestness of others .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor , that you by his poverty might become rich .
47008010	In this I give my opinion , for this is advantageous for you , since a year ago you were first to begin not only the doing but the wanting to do anything .
47008011	But now complete the doing , that as there was a readiness in willing so there may be a completion according to your means .
47008012	For if there is first the readiness , a gift is acceptable according to what a man has , not according to what he has not .
47008013	I do not mean that others shall have relief and you shall have trouble ,
47008014	but by equality at the present time your abundance may supply their need so that their abundance may come at your need — that there may be equality ,
47008015	as it is written , " He who gathered much had nothing over and he who gathered little had no lack . "
47008016	Thanks be to God who puts into the heart of Titus the same interest in you .
47008017	For he welcomed our appeal , but being unusually interested comes to you of his own choice .
47008018	With him we are sending the brother whose praise for service to the good news has spread through all the churches ,
47008019	and not only that , but he was appointed by the churches as our fellow traveler in this gracious errand carried out by us to the glory of the Lord himself and by our own eager desire .
47008020	We are taking care that no one shall blame us for our administration of this bountiful fund ,
47008021	for we are providing arrangements honorable , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
47008022	We are sending along with them also our brother whose earnestness we have tested many times in many ways , and who is now especially earnest because of his great confidence in you .
47008023	If any one asks about Titus , he is my intimate friend and fellow worker for you . If it is our brethren , they are the messengers of the churches , the glory of Christ .
47008024	Show them in the sight of the churches your love and the ground of our boasting to them about you .
47009001	REGARDING the service to the holy , it is superfluous for me to write to you .
47009002	For I know your readiness and I am boasting about you to the Macedonians , that Achaia was ready a year ago , and your zeal has stimulated the most of them .
47009003	I am sending the brethren that our boasting about you may not be proved in this matter an empty boast , so that you may be ready as I have said ,
47009004	and if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we , not to say you , may not be made ashamed of this confidence .
47009005	So I think it necessary to urge the brethren to go on in advance to you and prepare before-hand your promised gift , that it may be ready as a gift and not as if extorted .
47009006	Remember this , he who sows sparingly will reap sparingly and he who sows bountifully will reap bountifully .
47009007	Let each give as he has purposed in his heart , not grudgingly nor of necessity , for God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	God is able to make every blessing abound for you so that having in everything always all that you need , you may abound in every good work ,
47009009	as it is written , " He scattered , he gave to the poor , his righteousness endures forever . "
47009010	He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and make abundant your seed and will increase the fruits of your righteousness .
47009011	You will be enriched in everything so that you will have all liberality which through our agency causes thanksgiving to God .
47009012	For the performance of this sacred service not only supplies the needs of the holy , but also overflows to God in many thanksgivings .
47009013	By the proof afforded by this service men are led to glorify God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of Christ , and for the liberality of your contributions toward them and toward all .
47009014	In their prayers in your behalf they pour out their longing love for you because of the surpassing grace of God that is upon you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift !
47010001	I MYSELF , Paul , beg you by the gentleness and sweet reasonableness of Christ — I who " to your face am humble when among you , but when absent am bold toward you " —
47010002	I pray that I may not when present have to be bold with the confidence with which I expect to show my courage against some who think of us as living according to the flesh .
47010003	For although living in the flesh we do not carry on our warfare according to the flesh ,
47010004	for the weapons of our warfare are not weapons of the flesh , but powerful under God for the destruction of fortresses .
47010005	We overthrow reasonings and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God , and take captive every thought into obedience to Christ
47010006	and are ready to take vengeance upon every disobedience when your obedience is complete .
47010007	Look at what is right before your eyes . If any one is confident that he belongs to Christ , let him again consider this regarding himself , that just as he belongs to Christ so also do we .
47010008	For if I boast somewhat excessively of our authority , which the Lord gave for building you up and not for pulling you down , I shall not be ashamed .
47010009	Let me not seem as if meaning to frighten you by letters .
47010010	Because , " His letters , " they say , " are mighty and strong , but his bodily presence is weak and his speaking amounts to nothing . "
47010011	Let such a person consider this , that what we are in words by letters when absent such we will be in deeds when present .
47010012	We do not venture to class ourselves or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves . But they , measuring themselves among themselves and comparing themselves with themselves , do not understand .
47010013	We will not boast beyond measure , but according to the measure of the measuring rod which God assigned to us , and that reaches as far as you .
47010014	For we are not stretching ourselves , as if we did not reach to you , for we were the first to reach you with the good news of Christ .
47010015	We are not boasting beyond measure in the labors of others , but we have hope that as your faith grows we may have larger influence among you according to our measure and beyond ,
47010016	so that we may tell the good news to the regions lying beyond you and not boast of things already done in some other man's territory .
47010017	" Let him who boasts boast in the Lord . "
47010018	For it is not he who commends himself that is approved , but whom the Lord commends .
47011001	O THAT you would bear with me in a little foolishness . Yes , bear with me .
47011002	For I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God , for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
47011003	But I fear that , as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning , your thoughts may be led away from sincerity and purity toward Christ .
47011004	For if some newcomer proclaims another Jesus whom we did not proclaim , or if you receive a different kind of spirit which you did not receive , or a different good news which you did not welcome , you bear with him finely .
47011005	I consider that I am in nothing inferior to the most eminent apostles .
47011006	If I am an ordinary man in speaking , still I am not in knowledge , but in everything we made that altogether clear to you .
47011007	Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself that you might be exalted , because I proclaimed to you the good news of God without pay ?
47011008	I robbed other churches by taking wages for serving you ,
47011009	and when I was with you and in need I was not a burden to any one , for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my need . In every way I kept myself from being a burden to you , and shall keep myself so .
47011010	As the truth of Christ is in me , this boast of mine shall not be stopped in the region of Achaia .
47011011	Why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows .
47011012	But what I am doing I shall do so as to cut away all ground of attack from those who wish ground , and that in what they boast of they may be found just like us .
47011013	For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no wonder , for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light .
47011015	So it is no great thing if his servants too disguise themselves as servants of righteousness . Their end will be according to their deeds .
47011016	I say again , let no one think me foolish . But , even if so , receive me as foolish , that I too may boast a little .
47011017	What I am saying I am not saying by the Lord's command , but as it were in foolishness , in this confident boasting .
47011018	Since many are boasting according to the flesh , I too will boast ,
47011019	for you who are wise bear pleasantly with the foolish .
47011020	You bear it if any one enslaves you , if any one devours you , if any one takes possession of you , if any one exalts himself , if any one strikes you in the face .
47011021	I say it with shame as if we had been weak . But in whatever any one is bold I too am bold .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they descended from Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? I superlatively — in labors beyond measure , in prisons beyond measure , in floggings excessively , in deaths often .
47011024	From Jews five times I received forty stripes less one ,
47011025	three times I was beaten with rods , once I was stoned , three times I was ship-wrecked , a night and day I have been in the deep ;
47011026	in journeys often , in perils of rivers , in perils of robbers , in perils from my own race , in perils from Gentiles , in perils in the city , in perils in the open country , in perils on the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
47011027	in toil and labor , in many a sleepless night , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
47011028	Aside , from other things there is that which weighs on me daily , anxiety for all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak and I am not weak ? Who stumbles and I am not burning ?
47011030	If there must be boasting , I will boast of the things that show my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows , he who is blessed forever , that I am not lying .
47011032	In Damascus the Governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes to arrest me ,
47011033	and through a window I was lowered in a basket and escaped from his hands .
47012001	I MUST boast , though it is unprofitable . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago — whether in the body I know not , or out of the body I know not ; God knows — such a man caught up to the third heaven .
47012003	I know such a man — whether in the body or out of the body I know not ; God knows —
47012004	that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for man to speak .
47012005	Of such a one I will boast , but of myself I will not boast except of my weaknesses .
47012006	Even if I choose to boast I shall not be foolish , for I shall speak the truth . But I guard myself that no one may think of me beyond what he sees me to be , or hears from me ,
47012007	and because of the surpassing nature of the revelations . For this reason , that I should not be puffed up , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , an angel of Satan , to torment me , so that I should not be puffed up .
47012008	Regarding this I three times begged the Lord that it might leave me .
47012009	But he has said to me , " My grace is sufficient for you ; for power is made perfect in weakness . " Most gladly then will I boast in my weaknesses , that the power of Christ may abide upon me .
47012010	Therefore I rejoice in weaknesses , in rough treatment , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ's sake ; for when I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I have become foolish ; you made me . For I ought to have been recommended by you . For in nothing have I been inferior to the most eminent apostles , even though I am nothing .
47012012	The signs of an apostle were performed among you in all patience by miracles and wonders and deeds of power .
47012013	What is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the churches except that I was not a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong .
47012014	Now this third time I am ready to come to you , and I shall not be a burden to you . For I am not seeking yours , but you . For the children ought not to lay up money for the parents , but the parents for the children .
47012015	And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls . If I love you too much , am I loved the less ?
47012016	Be that as it may , I was not a burden to you . But being crafty I caught you with cunning ?
47012017	Did I take advantage of you through any one of those I sent to you ?
47012018	I begged Titus to go , and I sent along with him the brother . Did Titus take advantage of you ? Did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps ?
47012019	Are you thinking all this while that we are defending ourselves to you ? We are speaking before God in Christ . All this , beloved , is to build you up .
47012020	For I am afraid that when I come I shall not find you such as I wish , and I myself may not be found by you such as you wish . I am afraid that there may be strife , jealousy , anger , rivalry , slanders , whisperings , conceit , disorders .
47012021	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humble me in your presence , and that I shall grieve over many of those who have been long sinning and have not repented of the impurity and unchastity and sensuality which they have practiced .
47013001	THIS third time I am coming to you . " By the evidence of two witnesses , or three , every matter shall be proved . "
47013002	Those who have been long sinning and all the rest I have forewarned and now forewarn , when I was present with you the second time and now when absent , that if I come again I shall not spare ;
47013003	since you are eager to have a test of Christ speaking in me . He is not weak toward you , but powerful among you .
47013004	He was crucified in weakness , but he is living by the power of God . And we are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God for you .
47013005	Test yourselves whether you are in the faith , put yourselves to the proof . Are you not conscious that Jesus Christ is in you ? He is , unless you cannot stand the test .
47013006	I hope that you know that we are not unable to stand the test .
47013007	I pray to God that you may do nothing evil , not in order that we may seem to stand the test , but in order that you may do the right , though we should seem unable to stand the test .
47013008	For we cannot do anything against the truth ; our power is for the truth .
47013009	We rejoice when we are weak and you are strong . This we are praying for , your all-round character .
47013010	For this reason I am writing this while absent , so that when present I may not act with severity in the use of the authority which the Lord gave me for building you up , not for pulling you down .
47013011	Now , brethren , farewell . Be fully equipped ; take courage ; be of one mind ; live in peace ; then the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All the holy send greetings .
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	PAUL an apostle — not from men or through men , but through Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised him from the dead —
48001002	and all the brethren with me , to the churches of Galatia :
48001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present wicked world according to the will of our God and Father !
48001005	To him be glory through the ages of the ages ! Amen .
48001006	I am astonished that you are so quickly changing over from him who called you by the grace of Christ to a different kind of good news ,
48001007	though it is not another good news . But there are some who are perplexing you and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ .
48001008	But even if we , or an angel from heaven , should bring you any good news different from what we did bring you , let him be accursed !
48001009	As I said before , I say now again , if any one brings you good news different from what you have received , let him be accursed !
48001010	Am I now trying to please men or God ? If I were still trying to please men I should not be Christ's servant .
48001011	For I assure you , brethren , that the good news which I brought is not of man's devising .
48001012	For neither did I receive it from man nor was I taught it through man , but through a revelation of Jesus Christ .
48001013	You have heard of my former life in Judaism , that I furiously persecuted the church of God and made havoc of it ,
48001014	and I went further in Judaism than many of my own age and race , being intensely zealous for the traditions of my forefathers .
48001015	But when he who had appointed me when I was in my mother's womb , and had called me by his grace ,
48001016	was pleased to reveal his Son in me that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles , immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood ,
48001017	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia , and came back to Damascus .
48001018	Then , after three years , I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	But I saw no other one of the apostles , though I did see James the Lord's brother .
48001020	In what I am writing to you , before God I am not lying .
48001021	Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	I was not known by face to the churches of Christ in Judaea .
48001023	Only they had heard that " he who used to persecute us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc , "
48001024	and they glorified God on my account .
48002001	THEN after fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking along Titus .
48002002	I went up by revelation , and I stated to them the good news which I proclaim among the Gentiles . But I did this privately before those who were most esteemed , that I might not be running , or have run , to no Purpose .
48002003	But even Titus , who was with me and was a Greek , was not compelled to be circumcised ,
48002004	though it was suggested on account of false brethren who had been brought in , who had crept in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , in order to enslave us .
48002005	But we did not yield in subjection to them even for an hour , that the truth of the good news might continue with you .
48002006	But from those who were esteemed to be something — whatever they were , it makes no difference to me ; God does not regard the social standing of a man — those who were most esteemed did not impart to me anything additional .
48002007	But , on the contrary , seeing that I was entrusted with the good news for the uncircumcision as Peter was for the circumcision ,
48002008	for he who had worked in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcision had worked in me for the Gentiles ,
48002009	recognizing the grace given to me , James , Cephas , and John , who were regarded as pillars , gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas , that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision .
48002010	Only they wished us to remember the poor . This very thing I also was earnest in doing .
48002011	But when Peter came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he had been justly censured .
48002012	For before certain persons came from James , he was eating with the Gentiles . But when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing those who were of the circumcision .
48002013	And the rest of the Jews practiced the same hypocrisy with him , so that even Barnabas was led off with them in their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they were not walking straight according to the truth of the good news , I said to Cephas before them all , " If you who are a Jew are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ? "
48002015	We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
48002016	knowing that a man is not declared righteous because of works of law , but through faith in Christ Jesus , we also have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be declared righteous because of faith in Christ , and not because of works of law , for because of works of law no human being will be declared righteous .
48002017	If while seeking to be declared righteous in Christ we ourselves are found sinners , is Christ then a servant of sin ? Never .
48002018	For if I am building up again what I pulled down , I show myself as a transgressor .
48002019	For I through law died to law that I might live to God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ . I am living , yet no longer I , but Christ is living in me . The life that I am now living in flesh I am living by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me .
48002021	I do not make nothing of the grace of God , for if righteousness is through law , then Christ died for nothing .
48003001	O THOUGHTLESS Galatians , who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was pictured crucified ?
48003002	Only this I wish to learn from you : Was it because of works of law that you received the Spirit , or because of hearing with faith ?
48003003	Are you so thoughtless ? After beginning with spirit are you now finishing with flesh ?
48003004	Have you suffered such things to no purpose ? — if it is to no purpose .
48003005	He who supplies to you the Spirit and works miracles among you , is he doing it because of works of law or because of hearing with faith ,
48003006	just as Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness ?
48003007	You know , then , that those who are of faith — they are children of Abraham .
48003008	For the Scripture , foreseeing that God would declare the Gentiles righteous because of faith , announced the good news in advance to Abraham , " In you all the Gentiles will be blessed . "
48003009	So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham .
48003010	For all who are of the works of law are under a curse , for it is written , " Cursed is every one who does not abide by all the precepts of the book of the Law and do them . "
48003011	But that by law no one is declared righteous before God is plain , because , " He who is righteous by faith shall live . "
48003012	But the Law is not of faith , but " He who does these things shall live by them . "
48003013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for our sake , for it is written , " Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree , "
48003014	in order that the blessing of Abraham might in Jesus Christ come on the Gentiles , that they might receive through faith the promise of the Spirit .
48003015	Brethren , I am speaking humanly , a ratified covenant , although but a man's , no one can set aside or add to .
48003016	But the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring . It does not say , " and to offsprings , " as meaning many , but as if meaning one , " and to your offspring , " who is Christ .
48003017	I mean this , a covenant ratified by God , the Law that came four hundred and thirty years afterward does not annul , so as to defeat the promise .
48003018	For if the inheritance is by law , it is no longer by promise . But God granted it to Abraham by promise .
48003019	Why then was the Law ? It was added later to make transgressions , until the Offspring should come to whom the promise had been made , and it was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator .
48003020	A mediator does not belong to one person , but God is one .
48003021	Is the Law then against the promises of God ? Never ! For if a law had been given which could give life , then really righteousness would have come by law .
48003022	But the Scripture has shut up all under sin that the promise based on faith in Jesus Christ may be given to those who have faith .
48003023	Before faith came we were guarded under law , shut up waiting for the faith that was to be revealed .
48003024	Thus the Law became our tutor leading us to Christ , that we might be declared righteous by faith .
48003025	Now that faith has come , we are no longer under a tutor .
48003026	You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus .
48003027	All who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
48003028	There cannot be Jew or Greek , slave or free , male or female : for you all are one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	If you are Christ's , then you are Abraham's offspring and heirs according to the promise .
48004001	I SAY that as long as the heir is under age he differs in nothing from a slave , though he be owner of all .
48004002	But he is under guardians and managers until the day appointed by the father .
48004003	So we , when we were under age , were enslaved under the elementary lessons of the world ;
48004004	but , when the fullness of time came , God sent forth his Son born of a woman , born under the Law ,
48004005	that he might redeem those who were under Law , that we might receive the recognition as sons .
48004006	Because you are sons , God has sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son crying Abba , Father .
48004007	So you are no longer a slave , but a son , and if a son , then also an heir , through God's act .
48004008	At the time when you did not know God you were enslaved to what by nature are not gods .
48004009	But now that you know God , or rather have been known by God , how are you turning back to the weak and beggarly elementary lessons to which you wish to be slaves again ?
48004010	You observe days and months and seasons and years .
48004011	You make me afraid that I have labored over you uselessly .
48004012	Become like me , brethren , I beg of you , for I became like you . You have not wronged me in anything .
48004013	You know that because of weakness of the flesh I told you the good news at first .
48004014	And you did not despise or spurn what was a trial to you in my bodily condition , but welcomed me as you would an angel of God , as you would Christ Jesus .
48004015	Where now is the blessing you pronounced on me ? For I bear you witness that if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me .
48004016	Have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth ?
48004017	They are paying court to you , but not honorably . No , they wish to shut you out , so that you may pay court to them .
48004018	It is honorable to be courted in an honorable matter always , and not only when I am with you ,
48004019	my children , for whom I again am suffering birth pangs until Christ is formed in you .
48004020	Would that I could be present with you now and could change my tone , for I am at a loss about you .
48004021	Tell me , you who wish to be under law , do you not hear the Law ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one born of the slave girl and one born of the free wife .
48004023	But he who was born of the slave girl was born according to the flesh , while he who was born of the free wife was born by promise .
48004024	This is an allegory . For these women are the two covenants , one from Mount Sinai , bearing children for slavery . This is Hagar .
48004025	Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia . She represents the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery along with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem on high is free and she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written , " Rejoice , O barren one , you who do not bear ! Break forth and shout , you who feel no birth pangs ! For many are the children of the desolate — more than those of her who has a husband . "
48004028	But you , brethren , are , as Isaac was , children of promise .
48004029	But just as then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit , so it is now .
48004030	But what says the Scripture ? " Cast out the slave girl and her son . For the son of the slave girl shall not inherit along with the son of the free wife . "
48004031	Therefore , brethren , we are not children of a slave girl , but of the free wife .
48005001	STAND firm , therefore , in the freedom with which Christ set us free , and do not wear any yoke of slavery .
48005002	See , I , Paul , tell you that if you receive circumcision , Christ will be of no use to you .
48005003	I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to carry out the whole Law .
48005004	You have put an end to Christ's work for you , you who are declared righteous by law ; you have fallen away from grace .
48005005	For we in the Spirit because of faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness .
48005006	For in Christ Jesus neither has circumcision any value nor uncircumcision , but faith working through love .
48005007	You were running finely . Who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	The persuasion was not from him who called you .
48005009	A little yeast sets the whole lump fermenting .
48005010	I am persuaded in regard to you in the Lord that you will have no other mind . He who is troubling you must bear his condemnation , whoever he may be .
48005011	But I , brethren , if I am still proclaiming circumcision , why am I persecuted ? Then the offensiveness of the cross has been done away .
48005012	Would that those who are troubling you would even cut off all !
48005013	For you were called to freedom , brethren ; only do not let your freedom be an opportunity for the flesh , but in love be servants to one another .
48005014	For the whole Law is summed up in one word : " You shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
48005015	But if you bite and devour one another , take care that you are not destroyed by one another .
48005016	I say , walk in the Spirit and you will not carry out the passions of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh has passions contrary to the Spirit and the Spirit contrary to the flesh , for these are opposed to each other , so that you may not do whatever you wish .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under law .
48005019	The works of the flesh are obvious , such as unchastity , impurity , indecency ,
48005020	idolatry , magic , hatred , strife , jealousy , anger , rivalries , dissensions , factions ,
48005021	envyings , drinking bouts , revelries , and the like . Of these I tell you beforehand , as I have already told you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , slowness to anger , kindness , benevolence , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , self-control ; against such there is no law .
48005024	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its emotions and passions .
48005025	If we are living in the Spirit let us direct our lives by the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not be vainglorious , irritating one another , envying one another .
48006001	BRETHREN , if a man is surprised in some sin , you who are spiritual are to restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness , each looking out for himself to avoid being tempted .
48006002	Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	If any one thinks that he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
48006004	Let each one test his own work and then he will have his reason for boasting in himself alone and not in another .
48006005	For each must bear his own load .
48006006	Let him who is taught the message share with his teacher in all good things .
48006007	Do not be deceived ; God is not mocked ; what a man sows that he will also reap .
48006008	For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap decay ; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap life eternal .
48006009	Let us not grow discouraged in doing what is noble , for in due time we shall reap if we do not grow faint .
48006010	So then as we have opportunity let us work for the good of all men , and especially of those who belong to the household of the faith .
48006011	See with what great letters I write with my own hand .
48006012	All who wish to make a fair show in the flesh are trying to compel you to receive circumcision , but only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48006013	For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law , but they wish you to be circumcised in order to boast in your flesh .
48006014	But let me never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by which the world is crucified to me and I to the world .
48006015	For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
48006016	All who walk by this rule — may peace and mercy be on them , and on the Israel of God !
48006017	For the future let no one trouble me ; for I bear on my body the brands of Jesus .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits , brethren . Amen .
49001001	PAUL , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , to the Holy who are at Ephesus , faithful in Christ Jesus :
49001002	Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
49001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly heights in Christ ,
49001004	even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and spotless before him in love .
49001005	He predestined us to recognition as sons to himself through Jesus Christ according to the kindness of his will ,
49001006	to the praise of his glorious grace which he bestowed on us in the Beloved ,
49001007	in whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our sins , according to the wealth of his loving kindness
49001008	which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding .
49001009	He has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his grace which he purposed in him
49001010	for the government of the fullness of the ages , to bring to unity all things in Christ , both things in the heavens and things on the earth .
49001011	In him we were predestined according to the plan of him who works in all things according to the purpose of his will ,
49001012	and we were made God's heritage in order that we might bring praise to his glory — we who first have fixed our hope on Christ .
49001013	In him you also , after hearing the message of the truth , the good news of your salvation , and putting your faith in him , were sealed by the promised Holy Spirit ,
49001014	which is the pledge of our inheritance in anticipation of the full redemption of God's own people to the praise of his glory .
49001015	For this reason I also , since hearing of your faith in Jesus and your love to all the saints ,
49001016	never cease giving thanks for you when I mention you in my prayers ,
49001017	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father most glorious , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of himself ,
49001018	enlightening the eyes of your heart , that you may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the glorious wealth of his inheritance in the holy ,
49001019	and what the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the inworking of his vast might ,
49001020	which he put forth in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his own right hand in the heavenly heights ,
49001021	far above every archangel and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come .
49001022	He put all things under his feet and placed him as head over all for the church ,
49001023	which is his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all .
49002001	YOU also God raised to life when you were dead in misdeeds and sins
49002002	in which you once walked , following the ways of this age of the world , led by the Ruler of the power of the air , the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience .
49002003	Among these we all lived once in the passions of our flesh and of our thoughts , and we were by nature children of wrath like the rest .
49002004	But God , who is rich in mercy , because of his great love with which he loved us ,
49002005	even when we were dead in misdeeds , made us alive along with Christ — by grace we have been saved —
49002006	and raised us up with him and made us sit with him in the heavenly heights in Christ Jesus ,
49002007	that he might show in the ages to come the surpassing richness of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
49002009	not of works , that no one may boast .
49002010	For we are his work , formed in Christ Jesus for good works in which God had prepared beforehand to have us live .
49002011	Therefore remember that once you were Gentiles in the flesh and were called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in the flesh , made by hands ,
49002012	and that you were then apart from Christ , aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise , without hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far have become near by the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he is our peace . He has made both Jew and Gentile one and has broken down the dividing wall , the enmity .
49002015	In his own flesh he has ended the force of the law of commandments in ordinances in order to make the two , in himself , into one new man , thus making peace ,
49002016	and in order to reconcile both in one body to God through his cross , by slaying the enmity by it .
49002017	And he came and brought the good news of peace to you who were far and peace to those who were near .
49002018	For through him we , both Jews and Gentiles , have access through one Spirit to the Father .
49002019	So then you are no longer strangers and resident aliens , but fellow citizens with the holy and members of the household of God ,
49002020	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone .
49002021	In him all the building , framed together , is growing into a holy temple in the Lord ,
49002022	in whom you also are being built for a dwelling of God in the Spirit .
49003001	FOR this reason I , Paul , the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles , —
49003002	if you have heard of the gracious commission which God has given me to you ,
49003003	that by revelation the mystery has been disclosed to me , as I wrote before briefly ,
49003004	In reading that letter you can learn my understanding in the mystery of Christ ,
49003005	a mystery which was not disclosed in other generations to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ,
49003006	namely , that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body , fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news ,
49003007	of which I became a servant according to the free grace of God which was given me by the inworking of his power .
49003008	To me , the least of all the holy , has this grace been given , to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the unsearchable riches of Christ
49003009	and to show what is the working of the mystery which has been hidden for ages in God , who created all things
49003010	in order to disclose now to the archangels and powers in the heavenly heights , through the church , the varied wisdom of God ,
49003011	according to the eternal purpose which he has accomplished by Christ Jesus our Lord ,
49003012	in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in him .
49003013	So I beg you not to lose heart because of the distresses that come on me for your sake . They are a high honor to you .
49003014	For this reason I bow my knees to the Father
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named ,
49003016	that he may grant to you according to his glorious wealth to be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man ,
49003017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith , and that you , rooted and founded in love ,
49003018	may be able with all the holy to comprehend what is the breadth and length and height and depth —
49003019	yes , to know the love of Christ , which yet surpasses knowledge , and may be filled with all the fullness of God .
49003020	To him who is able to do far beyond all we ask or think by the power that works in us ,
49003021	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus through all the generations of the ages ! Amen .
49004001	I , THE prisoner of the Lord , beg you , then , to live worthily of the calling with which you have been called ,
49004002	with all modesty and gentleness , being slow to anger , bearing with one another in love ,
49004003	earnest in keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were called with one hope that belongs to your calling ,
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
49004007	To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
49004008	Therefore it says , " He ascended on high ; he led away captives ; he gave gifts to men . "
49004009	What does " he ascended " mean , except that he had descended into the lowest parts of the earth ?
49004010	He who descended is also he who " ascended " high above all the heavens to fill all things .
49004011	And he " gave " to some to be apostles , some prophets , some tellers of the good news , some shepherds and teachers ,
49004012	for the equipment of the saints , for the work of service , for building up the body of Christ ,
49004013	until we all attain oneness in the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God , and the maturity of manhood and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ .
49004014	Then we shall be no longer children tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching through the trickery of men and craftiness in the devices of deceit ,
49004015	but speaking the truth in love we shall grow wholly into him who is the head , Christ ,
49004016	from whom the whole body framed together and strengthened by what every joint supplies vigorously , in the measure of each , makes growth in building itself up in love .
49004017	This then I say and solemnly protest in the Lord : that you are no longer to live as the Gentiles live in vacancy of mind ,
49004018	having their understanding darkened , aliens from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them , and because of the hardness of their hearts .
49004019	Lost to any sense of shame they have abandoned themselves to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness .
49004020	But you have not so learned Christ ,
49004021	if you have heard him and have been taught in him as the truth is in Jesus ,
49004022	that you should put away the old man who belonged to your former way of life and was perishing in deluding passions ,
49004023	and that you should be made new in the spirit of your minds
49004024	and put on the new man formed as God approves in the righteousness and holiness of truth .
49004025	Therefore put aside lying and speak truth every one to his neighbor , for we are members one of another .
49004026	" Be angry and do not sin . " Do not let the sun go down on your wrath ,
49004027	neither give place for the Devil .
49004028	He who steals must steal no longer , but rather he must labor , working with his own hands something good , so as to have something to share with any one in need .
49004029	Let no vile word come out of your mouth , but , if anything , a good word for needed upbuilding of character to give grace to those who hear .
49004030	Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and abusive language be put away from you with every kind of malice .
49004032	Be kind to one another , sympathetic , forgiving one another just as God in Christ has forgiven you .
49005001	BE imitators of God as beloved children
49005002	and live in love , as Christ loved us and gave himself for us , an offering and sacrifice to God yielding a fragrant odor .
49005003	Unchastity or any kind of impurity or greediness must not be mentioned among you , as befits holy people ;
49005004	nor should there be indecent and foolish talk or jesting , which are unbecoming , but rather thanksgiving .
49005005	For you know well that no unchaste or impure person , no greedy person — who is an idolater — has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
49005006	Let no one deceive you with empty words ; for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience .
49005007	Do not , then , be partakers with them .
49005008	For you were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Live like children of light —
49005009	for the fruit of light appears in all generosity and righteousness and truth —
49005010	testing what is pleasing to the Lord ,
49005011	and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them ,
49005012	for the things that they do in secret it is shameful even to speak of .
49005013	But all things when reproved are shown truly by the light , for everything shown truly is light .
49005014	Therefore it says , " Wake , O sleeper , and rise from the dead and Christ will give you light . "
49005015	Be strictly careful , then , how you live , not as unwise but as wise .
49005016	Buy up the opportunity , because these are evil days .
49005017	Therefore do not be thoughtless , but understand what is the Lord's will .
49005018	Do not be drunk with wine , in which there is profligacy , but be full of the Spirit ,
49005019	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and playing the harp heartily to the Lord ,
49005020	giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father .
49005021	Be subject to one another in reverence for Christ ,
49005022	wives to their own husbands as in the Lord ,
49005023	because a man is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body .
49005024	But as the church is subject to Christ , so wives are to their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it ,
49005026	that he might make it holy , cleansing it by the washing with water according to his word ,
49005027	that he might present to himself the church glorious , without spot or wrinkle or any such thing , but holy and faultless .
49005028	Thus ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies . He who loves his own wife loves himself ,
49005029	for no one ever hates his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as Christ does the church ,
49005030	for we are members of his body .
49005031	" Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh .
49005032	" This mystery is great , but I am speaking of Christ and the church .
49005033	But each one of you must love his own wife as himself , and the wife must reverence her husband .
49006001	CHILDREN , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right .
49006002	" Honor your father and your mother . " This is the first commandment with a promise ,
49006003	" That it may go well with you and you may be long-lived in the land . "
49006004	And you , fathers , do not irritate your children , but bring them up in the education and admonition of the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , obey those who according to the flesh are your masters , with reverence and awe in singleness of your hearts as to Christ ,
49006006	not with eye service as pleasers of men , but as Christ's slaves , doing the will of God in a whole-souled way ,
49006007	giving service with cheerfulness as to the Lord and not to men ,
49006008	knowing that whatever good thing each one does that he will be rewarded for by the Lord , whether he be slave or free .
49006009	And you , masters , do the same by them , avoiding threats , knowing that the Master both of them and of you is in the heavens , and there is no partiality for rank with him .
49006010	To conclude : Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might .
49006011	Put on the complete armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the cunning arts of the Devil .
49006012	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood , but against the arch-angels , against the authorities , against the world-rulers of this darkness , against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly heights .
49006013	Therefore take the complete armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and , after going through everything , to stand .
49006014	Stand , then , belted with truth , wearing the breastplate of righteousness ,
49006015	shod with the readiness of the good news of peace .
49006016	In every event take up the shield of faith by which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Evil One ,
49006017	and accept the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
49006018	Pray at all times in the Spirit with all manner of prayer and entreaty ; be awake to this with all intentness and with prayer for all the holy
49006019	and in my behalf , that words may be given to me when I open my month to make known with fearlessness the mystery of the good news ,
49006020	for which I am an ambassador in chains , that I may tell it fearlessly as I ought .
49006021	That you also may know my situation , what I am doing , Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord ,
49006022	whom I am sending to you for this very purpose , will tell you everything , so that you may know the news of me and he may encourage your hearts .
49006023	Peace to the brethren and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
49006024	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying love !
50001001	PAUL and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus , to all the Holy in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , with Bishops and Deacons :
50001002	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	I thank my God for all your remembrance of me ,
50001004	always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy
50001005	for your fellowship in spreading the good news from the first day until now ,
50001006	being confident of this very thing , that he who has begun the good work in you will carry it on to completion on the day of Christ Jesus .
50001007	So it is right for me to think of you all , because you have me in your hearts , and in my chains and in my defense and in establishing the good news you are all sharers in my privilege .
50001008	For God is my witness how much I long for you all in the affections of Christ Jesus .
50001009	And this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all insight ,
50001010	so that you may discriminate between the things that differ , that you may be pure and blameless in the day of Christ ,
50001011	filled with the fruit of knowledge through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	I wish you to know , brethren , that my affairs have turned out rather to the furtherance of the good news ,
50001013	so that my chains have become well known as for Christ to the whole Praetorian Guard and to all the rest ,
50001014	and the most of the brethren in the Lord , made confident by my chains , are unusually brave in speaking the message fearlessly .
50001015	Some indeed proclaim Christ because of envy and rivalry , some also because of good will .
50001016	Some announce Christ from love , knowing that I am placed for the defense of the good news ,
50001017	but others out of partisanship , thinking to add distress to my chains .
50001018	What then ? Still in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed and in that I rejoice , yes , and will rejoice .
50001019	For I know that this will make for my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
50001020	according to my earnest expectation and hope that I may be put to shame in nothing , but with all courage , as always , so now Christ may be honored in my body , whether by my life or by my death .
50001021	For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain .
50001022	If it is to be life in the flesh , that means fruitful work for me . I know not which to choose .
50001023	I am under pressure both ways , having the desire to depart and be with Christ , for it is far better ,
50001024	yet that I should stay in the flesh is more needful on your account .
50001025	And this I confidently know , that I shall stay and stay near you all for your advancement and joy of faith ,
50001026	that your exultation in Christ Jesus may overflow on my account , because of my presence again with you .
50001027	Only exercise your citizenship in a manner worthy of the good news of Christ , so that , whether I come and see you or in absence hear news of you , I may know that you are standing in one spirit , with one mind wrestling in the faith of the good news
50001028	and not frightened in anything by your adversaries , which for them is a sign of ruin , but for you of salvation , and that from God ;
50001029	because it has been graciously allowed you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for his sake ,
50001030	and you have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear of in me .
50002001	IF there is any encouragement in Christ , any persuasive power in love , any fellowship in the Spirit , any sympathies and compassions ,
50002002	fill up my joy by having the same love , being of the same mind , thinking the same thing ,
50002003	doing nothing in a partisan or vainglorious way , but each modestly regarding the others as of more account than himself .
50002004	Do not be each intent on his own interests , but also on the interests of others .
50002005	Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus ,
50002006	who , though he was in the form of God , did not think that equality with God was something to be grasped ,
50002007	but emptied himself , taking the form of a servant and coming into the likeness of men ,
50002008	and when found in the condition of a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient even to death — death on the cross .
50002009	Therefore , God has highly exalted him and has graciously given him the name which is above every name ,
50002010	that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow , of beings in heaven and those on earth and those under the earth ,
50002011	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	So then , my beloved , as you have always obeyed , not in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with reverence and awe .
50002013	For it is God who is working in you both the willing and the doing because of his kindness .
50002014	Do everything without murmurings or disputings
50002015	that you may be blameless and pure , children of God , spotless in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you shine as lights in the world ,
50002016	holding forth the message of life , so that on the day of Christ I can boast that I did not run in vain or labor in vain .
50002017	But if I am poured out as a libation on your sacrificial offering of faith , I rejoice and share the joy of you all .
50002018	In the same way you must rejoice and share my joy .
50002019	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I may be cheered by knowing about you .
50002020	For I have no one likeminded with him who will so sincerely care for your interests .
50002021	For all pursue their own aims , not those of Christ Jesus .
50002022	But you know how he has been tested and how like a child with a father he has served with me in spreading the good news .
50002023	So I hope to send him at once when I see how my affairs are going .
50002024	And I trust in the Lord that I myself shall come quickly .
50002025	I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier , and your messenger and minister to my needs ,
50002026	since he longs for you all and is troubled because you have heard that he was sick .
50002027	Indeed he was sick and near to death . But God had mercy on him , and not on him alone , but also on me , that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow .
50002028	I send him the more readily that you may see him and rejoice again and I be less sorrowful .
50002029	Receive him in the Lord with all joy and hold such men in honor ,
50002030	because for the work of Christ he was near to death , hazarding his life to complete the service you were not here to do for me .
50003001	TO conclude , my brethren : rejoice in the Lord . To repeat to you the same things is not tiresome to me and it is safe for you .
50003002	Beware of the dogs , beware of the bad workmen , beware of the excision .
50003003	For we are the circumcision , we who worship in the Spirit of God and exult in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh ,
50003004	though I have ground for confidence even in the flesh . If any other man thinks that he has ground for confidence in the flesh , I have more —
50003005	circumcised the eighth day , of the race of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews , as to the Law a Pharisee ,
50003006	as to zeal persecuting the church , as to the righteousness of the Law blameless .
50003007	But the things that were gain to me , those I have counted loss for Christ .
50003008	Yes , I count all to be loss because of the surpassing worth of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord , for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but refuse , that I may gain Christ
50003009	and be found in him , not having my own righteousness that was from the Law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which comes from God and rests on faith ,
50003010	that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming like him in death ,
50003011	if possibly I may attain to the resurrection from the dead .
50003012	Not that I have already obtained it or have already been made perfect , but I press on to lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus .
50003013	Brethren , I do not consider myself yet to have laid hold of it . But one thing I do : forgetting what is behind and stretching forward to what is in front
50003014	I press toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Let us all who are full grown think in this way . If in anything you think differently , even that God will reveal to you ,
50003016	but so far as we have attained let us walk in the same path .
50003017	Unite in imitating me , brethren , and watch those who are living according to our example .
50003018	For many are living as I used often to tell you and now say even weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	Their end is ruin , their God is their stomach , their glory is in their shame , they think earthly thoughts .
50003020	For the state of which we are citizens is in the heavens and from there we are expecting a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ .
50003021	He will transform the body we have in our low estate into the likeness of the body he has in glory by the power by which he can subject all things to himself .
50004001	SO , my brethren beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , stand firm thus in the Lord , beloved .
50004002	I beg Euodia and I beg Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , I ask you , true yokefellow , help them , since they struggled in spreading the good news along with me and Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always . Again I say rejoice .
50004005	Let your fairness be known to all men . The Lord is near .
50004006	Do not worry , but in everything by prayer and entreaty with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God .
50004007	And the peace of God which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus .
50004008	To conclude , brethren , whatever is true , whatever is dignified , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is lovable , whatever is highly spoken of — if there is any virtue or any praise — think of that .
50004009	What you learned and accepted and heard and saw in me — practice that . And the God of peace will be with you .
50004010	I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length your thoughtfulness for me had revived . You were thoughtful for me all along , but lacked opportunity .
50004011	Not that I am speaking because of want ; for I have learned how to be content in whatever circumstances I am .
50004012	I know how to live humbly and I know how to enjoy abundance . In each and every situation I have been initiated into the secret both of being well fed and of going hungry , both of having abundance and of bearing want .
50004013	I can do all things through him who gives me strength .
50004014	Yet you did nobly in sharing with me in my distress .
50004015	You Philippians know that at the beginning of the good news , when I came away from Macedonia , no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only ,
50004016	and that in Thessalonica you sent once , yes , twice , for my need .
50004017	Not that I am seeking for the gift , but I am seeking for the fruit that increases to your credit .
50004018	I have enough of everything and more than enough . I am fully supplied since receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you , a fragrant odor , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
50004019	My God will supply every need of yours according to his wealth in glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	To God our Father be glory for the ages of the ages ! Amen .
50004021	Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus . The brethren with me send greetings to you .
50004022	All the holy send greetings to you , especially those of Caesar's household .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits !
51001001	PAUL , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ in Colossae : Grace be to you and peace from God our Father !
51001003	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , in praying for you ,
51001004	because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have to all the holy
51001005	because of the hope laid up for us in heaven . Of this you have already heard in the true message of the good news
51001006	which has come to you . Just as in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing , so also it is among you since the day that you heard and learned of the grace of God in truth .
51001007	So you learned it from Epaphras , our beloved fellow servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ in your behalf ,
51001008	and who has told us of your love in the Spirit .
51001009	For this reason we also , from the day we heard it , never cease praying for you and asking that you may have full knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual insight ,
51001010	and that you may live lives worthy of the Lord and please him in every way . May you bear fruit in every good work and grow in the knowledge of God .
51001011	May you be strengthened with all strength according to his glorious power , so as to have all patience and endurance .
51001012	May you joyfully give thanks to the Father who has made you fit to share in the inheritance of the holy in light .
51001013	He has saved us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of our sins .
51001015	He is the image of the invisible God , the first born of all creation ;
51001016	for in him were created all things in heaven and on earth , both visible and invisible , whether thrones or lordships or archangels or powers — all things have been created through him and for him ,
51001017	and he is before all things and in him all things unite .
51001018	And he is the head of the body , the church . He is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , that he may be first in all things ,
51001019	because it pleased God to have all his fullness dwell in him
51001020	and to reconcile all things to himself through him , making peace through the blood of his cross — all things , I say , whether on earth or in heaven .
51001021	And you who were once alienated and enemies in your minds , living in wicked works , he has reconciled
51001022	by his body of flesh through death , to present you holy and spotless and blameless before him ,
51001023	if you remain in the faith , firm and steadfast , never moving from the hope of the good news which you have heard and which has been proclaimed in all the creation under heaven , and of which I , Paul , became a servant .
51001024	Now I rejoice in what I suffer for your sake , and in my turn am filling up in my flesh what was lacking in the afflictions of Christ for the sake of his body , that is , the church .
51001025	I became a servant of the church according to the commission from God given to me for you , to deliver fully God's message ,
51001026	the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now made plain to his holy ones ,
51001027	to whom God willed to make known what is the glorious wealth of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you the hope of glory .
51001028	And we are announcing him , warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom in order that we may present every man complete in Christ .
51001029	For this also I labor , wrestling with the energy of him who works powerfully within me .
51002001	FOR I wish you to know how I am wrestling for you and for those in Laodicea and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh ,
51002002	that your hearts may be encouraged and that joined together in love you may reach all the wealth of the full assurance of insight into the knowledge of the mystery of God , which is Christ .
51002003	In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden .
51002004	I say this that no one may deceive you by plausible arguments .
51002005	For even though I am absent in the flesh , yet in the spirit I am with you , rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ .
51002006	Since , then , you have received Christ Jesus as Lord , live in him ,
51002007	rooted and built up in him , growing strong in the faith as you have been taught , and overflowing with thanksgiving .
51002008	Beware that no one carries you away captive by his philosophy and empty deceit according to the tradition of men , according to the elementary teachings of the world and not according to Christ .
51002009	For in him dwells all the fullness of God in bodily form ,
51002010	and you have been filled in him . He is the head of every archangel and authority .
51002011	In him you were circumcised with a circumcision not done by hands , by laying aside your fleshly body in the circumcision of Christ .
51002012	You were buried with him in baptism and raised again through faith in the inworking of God who raised him from the dead .
51002013	You who were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh God has made alive with him , and has forgiven us all our sins .
51002014	He erased the writing that was against us in the rules , the writing that was opposed to us . He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to his cross .
51002015	He despoiled the archangels and authorities and fearlessly made an example of them when he triumphed over them on the cross .
51002016	Let no one then judge you in the matter of food or drink or in regard to a festival or new moon or Sabbath .
51002017	These were a shadow of coming things , but the body is Christ's .
51002018	Let no one as umpire defraud you of your prize , if he delights in excessive humility and ceremonial worship of the angels , searching into his own visions , emptily puffed up by his fleshly mind
51002019	and not holding to the Head , from whom the whole body , supplied and held together by joints and bands , grows as God gives it growth .
51002020	If you died with Christ to the elementary teachings of the world , why do you , as if still living in the world , have such rules as ,
51002021	" Do not touch , " " Do not taste , " " Do not handle "
51002022	referring to things that perish when used ?
51002023	These rules follow the commandments and teachings of men . They have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed ceremonial and excessive humility and severity to the body , but have no value against the indulgence of the flesh .
51003001	IF then you have been raised with Christ , seek the things above , where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God .
51003002	Have your minds on the things above and not on the things on the earth .
51003003	For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , our life , appears , then you also will appear with him in glory .
51003005	Treat the members of your earthly bodies as dead — dead to unchastity , impurity , passion , evil desire , and avarice , which is idolatry .
51003006	On account of these things comes the wrath of God .
51003007	To them you also were once habituated when you lived in them .
51003008	But now you also must put away all wrath , anger , malice , abusive language . Vile talk must not be in your mouths .
51003009	Do not lie to one another . You have stripped off the old self with his practices
51003010	and have clothed yourselves with the new self , which is being renewed into knowledge in the image of its Creator .
51003011	Here there is no Greek or Jew , circumcision or uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , slave or freeman , but Christ is all and in all .
51003012	Put on , then , as the chosen of God , holy and beloved , sympathies , compassions , kindness , humility , gentleness , slowness to anger ,
51003013	bearing with one another and forgiving one another , if any one has a grievance against any . Just as the Lord forgave you , so must you forgive .
51003014	Above all these , clothe yourselves with love , which is the perfect bond of union .
51003015	Let the peace of Christ be umpire in your hearts . For this you were called into one body . And be thankful .
51003016	The message of Christ must dwell in you richly , as you teach in all wisdom and admonish one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and sing with grace in your hearts to God .
51003017	And whatever you do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not be harsh toward them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this is pleasing in the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not irritate your children , for they may lose heart .
51003022	Slaves , obey in everything your masters in the flesh , not with eye-service as men-pleasers , but in sincerity of heart , because you reverence the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , do it heartily as for the Lord and not for men ,
51003024	for you know that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance . You are slaves to the Lord Christ .
51003025	He who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done , and there is no partiality .
51004001	MASTERS , give to your slaves what is just and equal , for you know that you have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Be earnest and constant in prayer . Be thankfully watchful in it .
51004003	Pray along with us and for us that God may open for us a door for the message , so that I may tell the mystery of Christ for the sake of which I am in chains —
51004004	so that I may make it clear , as I ought .
51004005	Behave wisely towards outsiders , buying up the opportunity .
51004006	Let what you say be always with grace , seasoned with salt . Know how you should answer each one .
51004007	Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful worker and fellow servant in the Lord , will tell you everything about me .
51004008	I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that you may know my situation and that he may encourage your hearts .
51004009	And with him I am sending Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They will tell you all about affairs here .
51004010	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , sends his greetings , and so does Mark , the cousin of Barnabas ,
51004011	and so does Jesus who is called Justus . These alone of those who are circumcised are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God , and they have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , the servant of Christ Jesus , who is one of you , sends his greetings to you . He always wrestles in prayer on your behalf that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God .
51004013	I bear witness to the burden that he carries for you and for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas send you their greetings .
51004015	Give our greeting to the brethren in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house .
51004016	When this letter has been read among you , have it read in the church of the Laodiceans , and you are to read the letter that will come from Laodicea .
51004017	Say to Archippus , See to it that you fully perform the service which you have accepted in the Lord .
51004018	The greeting of Paul , by my own hand . Remember my chains . Grace be with you .
52001001	PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy , to the Church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace .
52001002	We thank God always for you all when we mention you in our prayers ,
52001003	unceasingly remembering your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before God our Father .
52001004	We know , brethren beloved by God , that he has chosen you
52001005	and that our good news came to you not in word only but in power and in the Holy Spirit and in great assurance , just as you know we acted among you for your benefit .
52001006	You became imitators of us and of the Lord , receiving the message in great affliction with joy which the Holy Spirit gave ,
52001007	so that you became a pattern for all believers in Macedonia and in Achaia .
52001008	For the message of the Lord sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but in every place your faith toward God has gone abroad , so that there is no need for us to speak a word .
52001009	For the people themselves are telling about us , what a reception we had with you , and how you turned to God from idols , to serve the living and true God
52001010	and to wait for his Son from heaven — his Son Jesus whom he raised from the dead and who is saving us from the coming wrath .
52002001	YOU yourselves know , brethren , what a reception we had from you , that it was not without result ,
52002002	but after we had suffered and been roughly treated , as you know , in Philippi , we made bold in our God to speak to you the good news of God with great wrestling .
52002003	For our appeal springs not from deception , nor from impure motives , nor from cunning ,
52002004	but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news , so we speak , not as if we were pleasing men , but God , who tests our hearts .
52002005	Nor did we ever fall into flattering talk , as you know , nor use any pretext for self-enrichment — God is witness —
52002006	nor did we seek glory from men , either from you or others , although we could have claimed the dignity of Christ's apostles .
52002007	But we became gentle in the midst of you like a nursing mother cherishing her own children .
52002008	Yearning over you so , we would gladly have imparted to you not only God's good news but our own lives as well , because you had become dear to us .
52002009	For you remember , brethren , our toil and labor as we worked night and day so as not to burden any one of you while we proclaimed to you the good news of God .
52002010	You are witnesses — and God is witness — how purely and justly and blamelessly we acted toward you who believe .
52002011	You know that just like a father toward his own children we encouraged each one of you , and warned and conjured you
52002012	to live lives worthy of the God who is calling you into his own kingdom and glory .
52002013	For this reason we unceasingly give thanks to God that when you received from us the report of the message of God you accepted it not as the message of men , but , as it truly is , the message of God , which also is doing its work in you who believe .
52002014	For you became imitators , brethren , of the churches of God that are in Judaea in Christ Jesus , because you too suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen that they did from the Jews ,
52002015	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove us out and do not please God and are enemies to all men ,
52002016	trying to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved . All this goes always to fill up the measure of their sins . But God's fiercest wrath has overtaken them .
52002017	But we , brethren , when bereft of you for a little while , out of sight not out of mind , endeavored more earnestly to see your faces , with great longing .
52002018	For that reason we determined to come to you , yes , I , Paul , more than once : but Satan hindered us .
52002019	For what is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming ? Is it not you ?
52002020	You are our glory and joy .
52003001	SO when we could no longer endure the anxiety , we chose to be left at Athens alone
52003002	and sent Timothy , our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you in your faith ,
52003003	that no one might be disturbed in these trials . For you yourselves know that we are destined to this .
52003004	For when we were with you we told you in advance , " We shall soon have trouble . " And so it came to pass , as you know .
52003005	Therefore , when I could no longer endure the anxiety , I sent to know about your faith for fear that the tempter had tempted you and our labor had gone for nothing .
52003006	But now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love , and that you always keep us well in mind and long to see us , just as we long to see you ,
52003007	we have been cheered , brethren , in regard to you , in all our straits and distresses by your faith .
52003008	Now we are living , since you are standing firm in the Lord .
52003009	For how can we be grateful enough to God for you in view of all the joy we have because of you ,
52003010	while we pray beyond measure night and day that we may see your faces and make good whatever lacks there may be in your faith ?
52003011	May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ open the way for us to come to you .
52003012	The Lord make you to abound and overflow in love toward one another and toward all men , just as we do toward you ,
52003013	that your hearts may be made firm and you may be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones .
52004001	TO conclude , brethren , we beg of you and urge you in the Lord Jesus that , as you learned from us how you ought to live to please God , and are living , you will excel still more .
52004002	For you know what directions we have given you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is the will of God : to have you become holy and have you shun unchastity ;
52004004	to have each of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness and honor ,
52004005	not in the passion of lust , as the Gentiles do who know not God ;
52004006	to have no one trespass or take advantage of his brother in this matter ; for the Lord is the punisher of all such , as we have already told you and solemnly warned you .
52004007	God has not called us to live in impurity , but in holiness .
52004008	Therefore he who disregards this disregards not man , but God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you .
52004009	Regarding brotherly love you have no need for me to write to you . For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another ,
52004010	and you do the same to all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia . But we urge you , brethren , to excel still further
52004011	and to be ambitious to lead a quiet life and to mind each his own business and to work with your hands , as we instructed you .
52004012	Thus you will live becomingly in the sight of outsiders and will have need of nothing .
52004013	We do not wish you to be ignorant , brethren , regarding those who are sleeping , that you may not sorrow as the rest of men who have no hope .
52004014	For since , as we believe , Jesus died and rose , so too God will through Jesus bring with him those who have fallen asleep .
52004015	This we tell you by the word of the Lord : We , the living , who have been left until the coming of the Lord , will not have the start of those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of an archangel and with God's trumpet-call , and first the dead in Christ will rise .
52004017	Then we , the living , who are left , will be caught up along with them into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And thus we shall forever be with the Lord .
52004018	So encourage one another with these words .
52005001	BUT regarding times and dates , brethren , you do not need to have me write to you .
52005002	For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .
52005003	When they are saying , " Peace and safety , " then sudden destruction is upon them , like the pangs upon a woman with child , and they will not escape .
52005004	But you , brethren , are not in darkness so that the day can take you like a thief .
52005005	You are all sons of light and sons of day . We do not belong to night or to darkness .
52005006	Then let us not be sleeping like the rest of men , but let us watch and be sober .
52005007	For those who sleep sleep in the night and those who drink drink in the night .
52005008	But let us who are of the day be sober . Let us put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God has not destined us to wrath , but to the winning of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52005010	who died for us that whether we are waking or sleeping we may live in company with him .
52005011	Therefore encourage one another and build up one another , as indeed you are doing .
52005012	We beg you , brethren , to regard those who are laboring among you and who preside over you in the Lord and give you counsel ,
52005013	and to esteem them very highly in love on account of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	We urge you , brethren , to warn the disorderly , encourage the faint-hearted , help the weak , be patient with all .
52005015	Take care that no one repays evil with evil , but always seek eagerly what is good in dealing with one another and with every one .
52005016	Always be joyful .
52005017	Pray without ceasing .
52005018	In everything give thanks , for this is God's will in Christ for you .
52005019	Do not quench the Spirit .
52005020	Do not despise prophecies .
52005021	Test all things ; hold fast the good .
52005022	Avoid every kind of evil .
52005023	May the God of peace himself make you completely holy , and may your spirits and souls and bodies be kept faultless and blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	He is faithful who calls you and he will do it .
52005025	Brethren , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss .
52005027	I solemnly charge you in the Lord's name to have this letter read to all the brethren .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy to the Church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	We ought always to thank God for you , brethren , as is fitting , since your faith is growing greatly and the love of each and all of you toward one another is increasing ,
53001004	so that we ourselves glory in you among the churches of God because of your endurance and faith in all of your persecutions and in the distresses you are bearing .
53001005	This is a proof of God's righteous judgment . It is to make you worthy of God's kingdom , on behalf of which you are suffering ,
53001006	since it is just on God's part to repay with trouble those who are troubling you ,
53001007	and to repay to you , who are being troubled , rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels .
53001008	With flaming fire he will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction and be sent away from the face of the Lord and from his glorious power ,
53001010	when he comes to be glorified among his holy ones and to be wondered at on that day among all believers — for our testimony to you was believed .
53001011	To this end we are always praying for you that our God will make you worthy of the call , and will by his power bring to completion every one of your kind purposes and works of faith ,
53001012	that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	WITH regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to meet him , I beg you , brethren ,
53002002	not to be quickly unsettled in mind nor excited by either a revelation or by a message or a letter supposed to be from us , to the effect that the day of the Lord is close at hand .
53002003	Let no one lead you astray in any way , because it will not come until the Apostasy has first come and the Man of Lawlessness has been revealed — the Son of Perdition ,
53002004	who opposes and exalts himself above everything called God and every object of worship , so that he enters the Temple of God and seats himself there , declaring that he himself is God .
53002005	Do you not remember that while I was still with you I used to tell you this ?
53002006	And now you know what is restraining him until he is revealed at his appointed time .
53002007	For the mystery of lawlessness is already working , only there is just now one who is restraining it until he passes out of the way .
53002008	And then the Lawless One will be revealed . But the Lord Jesus will sweep him away with the breath of his mouth and will make him powerless by the splendor of his coming .
53002009	For his coming will be when Satan is active in every sort of power and in false signs and wonders
53002010	and in every kind of wicked deception of those who are perishing , because they did not receive the love of the truth so that they might be saved .
53002011	For this reason God sends to them a deceptive influence so that they believe a lie ,
53002012	that all who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness may be condemned .
53002013	We ought always to thank God for you , brethren , beloved by the Lord , because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through the Spirit's making you holy and your own faith in the truth .
53002014	To this he called you through the good news that we brought , so that you may share the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	Now then , brethren , stand firm and hold fast the teachings that you have been taught whether by our words or by our letter .
53002016	May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father , who loved us and gave us eternal encouragement and good hope through grace ,
53002017	encourage your hearts and make you strong in every good word and work .
53003001	IN conclusion , brethren , pray for us , that the Lord's message may run and be glorified , as among you ,
53003002	and that we may be saved from the unreasonable and wicked men , for faith does not belong to all .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful and he will strengthen you and guard you from evil .
53003004	We are persuaded in the Lord in regard to you that you are doing and will do what we direct .
53003005	The Lord guide your hearts in the love of God and the patience of Christ .
53003006	We charge you , brethren , in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , to stand aloof from every brother who is living in a disorderly way and not according to the teaching that you received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know that you should imitate us , for we were not disorderly when among you ,
53003008	nor did we eat bread with any one without paying , but with labor and toil night and day we worked in order not to burden any one of you .
53003009	Not that we have not the authority , but in order to give you ourselves as an example for you to imitate .
53003010	For when we were with you we gave you this command , " If any one will not work , neither is he to eat . "
53003011	For we hear that some among you are leading disorderly lives , busy about nothing and yet busybodies .
53003012	Such we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own bread .
53003013	But you , brethren , must not become discouraged in doing well .
53003014	If any one does not obey our words in this letter , mark that man and do not associate with him , so that he may be ashamed .
53003015	Yet do not regard him as an enemy , but warn him as a brother .
53003016	The Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . The Lord be with you all .
53003017	The greeting of Paul by my own hand , which is the sign in every letter . This is my handwriting .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you .
54001001	PAUL , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God , our Savior , and Christ Jesus our hope ,
54001002	to Timothy my true child in faith : Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	As I begged you to stay in Ephesus when I was leaving for Macedonia , that you might charge some not to teach new and strange doctrines
54001004	nor give attention to myths and endless genealogies , which promote disputes rather than God's plan in the faith , so I beg you now .
54001005	The aim of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .
54001006	Some missing these have turned aside to empty talk ,
54001007	wishing to be teachers of the Law , but not understanding either what they are saying or what the things are that they are so positive about .
54001008	We know that the Law is excellent , if any one uses it lawfully .
54001009	But we know this : that law is not laid down for a righteous man , but for the lawless and the insubordinate , the ungodly and sinners , the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
54001010	for the unchaste , for those who practice unnatural vices , for slave-dealers , liars , perjurers , and for whatever else is contrary to wholesome teaching
54001011	such as accords with the glorious good news of the blessed God , with which I have been entrusted .
54001012	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me strength , because he thought me faithful and put me into his service ,
54001013	though before that I spoke profanely and was a persecutor and insolent in outrages . But I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
54001014	And the grace of our Lord overflowed in me with faith and love in Christ Jesus .
54001015	The saying is trust-worthy and deserving of full acceptance that " Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , " of whom I am the foremost .
54001016	But I received mercy for this reason , that in me , as the foremost , Jesus Christ might show all of his long-suffering for an example for those who are to believe in him and gain life eternal .
54001017	To the King of the ages , the immortal , invisible , only God , be honor and glory for the ages of the ages ! Amen .
54001018	This command I lay down for you , my child Timothy , in accordance with the prophecies that came in advance regarding you , in order that armed with them you may wage the noble war ,
54001019	holding to faith and a good conscience , which some have cast aside and thus made shipwreck of their faith .
54001020	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have handed over to Satan , that they may learn not to speak profanely .
54002001	I BEG , then , first of all , that petitions , prayers , supplications , and thanksgivings be made in behalf of all men ,
54002002	in behalf of kings and all who are in authority , that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and sobriety .
54002003	This is excellent and pleasing in the sight of God , our Savior ,
54002004	who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men , himself man , Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a ransom for all , a fact to be witnessed to at the fitting time .
54002007	To this I was appointed a herald and an apostle — I am telling the truth , I am not lying — a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth .
54002008	I wish , then , that the men offer prayer in every place , lifting up holy hands without wrath or debate .
54002009	Also that the women adorn themselves in becoming dress modestly and discreetly , not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes ,
54002010	but — as is becoming for women professing piety — with good deeds .
54002011	A woman is to learn in all subjection .
54002012	I do not permit a woman to teach or to usurp authority over a man , but she must remain silent .
54002013	Adam was first formed , then Eve .
54002014	And Adam was not deceived ; the woman was deceived and fell into sin .
54002015	But they will be saved through child-bearing , if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control .
54003001	THE saying is trustworthy : " If any one aspires to the office of a bishop , he desires a noble work . "
54003002	A bishop , then , should be above reproach , true to one woman , temperate , self-controlled , dignified , hospitable , with a gift for teaching ,
54003003	not given to wine or to blows , but fair-minded , averse to strife , not a lover of money ,
54003004	presiding well over his own house , with children obedient and respectful .
54003005	But if any one does not know how to preside over his own house , how will he take care of the church of God ?
54003006	He must not be a new convert , for fear he may be blinded by pride and fall into the condemnation of the Devil .
54003007	He must have a good reputation with outsiders so as not to fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil .
54003008	Deacons , in the same way , must be dignified , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not eager for base gain ,
54003009	holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience .
54003010	They must first be tested , and then let them fill the office of deacon if there is nothing against them .
54003011	Women , in the same way , must be dignified , not slanderers , temperate , trustworthy in everything .
54003012	Deacons must be men true to one woman , presiding well over their children and their own houses .
54003013	Those who have filled the office of deacon well win for themselves a high standing and great boldness in the faith in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I am writing these things to you , although I hope to come to you soon ,
54003015	but so that if I am delayed you may know how people should conduct themselves in the household of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and base of the truth .
54003016	Confessedly great is the mystery of godliness : " Who was manifested in flesh , declared righteous in spirit , seen by angels , proclaimed among Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up in glory . "
54004001	THE Spirit says distinctly that in later times some will desert from the faith , giving attention to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons ,
54004002	through the hypocrisy of men who teach falsely , branded in their own consciences ,
54004003	forbidding marriage , and insisting on abstinence from certain kinds of food which God made to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and know the truth .
54004004	For everything made by God is excellent and nothing is to be rejected if taken with thanksgiving .
54004005	For it is made holy through God's message and through prayer .
54004006	In teaching this to the brethren you will be a noble servant of Christ Jesus , nourished by the words of the faith and of the excellent teaching which you have followed .
54004007	But avoid profane and old-womanish myths . Exercise yourself in godliness .
54004008	Bodily exercise is useful to a small degree , but godliness is useful for everything . " It has the promise of the present life and of the life that is to come . "
54004009	This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance .
54004010	For to this end we are laboring and wrestling , because we have set our hope on the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of believers .
54004011	Command and teach these things .
54004012	Let no one look down on you because you are young , but be an example to believers in speech , in the life you lead , in love , in faith , in purity .
54004013	Until I come give attention to reading , to exhortation , to teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect the gift that is in you , which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership .
54004015	Be careful about these things , be fully occupied with them , that your progress may be plain to all .
54004016	Be thoughtful about yourself and your teaching . Persevere in this ; for in doing so you will save yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	Do not rebuke an older man , but entreat him as a father , the younger men as brothers ,
54005002	the older women as mothers and the younger women as sisters , in all purity .
54005003	Honor widows if they are really widows .
54005004	If any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to act piously toward their own family and to repay what they owe to their parents and grandparents . For this is pleasing in the sight of God .
54005005	A real widow who is left alone has set her hope on God and devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day .
54005006	But the pleasure-loving widow , though living , is already dead .
54005007	Give these commands that they may be free from reproach .
54005008	If any one does not provide for his own , and especially those of his own household , he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	A widow is to be put on the list if she has reached the age of not less than sixty years , if she has been true to one husband ,
54005010	has a reputation for good deeds , has brought up children , has entertained strangers , has washed the feet of the holy , has ministered to people in distress , has been active in every good work .
54005011	But younger widows refuse , for when wanton desires lead them away from Christ they wish to marry
54005012	and thus they incur condemnation for breaking their first promise .
54005013	At the same time they learn to be idle , going around from house to house , and not only idle , but gossips , and busybodies , saying what they should not .
54005014	I would , therefore , have the younger widows marry , bear children , keep house , give no occasion to our enemies for slander .
54005015	For already some have turned aside after Satan .
54005016	If any woman who is a believer has widows , she must provide for them and the church must not be burdened , so that it may provide for those who are really widows .
54005017	The elders who preside well should be thought worthy of double salary , especially those who labor in speaking and teaching .
54005018	For the Scripture says , " You shall not muzzle the ox while he is treading out the grain , " and the workman deserves his wages .
54005019	Against an elder do not receive an accusation unless on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
54005020	Those who are going on in sin rebuke before all , that the rest may fear .
54005021	I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these directions without prejudice , doing nothing through partiality .
54005022	Do not lay hands of ordination upon any one hastily . Have no share in the sins of other men . Keep yourself pure .
54005023	Do not keep on being a water-drinker , but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and because of your frequent ailments .
54005024	Some men's sins are conspicuous and go on before to condemnation , but the sins of some men follow after them .
54005025	Just so noble deeds are conspicuous and those that are otherwise cannot be hid .
54006001	ALL who are slaves under the yoke must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor , so that the name of God and the teaching may not be profanely slandered .
54006002	Those who have believing masters must not despise them because they are brothers , but rather work as slaves for them because those who are benefited by their good work are believers and beloved . Teach and urge these things .
54006003	If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree to wholesome words , those of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to religious teaching ,
54006004	he is conceited , knowing nothing , but morbidly fond of disputes and controversies from which come envy , strife , abusive language , wicked suspicions ,
54006005	and wranglings of men of depraved minds who are destitute of the truth . They think of religion as a source of gain .
54006006	Religion with contentment is a great source of gain .
54006007	For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot carry anything out .
54006008	If we have food and clothing we will be content with these .
54006009	But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and injurious passions which plunge men into destruction and ruin .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . Some men grasping for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pangs .
54006011	But you , O man of God , must shun this . Pursue righteousness , piety , faith , love , endurance , gentleness .
54006012	Play the grand hard game of the faith . Lay hold on life eternal , to which you have been called and have made the noble confession before many witnesses .
54006013	I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all , and Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the noble confession ,
54006014	to keep the commandment stainless and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
54006015	which in due time he will show , who is the blessed and only Potentate , the King of kings and Lord of lords ,
54006016	who alone has immortality , who dwells in light unapproachable , whom no man has seen or can see . To him be honor and power eternal ! Amen .
54006017	Command those who are rich in this world not to be haughty nor to fix their hope on uncertain wealth , but on God who provides all things richly for our enjoyment .
54006018	They must do good work , be rich in noble deeds , be generous , ready to share ,
54006019	treasuring up for themselves a good fund for the future , that they may lay hold on the life that is real .
54006020	O Timothy , guard what has been entrusted to you , turning away from profane and empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called " knowledge . "
54006021	Some while professing it have gone astray as regards the faith . Grace be with you all .
55001001	PAUL , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	to Timothy my beloved child : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I thank God whom , I serve , following in the steps of my forefathers , with a pure conscience , while I constantly mention you in my prayers night and day ,
55001004	remembering your tears and longing to see you , that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	I remember the sincere faith that is in you , which lived first in your grandmother Lois and then in your mother Eunice , and I am confident that it lives in you also .
55001006	For this reason let me remind you to kindle anew the gift of God that is in you by the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For God has not given us a spirit of fear , but of power and love and self-control .
55001008	Do not be ashamed to testify for our Lord or for me his prisoner , but join in suffering hardships for the good news as God gives power .
55001009	It is he who saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our deeds but according to his own purpose and grace , given to us in Christ Jesus ages ago
55001010	but now manifested by the appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus , who has defeated death and brought to light life and immortality by the good news .
55001011	For this I was made a herald and an apostle and a teacher ,
55001012	and for this reason I am suffering these things . But I am not ashamed , for I know in whom I have put my faith , and am confident that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day .
55001013	Hold to the example of wholesome words which you heard from me in faith and love in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us the precious trust committed to you .
55001015	You know that all of those in Asia have deserted me . Among them are Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	The Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus , for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chain ;
55001017	but when he came to Rome he looked me up eagerly and found me .
55001018	The Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day ! And in how many ways he served me in Ephesus you know better still .
55002001	YOU , therefore , my child , must be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus ,
55002002	and the things you heard from me , which came through many witnesses , you must commit to trustworthy men who will be able to teach others also .
55002003	Take your share of hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No one while serving as a soldier entangles himself in the affairs of life , for the soldier must please him who enlisted him .
55002005	And if any one enters an athletic contest , he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules .
55002006	The farmer who does the labor ought first to have his share of the fruits .
55002007	Think over what I am saying , for the Lord will give you insight in all things .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , raised from the dead , a descendant of David , as my good news teaches .
55002009	In telling it I am suffering hardships even to chains , as if I were an evildoer , but God's message is not chained .
55002010	For this reason I am enduring all for the sake of the chosen , that they may gain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
55002011	Trustworthy is the saying , " For if we have died with him we shall also live with him ;
55002012	if we endure we shall also be kings with him ; if we disown him , he will disown us ;
55002013	if we are faithless , he remains faithful ; for he cannot disown himself . "
55002014	Remind them of these things , charging them before God not to engage in controversy to no profit , but to the ruin of the hearers .
55002015	Be earnest in presenting yourself to God as a tested man , a workman who has no cause to be ashamed , rightly handling the message of truth .
55002016	But shun profane and empty talk . It will grow into greater impiety ,
55002017	and its teachings will spread like a gangrene . Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort .
55002018	They have gone astray as to the truth , saying that the resurrection has already taken place , and they are overthrowing the faith of some .
55002019	However , God's solid foundation stands , with this inscription , " The Lord knows his own , " and , " Let every one who names the Lord's name turn from wickedness . "
55002020	In a great house there are not only utensils of gold and silver , but also of wood and earthenware , and some are for honorable and others for dishonorable uses .
55002021	If any one keeps himself pure from these errors , he will be ready for honorable use , holy , fit for the master's service , prepared for every good work .
55002022	But flee the passions of youth and pursue righteousness , faith , love , peace , in the company of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
55002023	Avoid foolish disputes of the uneducated , knowing that they give rise to quarrels ,
55002024	and the servant of the Lord must not quarrel , but be courteous to all , skillful in teaching , forbearing ,
55002025	instructing opponents with gentleness , for God may give them a change of heart which will lead them to knowledge of the truth ,
55002026	and they may return to soberness and escape the snare of the Devil when captured by the Lord's servant to do the Lord's will .
55003001	I WOULD have you know this , that in the last days trying times will come ;
55003002	for people will be lovers of self , lovers of money , boasters , haughty , abusive , disobedient to parents , ungrateful , profane ,
55003003	without family affection , relentless , slanderers , without self-control , brutal , haters of good ,
55003004	treacherous , reckless , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God .
55003005	They will have a form of religion , but will cast off its power . Avoid such people .
55003006	For of this class are those who make their way into houses and take captive weak women loaded with sins , led by varying passions ,
55003007	always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
55003008	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so these men oppose the truth , depraved in mind , proved to be worthless as regards the faith .
55003009	But they will go no further , for their folly will be manifest to all as that of Jannes and Jambres became .
55003010	But you have kept track of my teaching , my course of life , my purpose , my faith , my slowness to anger , my love , my patience ,
55003011	my persecutions , my sufferings — what happened to me at Antioch , Iconium , Lystra , what persecutions I underwent . But the Lord delivered me out of all of them .
55003012	And all who are determined to live religiously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted .
55003013	Wicked men and impostors will go on from bad to worse , deceiving and being deceived .
55003014	But you must stand by what you learned and were persuaded of , knowing from whom you learned it
55003015	and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which can give you wisdom to gain salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All Scripture is divinely inspired and is useful for teaching , for proof , for correction of error , for education in righteousness ,
55003017	that the man of God may be complete , equipped for every good work .
55004001	I CHARGE you before God and Christ Jesus , who will soon judge the living and the dead , and by his appearing and his kingdom :
55004002	proclaim the message , be at it in season and out of season , convince , rebuke , encourage , with all patience in teaching .
55004003	For there will be a time when they will not endure wholesome teaching , but following their own fancies and wishing to have their ears tickled , they will get a crowd of teachers .
55004004	They will turn their ears away from the truth and give attention to myths .
55004005	But you must be calm in all circumstances , suffer hardships , do the work of a bringer of the good news , carry out fully all the duties of your office .
55004006	For I am already being poured out like a drink offering , and the time of my departure is near .
55004007	I have played the grand hard game , I have finished my race , I have kept the faith .
55004008	Now the crown of righteousness is awaiting me . The Lord the righteous judge will give it to me on that day , and not only to me but to all those who have loved his appearing .
55004009	Make haste to come to me quickly .
55004010	For Demas deserted me because he loved the present world and has gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Luke alone is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , for he is useful to me in service .
55004012	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus , and the books , and particularly the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith showed much ill will toward me . The Lord will repay him according to his deeds .
55004015	Be on your guard against him , for he strongly opposed our teachings .
55004016	At my first defense no one came to my help ; all deserted me . May it not be laid up against them !
55004017	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that through me the proclamation might be fully published and all the Gentiles might hear it , and I was saved from the mouth of the lion .
55004018	The Lord will rescue me from every wicked attack and will keep me safe for his heavenly kingdom . To him be glory for the ages of the ages ! Amen .
55004019	Give my greetings to Prises and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed at Corinth . Trophimus I left at Miletus , sick .
55004021	Try to come before winter . Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren send their greetings to you .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you all .
56001001	PAUL , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to promote the faith of God's chosen and their knowledge of the truths of religion ,
56001002	in hope of life eternal , which the God who never lies promised ages ago
56001003	but in due time made known as his message through the proclamation with which I was entrusted by the commission of God our Savior ,
56001004	to Titus my true child in our common faith : Grace and peace from God the Father , and from Christ Jesus , our Savior .
56001005	For this reason I left you in Crete : to arrange the things that are lacking and appoint elders in every city as I directed you ,
56001006	wherever there is a man of irreproachable character , true to one woman , with believing children who are not charged with dissolute conduct and not unruly .
56001007	For a bishop , as God's steward , must be above reproach , not self-willed , not quick-tempered , not given to wine , not given to blows , not eager for base gain ,
56001008	but hospitable , a lover of good , self-controlled , just , holy , temperate ,
56001009	holding to the trustworthy message which is according to the teaching , so that he may be able also to encourage others by wholesome teaching and to refute opposers .
56001010	For there are many insubordinate persons , foolish talkers and deceivers , especially those who are of the circumcision ,
56001011	who ought to be silenced , for they are upsetting whole house-holds , teaching what they should not , merely for the sake of base gain .
56001012	One of themselves , a prophet of their own , said , " Cretans are always liars , base brutes , lazy gluttons . "
56001013	This testimony is true . For this reason rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ,
56001014	not giving attention to Jewish myths and rules laid down by men who are turning away from the truth .
56001015	To the pure all things are pure ; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure . Even their minds and consciences are polluted .
56001016	They profess to know God , but by their deeds they disown him . They are detestable , disobedient , and worthless for any good work .
56002001	YOU must speak to them of the matters which should have a place in wholesome teaching .
56002002	Tell the older men to be temperate , dignified , self-controlled , sound in faith , in love , in patience .
56002003	Tell the older women , in the same way , to be reverent in behavior , not slanderers , not enslaved to much wine , teachers of what is noble ,
56002004	that they may train the young women to be loving wives and loving mothers ,
56002005	self-controlled , pure , home-workers , kind , submissive to their own husbands , that God's message may not be slandered .
56002006	Urge the younger men , in the same way , to practice self-control in everything .
56002007	Make yourself an example of good works , sincerity in teaching , dignified behavior
56002008	and wholesome talk that is above censure , that our opponents may be ashamed , having nothing evil to say about us .
56002009	Tell slaves to be submissive to their own masters in all things and to try to please them , not answering back ,
56002010	not pilfering , but showing all kindly fidelity , so as to make the teaching about God our Savior seem beautiful in all respects .
56002011	For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all men ,
56002012	teaching us to renounce all irreligion and worldly passions and to live soberly , justly and piously in this present world ,
56002013	waiting for the blessed hope , the glorious appearing of the great God and of our Savior Christ Jesus ,
56002014	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all sin and purify us as his own people earnest in honorable work .
56002015	Tell them these things , urge , convince with all authority ; let no one slight you .
56003001	REMIND them to be submissive to ruling authorities , to be obedient , to be ready for every good work ,
56003002	to speak abusively to no one , to be peaceable , to be fair , showing all gentleness toward all men .
56003003	For we ourselves were once thoughtless , disobedient , astray , enslaved to passions and various pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful and hating one another .
56003004	But when the kindness of our Savior , God , and his love to men appeared ,
56003005	" not because of works that we had done in righteousness , but out of his own mercy he saved us through the bath of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit
56003006	which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
56003007	that we might be declared righteous by his grace and become heirs with the hope of life eternal . "
56003008	That is a trustworthy saying . I wish you to insist on these things so that those who have put their faith in God may give earnest attention to honorable work . These things are honorable and also useful to men .
56003009	But avoid foolish disputes and genealogies and strife and quarrels about the Law ; for they are unprofitable and futile .
56003010	If a man is factious , after one or two warnings , have nothing more to do with him ,
56003011	knowing that such a one is perverted and goes on sinning though self-condemned .
56003012	When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus , try to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to pass the winter there .
56003013	Do your best in helping Zenas , the lawyer , and Apollos forward on their journey so that they may lack nothing .
56003014	Our people too must learn to give attention to honorable work , so as to be able to meet pressing needs , that they may not be fruitless .
56003015	All who are with me send you their greetings . Give our greetings to those who love us in the faith . Grace be with all of you .
57001001	PAUL , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon , our beloved fellow worker ,
57001002	and to Apphia , our sister , and to Archippus , our fellow soldier , and to the Church that meets at your house :
57001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers ,
57001005	for I hear of the love and the loyalty that you have to the Lord Jesus Christ and to all the holy .
57001006	I pray that your fellowship in the faith may become effective in the knowledge of all the good there is in us in our relation to Christ .
57001007	For I have had great joy and encouragement in your love , because the hearts of the holy have been refreshed by you , brother .
57001008	Therefore , though I might have great boldness in Christ to command you what is fitting ,
57001009	I beg you rather for love's sake , as Paul the old man and now the prisoner of Christ Jesus —
57001010	I beg you in behalf of my child Onesimus , born to me in my chains ,
57001011	who once was useless to you , but now is useful to you and to me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you , though he is my very heart .
57001013	I should like to have him for my own , to serve me in my chains for the good news , as your representative ,
57001014	but without your consent I am unwilling to do anything , so that your goodness may not be of necessity but of free will .
57001015	Perhaps it was for this that he was separated from you for a time , that you might have him back for ever ,
57001016	no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a brother beloved , especially to me , but how much more to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
57001017	If then you hold me for a partner , receive him as you would me .
57001018	If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything , charge that to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , write it with my own hand . I will pay it — not to mention to you that you owe me your own self besides .
57001020	Yes , brother , let me have this help from you in the Lord ; refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	I am writing to you confident of your obedience and knowing that you will do more than I say .
57001022	At the same time I want you to prepare a lodging for me , for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given back to you .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus ,
57001024	and Mark , Aristarchus , Demas and Luke , my fellow workers , send you their greetings .
57001025	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits .
58001001	MANY times and in many ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets ;
58001002	but at the end of these days he has spoken to us by a Son , whom he has appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the world ,
58001003	who is the reflection of his glory and the expression of his nature and sustains all things by his word of power , and who , when he had made purification from sins , took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,
58001004	having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited surpasses theirs .
58001005	For to which of the angels did he ever say , " Thou art my son ; I have to-day become thy Father " ? and again , " I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a Son " ?
58001006	And again when he brings his first-born into the world of men he says , " And let all the angels of God bow down to him . "
58001007	Referring to the angels he says , " He makes his angels winds , his servants a flame of fire . "
58001008	But regarding the Son he says , " Thy throne , O God , is forever and ever . Thy royal scepter is a scepter of justice .
58001009	Thou lovest righteousness and hatest lawlessness , therefore God , thy God , has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy companions . "
58001010	And , " Thou , in the beginning , O Lord , didst found the earth , and the heavens are works of thy hands .
58001011	They will perish , but thou wilt endure . They all will grow old like a garment
58001012	and like a mantle thou wilt roll them up . But thou art the same and thy years will never end . "
58001013	To which of the angels did he ever say , " Sit at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool " ?
58001014	Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for service in behalf of those who are to inherit salvation ?
58002001	FOR this reason we should give special attention to the things that we have heard , so as not to drift away from them .
58002002	For if the message spoken through angels was sure and every violation and disobedience received merited punishment ,
58002003	how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation , which at the beginning was spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him ,
58002004	while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and many kinds of miracles and impartation of the Holy Spirit according to his will ?
58002005	For he has not subjected to angels the coming world of which we speak .
58002006	But somewhere one says , " What is man that thou rememberest him ? Or the son of man that thou carest for him ?
58002007	Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels . With glory and honor thou hast crowned him .
58002008	All things thou hast put under his feet . " When he put all things under him he left nothing that was not put under him . We do not yet see all things put under him ,
58002009	but we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death that by the grace of God he might taste of death for every man , now crowned with glory and honor .
58002010	For it was fitting that he through whom are all things and for whom are all things , when leading many sons to glory , should make the great Leader of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
58002011	For he who makes holy and they who are made holy are all of one . For this cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
58002012	saying , " I will tell thy name to my brothers . In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to thee , "
58002013	and again , " I will trust in him , " and again , " Here am I and the children whom God has given me . "
58002014	Since then the children share in blood and flesh , he himself in the same way shared in them , in order that through death he might defeat him who had the power of death , that is , the Devil ,
58002015	and set free all those who through fear of death were all their lives doomed to slavery .
58002016	For he does not come to the help of angels , but he comes to the help of the descendants of Abraham .
58002017	And for that reason he had to be made like his brethren in everything , so as to be a compassionate and faithful high priest in things relating to God , to make propitiation for the sins of the people .
58002018	For since he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are tempted .
58003001	THEREFORE , holy brethren , sharers in a heavenly call , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession , Jesus ,
58003002	who was faithful to him who made him as also Moses was in all God's house .
58003003	For he has been thought worthy of more glory than Moses , just as he who has built a house has more honor than the house .
58003004	For every house is built by some one , but he who built all things is God .
58003005	Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant for a testimony to the things that were to be spoken ,
58003006	but Christ as a Son over his own house . We are his house if we hold firmly to the end our confidence and the hope of which we boast .
58003007	Wherefore , as the Holy Spirit says , " To-day if you will hear his voice ,
58003008	do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry on the day when they tried me in the desert ,
58003009	when your fathers put me to a test and saw my deeds for forty years .
58003010	Therefore I was much displeased with that generation and said , ' They always go astray in their hearts and they do not know my paths . '
58003011	So I swore in my wrath , ' They shall not enter into my rest . '
58003012	See to it , brethren , that there shall not be in any one of you a wicked , unbelieving heart ready to forsake the living God ,
58003013	but encourage one another daily while it is called " to-day , " that no one may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
58003014	For we become sharers with Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance with which we began .
58003015	When it is said , " To-day if you will hear his voice , do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry " —
58003016	who when they heard made him angry ? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses ?
58003017	With whom was he much displeased for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the desert ?
58003018	To whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest , except to those who had no faith ?
58003019	We see that they were unable to enter because of their lack of faith .
58004001	LET us , then , be afraid that , though the promise of entering his rest is still left , some one of you may seem to have missed it .
58004002	For we have received the good news just as they did , but the message that was heard did not benefit them , since it did not meet with faith in the hearers .
58004003	For we who have faith are entering into the rest , as he said , " As I swore in my wrath , ' They shall not enter into my rest , ' " although his works had been finished since the creation of the world .
58004004	For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day thus , " And God rested on the seventh day from all his works , "
58004005	and in this place again , " They shall not enter into my rest . "
58004006	Since , then , it remains for some to enter into it , and those who first received the good news did not enter because of lack of faith —
58004007	again he indicates a day , " to-day , " saying in David so long after , as has been already quoted , " To-day if you will hear his voice , do not harden your hearts . "
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest he would not be speaking of another day after that .
58004009	Therefore there still remains a rest for the people of God .
58004010	For he who has entered into God's rest has rested from his works as God did from his .
58004011	Let us endeavor then to enter into that rest so that no one shall fall , after that example of lack of faith .
58004012	For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword , and it pierces until it divides soul and spirit , joints and marrow , and it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart .
58004013	There is not a creature invisible to him , but all things are naked and defenseless before the eyes of him to whom we must account .
58004014	Since , then , we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession .
58004015	For we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses , for he has been tempted in every way just as we are , yet without sin .
58004016	Therefore let us come with confidence to the throne of grace and receive compassion and find grace for timely help .
58005001	FOR every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	He is able to sympathize with the ignorant and the erring , since he himself is beset with weaknesses .
58005003	For this reason he must bring an offering for his own sins , just as he does for those of the people .
58005004	And no one takes this honor upon himself unless called by God , as Aaron was .
58005005	So too Christ did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest , but he who said to him , " Thou art my Son , to-day I have become thy Father , "
58005006	and who says in another place , " Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek . "
58005007	Christ , in the days of his flesh , offered prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death , with strong outcries and tears , and was heard and saved from his terrors .
58005008	Although he was a Son he learned obedience from his sufferings ,
58005009	and being thus made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him ,
58005010	and was proclaimed by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	Regarding Melchizedek we have much to say that is hard to explain , since you have become dull of hearing .
58005012	For when , considering the time , you ought to be teachers you need to have some one teach you again the first principles of the revelations of God . You have come to need milk and not solid food .
58005013	For every one who takes milk is inexperienced in the doctrine of righteousness , for he is a child .
58005014	But solid food is for adults who through practice have their senses exercised in distinguishing good and bad .
58006001	THEREFORE let us leave elementary teaching about Christ and hasten on to what is advanced , not laying again a foundation — change of heart from dead works , faith in God ,
58006002	the teaching about baptisms , the laying on of hands , resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .
58006003	This we will do if God permits .
58006004	For it is impossible for those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit
58006005	and have tasted God's word and the powers of the coming world ,
58006006	and then have fallen away , to have again a change of heart , since they are crucifying for themselves afresh the Son of God and putting him to open shame .
58006007	For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it and bears plants useful to those for whom it is farmed shares in God's blessing ;
58006008	but if it bears thorns and thistles it is judged worthless and is near to being cursed . In the end it will be burnt over .
58006009	But we are persuaded of better things regarding you , beloved , things that belong with salvation , though we thus speak .
58006010	For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown to his name as you have served and are still serving the holy .
58006011	But we desire to have each one of you show to the end the same earnestness for the fulfillment of our hope ,
58006012	that you may not be dull , but imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises .
58006013	For God , when making the promise to Abraham , since he could swear by no one greater , swore by himself ,
58006014	saying , " Surely , I will greatly bless you and greatly multiply you . "
58006015	And so after patient waiting Abraham obtained what was promised .
58006016	For men swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all dispute .
58006017	In this case God being abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable purpose of his will gave the surety of an oath ,
58006018	that by two unchangeable things , in which it was impossible for God to be false , we might have strong encouragement , we who have fled to lay hold on the hope that lies before us .
58006019	We have this hope as an anchor of the soul , sure and firm , and it enters into the tent within the curtain
58006020	where Jesus , our forerunner , has entered in our behalf , becoming forever a high priest after the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	FOR , this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham when he was returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him ,
58007002	and to whom Abraham gave a tenth of all ,
58007003	without father , without mother , without ancestors , without either birthday or end of life , but made like the Son of God , remains a priest permanently .
58007004	But see how great this man was , since Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of his choicest spoils .
58007005	And even those of the sons of Levi who attain the priesthood have command according to the Law to take a tenth from the people , their own brethren , although these have sprung from the loins of Abraham .
58007006	But he who had no genealogy from these took a tenth from Abraham and pronounced a blessing on him who had the promises .
58007007	Without dispute the less is blessed by the greater .
58007008	And here mortal men receive tenths , but there one of whom the witness is that he is living .
58007009	And , to put it frankly , Levi , who receives the tenths , was made to pay a tenth through Abraham .
58007010	For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met Abraham .
58007011	If , then , perfection had been through the Levitical priesthood , — for on the basis of that the people received the Law — what need was there for another kind of priest to arise and not be called of the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For when the priesthood has been changed there comes of necessity also a change of law .
58007013	For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has ever had anything to do with the altar .
58007014	For it is plain that our Lord has arisen from Judah , and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests .
58007015	And this is yet more abundantly evident if after the order of Melchizedek there arises a priest of a different kind
58007016	who has become such , not according to the law of a commandment made for the flesh , but according to the power of unending life .
58007017	For it is affirmed of him , " Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek . "
58007018	There is a setting aside of the earlier commandment because of its weakness and uselessness —
58007019	for the Law brought nothing to perfection — and there is the bringing in of a better hope through which we draw near to God .
58007020	And just as it was not without an oath —
58007021	for those men have become priests without an oath , but he with an oath from him who said to him , " The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind : thou art a priest forever " —
58007022	by so much better is the covenant of which Jesus has become surety .
58007023	And many of them became priests because they were prevented by death from continuing ,
58007024	but he , because he continues forever , has an unending priesthood .
58007025	And so he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him , since he is forever living to intercede for them .
58007026	For such was the High Priest that we needed , holy , innocent , unstained , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens .
58007027	He has not the daily need , like the other priests , first to offer sacrifices for his own sins and then for those of the people . This latter he did once for all when he offered himself .
58007028	For the Law makes high priests of men who have infirmities , but the word of the oath , which comes after the Law , makes High Priest of a Son who is perfected forever .
58008001	THE chief point of what I have been saying is this : we have such a High Priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens ,
58008002	and who ministers in the holy place and in the true Tent set up by the Lord , not by man .
58008003	Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices . Whence it is necessary for this one to have something to offer .
58008004	If he were upon the earth he would not be a priest at all , since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law .
58008005	They minister as an example and shadow of the things in heaven , just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the Tent . " See , " it was said , " that you make everything according to the model shown you on the mountain . "
58008006	But now Christ has obtained a ministry as much more excellent as the covenant of which he is mediator is better and based upon better promises .
58008007	For if that first covenant had been faultless a place would not have been sought for a second .
58008008	But finding fault with it he says , " The days are coming , says the Lord , when I will make for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant ,
58008009	not in the manner of the covenant which I made with their fathers , on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt . For they did not abide by my covenant and I ceased to care for them , says the Lord .
58008010	This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord ; I will put my laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people .
58008011	They shall not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother saying , ' Know the Lord ' ; for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest of them ,
58008012	and I will be merciful to their wrong-doings and their sins I will remember no more . "
58008013	In saying " new " he has pronounced the first covenant old . But what grows old and decadent is near to disappearance .
58009001	THE first covenant had regulations of worship and its holy building in this world .
58009002	For a Tent was erected , in the first part of which were the lampstand and the table and the consecrated bread . This was called the Holy Place .
58009003	Behind the second curtain was the part called the Holy of Holies .
58009004	It had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant all covered with gold . In this was a golden jar with the manna and Aaron's rod that sprouted and the tablets of the covenant .
58009005	Above it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of propitiation . Regarding these things it is not now possible to speak in detail .
58009006	But these things being thus arranged , the priests go constantly into the first part of the Tent , performing their services ,
58009007	but into the second part the High Priest alone goes once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself and for the sins ignorantly committed by the people .
58009008	The Holy Spirit shows this , that the way into the holy place has not yet been made plain while the first Tent is standing .
58009009	That is a symbol , for the time being , in accordance with which gifts and sacrifices are offered , though they cannot make the worshiper perfect in his conscience ,
58009010	since they consist only of foods and drinks and various baths — rules respecting the flesh , imposed until the time of reformation .
58009011	But when Christ came as High Priest of the good things that have come , he entered once for all through the greater and more perfect Tent not made by hands — that is , not of this creation —
58009012	and not with the blood of goats and calves , but with his own blood , into the holy place , and thereby found eternal redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the defiled , makes them holy as regards purity of their flesh ,
58009014	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through an eternal Spirit offered himself an unblemished sacrifice to God , cleanse our consciences from dead works for the service of the living God .
58009015	For this reason he is the mediator of a better covenant that , a death having taken place for redemption from sins under the first covenant , those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance promised to them .
58009016	For where there is a last will and testament the death of the testator must be put in evidence .
58009017	For a will is valid in the case of the dead : it never has any force while the testator is living .
58009018	Hence the first covenant was not introduced without blood .
58009019	When all the commands of the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled it on the book and on all the people ,
58009020	saying , " This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you . "
58009021	And the Tent and all the things used in worship he likewise sprinkled with blood .
58009022	Almost everything is cleansed with blood , according to the Law , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
58009023	It was necessary , then , that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands , a copy of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear before the face of God in our behalf .
58009025	Nor was it to offer himself often , as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood not his own ;
58009026	then he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world . But now , once for all , at the end of the ages , he has appeared to do away with sin by his sacrifice .
58009027	And as it is appointed for men once for all to die and after this comes judgment ,
58009028	so Christ was once for all offered to bear the sins of many and will appear the second time , apart from sin , to those who are looking for him , and bring them salvation .
58010001	FOR the Law with a shadow of the good things that are coming , but not the very likeness of the things , cannot , by the same sacrifices which they offer constantly every year , ever make perfect those who come ,
58010002	since would they not have ceased offering them ? Because the worshipers , once for all cleansed , would have had no consciousness of sins .
58010003	But in the sacrifices these are called to mind every year .
58010004	For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take away sins .
58010005	Therefore on coming into the world he says , " Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire : a body thou hast prepared for me .
58010006	Whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not delight in .
58010007	Then I said , ' Here I have come — in the roll of the book it is written of me — to do thy will , O God . ' "
58010008	He first says , " Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not desire nor delight in , " such as are offered according to the Law ,
58010009	and then he says , " Here I have come to do thy will . " He takes away the first to establish the second .
58010010	By this " will " we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58010011	Every priest stands daily doing service and offering many times the same sacrifices , although they never can take away sins .
58010012	But this Priest after offering one sacrifice for sins forever , took his seat at the right hand of God ,
58010013	for the future only waiting until his enemies are made his footstool .
58010014	For by one offering he has forever perfected those who are made holy .
58010015	The Holy Spirit testifies this to us ; for after having said ,
58010016	" This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their hearts and on their minds I will write them , " he adds ,
58010017	" and their sins and their law-breakings I will remember no more . "
58010018	But where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer any offering for sin .
58010019	Since we have , then , brethren , confidence in entering the holy place through the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	by the new and living way which he has made for us through the curtain , that is , his flesh ,
58010021	and since we have a great Priest over the house of God ,
58010022	let us come with true hearts in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies bathed in pure water .
58010023	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering , for he is faithful who has promised ,
58010024	and let us keep watch to incite one another to love and noble deeds ,
58010025	not neglecting to assemble yourselves , as some do , but encouraging one another , and so much the more , as you see the day drawing near .
58010026	For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there remains no longer any sacrifice for sins ,
58010027	but a dreadful expectation of doom and a fury of fire that will devour the opposers .
58010028	Any one who sets aside a law of Moses dies without pity on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58010029	Of how much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy who has trampled on the Son of God , who has thought the blood of the covenant , by which it was made holy , an unholy thing , and who has insulted the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know him who said , " Vengeance is mine , I will repay , " and again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
58010031	It is dreadful to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	Remember the early days in which , after being enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ,
58010033	at one time made a public spectacle by reproaches and distresses , at another time making common cause with those who were thus treated .
58010034	For you even suffered with the prisoners and accepted the plundering of your property with joy , knowing that you had a better and enduring possession .
58010035	Do not , then , cast away your confidence , for it will have a great reward .
58010036	You have need of patience so that after doing the will of God you may gain the promised blessing .
58010037	For yet " a little , very little , while , and he who is coming will come and will not delay .
58010038	My righteous man will live by faith ; but if he shrinks back , my soul has no delight in him . "
58010039	But we are not of those who shrink back and perish , but of those who have faith and will win their souls .
58011001	FAITH is an assurance of things hoped for , a conviction of things not seen .
58011002	By this the men of old won their fame .
58011003	By faith we understand that the worlds came into order at the word of God , so that what is now seen did not come out of things that are visible .
58011004	By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain , for which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous , God testifying to his gifts , and by it , though dead , he still speaks .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken from the earth so that he did not see death , and he was not found because God had taken him . For before being taken he had this testimony that he had pleased God .
58011006	But without faith it is impossible to please him . For he who comes to God must have faith that he exists and that he becomes the rewarder of those who seek him .
58011007	By faith Noah , after receiving a divine warning regarding things as yet unseen , reverently built an ark for the saving of his household . Thus he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness of faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham when called obeyed and came out into the place which he was to obtain for an inheritance . He came out not knowing where he was coming .
58011009	By faith he made his home in the promised land as in a foreign country , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise .
58011010	For he was looking for the city that has the foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
58011011	By faith Sarah received power to conceive a child even when past the natural time of life , since she thought him trustworthy who had given the promise .
58011012	And so from just one man , already dead in that respect , there sprang descendants " as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand on the seashore innumerable . "
58011013	These all died in faith , not having obtained the promised blessings , but they saw them and greeted them afar and confessed that they were strangers and foreigners in the land .
58011014	For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a fatherland .
58011015	And if they had been thinking of that land from which they came they would have had opportunity to return .
58011016	But now they desire a better land , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed of them — of being called their God ; for he has prepared for them a city .
58011017	By faith Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises began offering his only son
58011018	regarding whom it had been said , " Those only whose descent is through Isaac shall be called your descendants . "
58011019	He reasoned that God was able to raise him even from the dead , and figuratively he did win him back from the dead .
58011020	By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau and spoke of things to come .
58011021	By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning on the top of his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph , when at his end , mentioned the departure of the children of Israel and gave orders regarding his own bones .
58011023	By faith Moses at his birth was hidden three months by his parents , because they saw that the child was beautiful , and they did not fear the king's command .
58011024	By faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter .
58011025	He chose rather to suffer hard-ship with the people of God than to enjoy the brief pleasure of sin ,
58011026	and he thought the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt . For he was looking to the final reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the king's anger ; for he endured as if seeing him who is unseen .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood , so that the destroyer might not touch their first-born .
58011029	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as on dry land ; but the Egyptians when they tried to do so were drowned .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab , the prostitute , did not perish with those who had refused to believe ; because she had welcomed the spies with peace .
58011032	And what shall I say further ? Time would fail me to tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , and of David and Samuel and the prophets ;
58011033	who through faith struggled against kingdoms and subdued them , did deeds of righteousness , obtained promised blessings , shut the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness grew strong , became mighty in war , turned back armies of foreigners .
58011035	Women received back their dead by a resurrection . Others were tortured , refusing to pay for liberation , in order to gain a better resurrection .
58011036	Still others had experience of mockings and floggings , yes , of chains and prisons .
58011037	They were stoned , afflicted , sawn in two , murdered with the sword . They went about in sheepskins , in goatskins , destitute , distressed , maltreated .
58011038	The world was not worthy of them . They wandered in deserts and mountains , in caves and in holes in the earth .
58011039	All these won God's approval by their faith . Yet they did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise .
58011040	In reference to us God had something better in view , that they without us should not reach perfection .
58012001	THEREFORE , surrounded as we are by so great a cloud of witnesses , let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily besets us , and let us run with patience the race that lies before us ,
58012002	looking to Jesus the beginner and finisher of our faith , who for the joy set before him endured a cross , thinking little of the shame , and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Think of him who endured such hostile speaking of sinners against him , that you may not grow weary and despondent in heart .
58012004	You have not yet resisted to blood in the contest against sin ,
58012005	and you have forgotten the encouragement which reasons with you as with sons , " My son , do not think slightingly of the discipline of the Lord and be not faint-hearted when reproved by him :
58012006	for whom the Lord loves he disciplines and scourges every son whom he receives as his own . "
58012007	It is for discipline that you are enduring . God is laying it upon you as upon sons . For what son is there whom his father does not discipline ?
58012008	But if you are without discipline , in which all share , then you are bastards and not sons .
58012009	Besides , we had fathers of our flesh who disciplined us and we used to reverence them . Shall we not much more be submissive to the Father of our spirits and live ?
58012010	For they for a few days disciplined us as seemed good to them , but he for our profit , that we may share his holiness .
58012011	All discipline for the time being seems not joyous but grievous , but afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have passed through its training .
58012012	So raise the relaxed hands and straighten the unstrung knees
58012013	and make straight paths for your feet , so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint but rather cured .
58012014	Follow after peace with all men and holiness , without which no one will see the Lord .
58012015	Be on your guard that no one shall fail of the grace of God , that no bitter root shall sprout up and trouble you and through it many be stained ,
58012016	that there shall be none unchaste , or profane like Esau , who for one meal sold his birthright .
58012017	For you know that afterward when he wished to inherit the blessing he was rejected , for he found no place for a change in his father's mind though he sought it earnestly with tears .
58012018	For you have not come to something that may be touched , ablaze with fire , and to blackness and darkness and tempest
58012019	and the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which those who heard begged not to have spoken of them .
58012020	For they could not bear the command , " If even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned . "
58012021	And so dreadful was the sight that Moses said , " I am terrified and trembling . "
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God , heavenly Jerusalem , to tens of thousands of angels ,
58012023	to the festal assembly and congregation of first-born who are enrolled in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect ,
58012024	and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant and to the sprinkled blood which tells something better than the blood of Abel .
58012025	Beware of rejecting him who is speaking . For if those did not escape who rejected him who taught the divine will on earth , much less shall we if we reject him who speaks from heaven .
58012026	His voice then shook the earth , but now he has announced , " Yet once for all I shall shake not only the earth but also heaven . "
58012027	And this expression " yet once for all " shows the removal of the things shaken , as of things that have been made , that the unshaken things may remain .
58012028	So then , since we are receiving an unshaken kingdom , let us have grace by which we may worship God acceptably with reverence and awe .
58012029	For our God is a consuming fire .
58013001	LET brotherly love continue .
58013002	Do not forget hospitality : for by this some have , without knowing it , had angels as their guests .
58013003	Keep in mind the prisoners , as if you were their fellow prisoners , and those who are suffering hardships , since you yourselves are also in the body .
58013004	Let marriage be held in honor by all and let the bed be undefiled ; for unchaste persons and adulterers God will judge .
58013005	Let your lives be free from the love of money . Be content with what you have . For he has said , " I will not fail you nor will I forsake you . "
58013006	So we may say with courage , " The Lord is my helper ; I will not fear . What can man do to me ? "
58013007	Remember your leaders , those who have spoken to you God's message , think how they ended their lives and imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the same — yes , and through the ages .
58013009	Do not be carried away with all sorts of foreign teachings . It is well to have the heart strengthened by grace , not by special kinds of food . Those who live in that way are not profited .
58013010	We have an altar of which those who worship in the Tent have no right to eat .
58013011	For the bodies of the animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the High Priest are burned outside the camp .
58013012	For this reason Jesus also , to make the people holy by his own blood , suffered outside the gate .
58013013	Let us go out to him outside the camp and bear the reproaches cast on him .
58013014	For we have here no continuing city , but we are seeking the coming one .
58013015	Through him then let us offer to God always the sacrifice of praise , that is , the fruit of lips that make confession in his name .
58013016	Do not forget kindness and generosity , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
58013017	Obey your leaders and yield to their authority ; for they watch over your souls as those who must give account , that they may do it with joy and not with sighing . That would be unprofitable for you .
58013018	Pray for us : for we are confident that we have a good conscience , wishing to live nobly in every way .
58013019	I earnestly beg you to do this that I may be restored to you the sooner .
58013020	May the God of peace , who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus , the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of an eternal covenant ,
58013021	equip you with every good thing for doing his will , doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory for the ages of the ages . Amen .
58013022	I beg you , brethren , to bear with my words of exhortation ; for I have written to you briefly .
58013023	I wish you to know that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty . With him , if he comes soon , I will see you .
58013024	Give my greetings to all your leaders and all the holy . Those who are from Italy send their greetings to you .
58013025	Grace be with you all .
59001001	JAMES , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the Twelve Tribes which are scattered in foreign lands : Greeting .
59001002	Think it all joy , my brethren , when you fall into all sorts of trials ,
59001003	since you know that the testing of your faith brings out endurance .
59001004	Let endurance do its complete work , that you may be complete and perfect , lacking in nothing .
59001005	If any one of you is lacking in wisdom , let him ask it from God , who gives to all freely without reproaching , and it will be given to him .
59001006	But he must ask in faith with never a doubt . For he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed .
59001007	For that man must not think that he will obtain anything from the Lord —
59001008	a two-minded man unsteady in all his ways .
59001009	Let the lowly brother glory in his high station ,
59001010	and let the rich brother glory in his lowly station , for he will pass away like a flower of the grass .
59001011	For the sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the grass , and the flower of it falls and the beauty of its face perishes . So shall the rich man wither in his pursuits .
59001012	Blessed is the man who endures trial , for when he has been tested he will gain the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him .
59001013	No one must say when tempted , " My temptation comes from God . " For God cannot be tempted by evil , and he tempts no one .
59001014	Every one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own passions and enticed .
59001015	Then when passion has conceived it gives birth to sin , and sin , when it is full grown , gives birth to death .
59001016	Make no mistake , my beloved brethren ,
59001017	every good gift and every perfect boon is from above ; it descends from the Father of lights , with whom there is no change or shadow caused by turning .
59001018	Of his own will he made us his children through the message of truth , so that we might be a sort of first fruits of his creatures .
59001019	I wish you to know this , my beloved brethren : Every man must be quick to hear , but slow to speak , slow to anger .
59001020	For a man's anger does not work out God's righteousness .
59001021	So lay aside all that is vile and all that remains of malice , and receive with gentleness the implanted message which can save your souls .
59001022	Become doers of the message and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
59001023	For if one is a hearer of the message and not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror .
59001024	He looks at himself and is gone , and immediately forgets what sort of man he was .
59001025	But he who looks earnestly into the perfect law of liberty and continues to do so , and becomes not a forgetful hearer but a doer of work — that man will be blessed in what he does .
59001026	If any one thinks himself religious while he does not bridle his tongue , but deceives his own heart , that man's religion is worthless .
59001027	Pure and stainless religion in the sight of God the Father is to visit orphans and widows in their trouble and to keep one's self unspotted from the world .
59002001	MY brethren , do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality for persons .
59002002	For if there comes into your assembly a man with gold rings and in fine clothes , and there comes in a poor man in soiled clothes ,
59002003	and you look up to the man who is wearing the fine clothes and say , " Take this good seat , " and say to the poor man , " Stand there , " or " Sit under my footstool , "
59002004	are you not making distinctions in your own minds and have you not become judges with wicked thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my beloved brethren , did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor man . Do not the rich oppress you and drag you before courts ?
59002007	Do they not speak profanely of the noble name by which you are called ?
59002008	If you keep the royal law according to the Scripture , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , " you do well .
59002009	But if you have partiality , you commit sin and are convicted by the law as law-breakers .
59002010	For he who keeps the whole law , but stumbles in one point , has become guilty of all .
59002011	For he who said , " Thou shalt not commit adultery , " said also , " Thou shalt not commit murder . " If you do not commit adultery , but do commit murder , you have become a law-breaker .
59002012	So speak and so act as those who are soon to be judged by a law of liberty .
59002013	For judgment is merciless to him who has shown no mercy . Mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	Of what use is it , my brethren , for any one to say that he has faith , if he has not works ? Can faith save him ?
59002015	If a brother or sister is naked and lacks food for the day
59002016	and one of you says to them , " Go in peace , be warmed and fed , " but you do not give them what the body needs , what is the good of it ?
59002017	Just so faith by itself , if it has no works , is dead .
59002018	But some one will say , " You have faith and I have works . Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works . "
59002019	You have faith that there is one God . You do well . Even the demons have that faith , and they shudder .
59002020	Are you willing to learn , O vacant-minded man , that faith without works is useless ?
59002021	Was not Abraham , our father , pronounced righteous because of works when he laid Isaac his son on the altar ?
59002022	You see that faith worked with his works , and by works faith was made perfect
59002023	and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , " Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness " and he was called " God's friend . "
59002024	You see that a man is pronounced righteous because of works and not because of faith alone .
59002025	In the same way was not Rahab , the prostitute , pronounced righteous because of works when she had received the messengers and sent them out by a different road ?
59002026	For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead .
59003001	DO not , many of you , become teachers , my brethren , for you know that we will receive severer judgment .
59003002	For in many ways we all stumble . If any one never stumbles in his talk , he is a perfect man , able to bridle also the whole body .
59003003	If we put bits into the horses ' mouths to make them obey us , we turn about their whole bodies .
59003004	See the ships ; great as they are and driven by violent winds , they are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the desire of the helmsman chooses .
59003005	Just so the tongue is a small member , but boasts of great things . Think how small a fire may be and yet how vast the forest that it may set ablaze .
59003006	And the tongue is a fire , a world of wickedness . The tongue stands among our members as that which spots the whole body and sets on fire the wheel of nature and is itself set on fire by Gehenna .
59003007	For every kind of wild beasts and birds and reptiles and animals from the sea is tamed and has been tamed by human kind ,
59003008	but the tongue no man is able to tame . It is a restless evil ; it is full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless the Lord our Father and with it we curse the men who are made in the image of God .
59003010	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing . This , my brethren , should not be so .
59003011	Does a spring pour out from the same opening sweet water and bitter ?
59003012	Can a fig tree , my brethren , bear olives , or a vine figs ? No more can salt water yield fresh water .
59003013	Who is wise and intelligent among you ? Let him show out of the noble life that he lives his works in wise gentleness .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and party-spirit in your hearts , do not boast and falsely contradict the truth .
59003015	This wisdom does not come down from on high , but is earthly , animal , demoniacal .
59003016	For where jealousy and party-spirit are , there is confusion and every base affair .
59003017	But the wisdom from on high is first pure , then peaceable , fair-minded , easily persuaded , full of compassion and good fruits , impartial , sincere .
59003018	The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace .
59004001	WHENCE come wars and whence come strifes among you ? Is it not from your pleasures which carry on war in your members ?
59004002	You long for something and do not have it . You murder and envy and cannot obtain it . You battle and war . You do not have , because of your not asking .
59004003	You ask and do not receive , because you ask wickedly to waste it on your pleasures .
59004004	You adulteresses , do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity to God ? Whoever chooses to be a friend to the world stands as an enemy of God .
59004005	Do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose ? Does the Spirit which he made dwell in us long enviously ?
59004006	But he gives greater grace . Therefore it says , " God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
59004007	Submit yourselves , then , to God . Resist the Devil and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God and he will draw near to you . Make your hands clean , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59004009	Be sorrowful and mourn and lament . Let your laughter be turned into grief and your gladness into gloom .
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you .
59004011	Do not speak against one another , brethren . He who speaks against his brother speaks against the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law , but a judge .
59004012	One is the Lawgiver and Judge — he who is able to save and to destroy . Who are you , to judge your neighbor ?
59004013	Come , now , you who say , " To-day or to-morrow we will go to such a city and spend a year and do business and make money , "
59004014	though you do not know what your life will be like on the morrow . For you are a vapor that appears for a little while and then disappears .
59004015	You should rather say , " If the Lord wills it , we shall live and do this or that . "
59004016	But now you glory in bragging . All such glorying is evil .
59004017	If any one , then , knows how to do good and is not doing it , he is committing sin .
59005001	COME , now , you rich men , wail and lament over the miseries that are coming upon you .
59005002	Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten ,
59005003	your gold and silver are rusted over and the rust on them will be an evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire .
59005004	You have laid up treasures in the last days . See , the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields , fraudulently kept back by you , call aloud , and the cries of the harvesters have come into the ears of the Lord of armies .
59005005	You have lived luxuriously in the land and have given yourselves up to pleasure . You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned , you have murdered , the righteous ; he does not resist you .
59005007	Therefore be patient , brethren , until the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the ground and is patient over it until he receives the early and the late rains .
59005008	You too must be patient . Keep your hearts steadfast , for the coming of the Lord is near .
59005009	Do not fret at one another , brethren , and then you will not be judged . The Judge is standing before your doors .
59005010	Take , brethren , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of patience in suffering evil .
59005011	We call them blessed because they endured . You have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord's dealings with him , that the Lord is very tender and compassionate .
59005012	Above all things , my brethren , do not swear , either by heaven or by the earth or by any other oath . Let your yes be yes and your no be no , that you may not fall under condemnation .
59005013	Is any one of you suffering hardship ? Let him pray . Is any one cheerful ? Let him sing with the harp .
59005014	Is any one of you sick ? Let him call in the elders of the church and let them pray over him and anoint him with olive oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	The prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise him up , and if he has committed sins they will be forgiven him .
59005016	Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another in order to be healed . The effective prayer of a righteous man has great power .
59005017	Elijah was a man of the same weaknesses as ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months .
59005018	Then he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the land brought forth its fruits .
59005019	My brethren , if one of you strays from the truth and any one brings him back ,
59005020	I wish you to know that he who brings back a sinner from his wanderings will save his soul from death and will hide a host of sins .
60001001	PETER , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the Chosen Ones of the scattered Jews in foreign lands who are living in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia and Bithynia —
60001002	chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father and made holy by the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood : Grace be to you and peace be multiplied .
60001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead —
60001004	a birth into an inheritance immortal , unstained and unfading , kept in heaven for you
60001005	who are guarded by the power of God through faith for the salvation which is ready to be revealed on the last day .
60001006	In this you rejoice , though now for a little while , if necessary , you are sorrowful in trials of many kinds ,
60001007	so that your tested faith , much more precious than gold that perishes though tested by fire , may be found to your praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed ,
60001008	whom you love though you have not seen him ; in whom you have faith though now you do not see him , and you rejoice with unspeakable and glorious joy
60001009	while you receive the reward of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
60001010	Regarding this salvation the prophets who foretold the grace that was to come to you
60001011	inquired and searched , trying to find out what time , or what sort of time , the Spirit of Christ which was in them was disclosing when it witnessed beforehand regarding the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow .
60001012	It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you , in these things which now have been announced to you through those who have told you the good news by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven — things which angels earnestly long to look into .
60001013	Therefore brace up your minds , be calm and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001014	As obedient children , do not shape your lives by the passions that ruled you in the former days of ignorance ,
60001015	but , like the Holy One who has called you , become yourselves holy in all your way of life ,
60001016	for it is written , " You shall be holy because I am holy . "
60001017	And if you call upon him as Father who impartially judges by each one's work , live out the time of your sojourn here in reverence ,
60001018	for you know that you were not ransomed with perishable things , silver or gold , from your purposeless life handed down from your forefathers ,
60001019	but by precious blood , as of a faultless , spotless lamb , the blood of Christ ,
60001020	who was foreknown before the foundation of the world , but was manifested at the end of time for your sake
60001021	who through him are faithful to God , who raised him from the dead and gave him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God .
60001022	Now that you have made your souls holy by obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love , you must love one another steadily from your hearts ,
60001023	for you have been reborn , not from mortal seed but from immortal by the living and enduring word of God .
60001024	For " All flesh is like grass and all its glory is like the flower of the grass ; the grass withers and the flower falls ,
60001025	but the word of the Lord endures forever . " And this is the word of good news that has been brought to you .
60002001	THEN lay aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and every kind of slander ,
60002002	and , like new-born babes , long for the reasonable pure milk , that by it you may grow up into salvation ,
60002003	if you have tasted that the Lord is kind .
60002004	Coming to him , a living stone , rejected by men but with the Lord chosen and precious ,
60002005	you also as living stones are built up , a spiritual house , and become a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	Therefore it is contained in Scripture , " See , I am laying in Zion a chosen stone , an honored corner stone . He who has faith in him will not be put to shame . "
60002007	To you who have faith is the " honor , " but to the unbelieving " the stone which the builders rejected — that has become the corner stone ,
60002008	a stone for the foot to strike , a rock to stumble over . " Their feet strike the message because of their unbelief , and to this they were destined .
60002009	But you are a chosen race , a kingly priesthood , a holy nation , God's own people , that you may proclaim the virtues of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light .
60002010	Once you were not a people , but now you are the people of God : once you had not found compassion , but now you have found compassion .
60002011	Beloved , I beg you , as foreigners and resident aliens , to shun the passions of the flesh which war against the soul .
60002012	Keep your daily life among the Gentiles honorable , so that , although they talk against you as if you were wrongdoers , they may , from your noble deeds that they see , glorify God on the day of inspection .
60002013	Be submissive to every human institution for the Lord's sake , whether to the king as supreme ,
60002014	or to governors as those sent by him for the punishment of wrongdoers and the praise of those who do good .
60002015	For this is the will of God — that by doing good we shall silence the ignorance of thoughtless men .
60002016	Live as free men , yet not using freedom as a cloak for wickedness , but as God's slaves .
60002017	Honor all men , love the brotherhood , reverence God , honor the king .
60002018	Household servants , be submissive with all reverence to your lords , not only to the good and fair , but also to the surly .
60002019	For this is grace if for conscience toward God any one bears pain , suffering unjustly .
60002020	For what credit is it if when you sin and are struck with the fist you are patient ? But if though doing well , you suffer and are patient , that is grace in God's sight .
60002021	For to this you were called , because Christ too suffered for you , leaving you an example that you might follow in his foot-steps .
60002022	He had done no sin , nor was deceit found in his mouth .
60002023	When he was reviled he did not revile back ; he suffered , but made no threat ; he committed himself to him who judges justly .
60002024	He bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we might die to sins and live to righteousness .
60002025	For you were going astray like sheep , but have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls .
60003001	IN the same way you wives are to be submissive to your own husbands , so that if any disbelieve the message they may be won over by the lives of their wives without argument ,
60003002	when they look at your pure , reverential behavior .
60003003	Your adornment must not be of the external kind — braiding the hair and putting on gold and wearing fine dresses ;
60003004	but the hidden personality of the heart must wear the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is in God's sight most precious .
60003005	For so of old the holy women who hoped in God adorned themselves . They were submissive to their own husbands ,
60003006	as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him Master . You have become her children when you do well and feel no terror .
60003007	In the same way , you husbands must live with your wives wisely , since woman's sex is weaker , but you must give them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life , so that your prayers may not be hindered .
60003008	Finally , all must be like-minded , sympathetic , full of brotherly love , compassionate , humble-minded ,
60003009	not repaying evil for evil or abuse for abuse , but rather blessing , for that is what you were called for — to inherit a blessing .
60003010	For " He who would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit .
60003011	He must turn away from evil and do good ; he must seek peace and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer , but the face of the Lord is against wrongdoers . "
60003013	And who is it that will harm you if you become earnest for the good ?
60003014	But if you should suffer for being righteous , you are blessed . Have no fear of them and do not be disturbed ;
60003015	but exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts and be always ready to defend yourselves to every one who asks you to give account of the hope that is in you , yet with gentleness and reverence .
60003016	Keep a good conscience that , although you are slandered , those who misrepresent your good life in Christ may be put to shame .
60003017	For it is better to suffer , if that should be God's will , for doing good than for doing wrong .
60003018	For Christ once for all died for sins , a righteous man for unrighteous men , so that he might lead us to God . He was put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ,
60003019	in which he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits
60003020	who were once disobedient , when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared , into which a few , that is eight souls , went and were saved through water .
60003021	This is a type of baptism , which now saves us — not the putting off of soil from the flesh , but the endeavor for a good conscience toward God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
60003022	Now that he has gone into heaven he is at the right hand of God , and angels and authorities and powers have been made subject to him .
60004001	SINCE , then , Christ suffered in the flesh , you also must arm yourselves with the same mind . For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ,
60004002	so that he does not go on living what remains of his time in the flesh according to human passions , but according to God's will .
60004003	The time that has passed was enough to spend doing the will of the Gentiles , when you went on in indecencies , passions , hard drinking , revelries , carousings , and lawless idolatries .
60004004	In these they think it strange that you are not running with them to the same excess of profligacy , and they slander you .
60004005	But they will have to give account to him who holds himself ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	And for this purpose the good news was told even to the dead , that they might be judged like men in the flesh , but live as God does in the spirit .
60004007	The end of all things is near . Therefore be serious and sober and give yourselves to prayer .
60004008	Above all things have earnest love to one another , for love hides a host of sins .
60004009	Be hospitable to one another without grumbling .
60004010	Let each , as he has received a spiritual gift , serve the others in that way , as good stewards of the varied grace of God .
60004011	If any one speaks , let it be as uttering the oracles of God . If any one serves , let it be from the strength that God supplies . Thus in all things let God be glorified through Jesus Christ . To him be glory and strength for the ages of the ages ! Amen .
60004012	Beloved , do not be surprised at the fiery fury that is among you , which has come to try you , as if some strange thing were happening to you .
60004013	But rejoice since to this extent you are sharing the sufferings of Christ , that when his glory is revealed you may rejoice and exult .
60004014	If you are reproached for the name of Christ you are blessed , for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you .
60004015	No one of you must suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as a wrongdoer or as a meddler in other men's affairs .
60004016	But if he suffers as a Christian he should not be ashamed , but should glorify God by that name .
60004017	For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God . And if it begins first with us , what will be the end of those who disobey the good news of God ?
60004018	If the righteous is saved with difficulty , where will the godless and sinful appear ?
60004019	So then let those who are suffering according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator .
60005001	THE elders among you I beg — I who am a fellow elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ and a sharer in the glory soon to be revealed —
60005002	I beg you to shepherd the flock of God that is among you , not because you must , but willingly , not for base gain , but eagerly ,
60005003	not lording it over your charges , but becoming examples to the flock .
60005004	Then when the chief Shepherd appears you will be repaid with the never-fading crown of glory .
60005005	In the same way you younger men must be subject to your elders . You all must put on the apron of humble service for one another . For God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble .
60005006	Humble yourselves , then , under the mighty hand of God so that he may lift you up at the right time .
60005007	Cast all your anxiety on him , for he cares for you .
60005008	Be sober , watch . Your enemy the Devil , like a roaring lion , goes about seeking some one to devour .
60005009	Resist him firm in the faith and knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being completed in your brotherhood throughout the world .
60005010	The God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory in Christ , after you have suffered a little will equip , establish and strengthen you .
60005011	To him be power for the ages of the ages ! Amen .
60005012	By Silvanus , your faithful brother , as I esteem him , I am writing to you briefly , to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God . Take your stand in it .
60005013	She who is in Babylon , chosen with you , sends her greeting to you , and so does Mark my son .
60005014	Salute one another with a kiss of love . Peace be to you all in Christ .
61001001	SIMON PETER , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have been allotted a faith as precious as ours :
61001002	Grace be to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord .
61001003	Since his divine power has given us all things helpful to life and piety through the knowledge of him who has called us by his own glory and virtue ,
61001004	and thereby great and precious promises have been granted to us , that through them you may escape the corruption that is in the world through passion and become sharers in the divine nature ,
61001005	for this very reason make it your whole endeavor to supply to your faith virtue , and to your virtue knowledge ,
61001006	and to your knowledge self-control , and to your self-control endurance , and to your endurance reverence ,
61001007	and to your reverence brotherliness , and to your brotherliness love .
61001008	For when you have these in abundance they make you to be neither idle nor fruitless regarding the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	But he who lacks these is blind , dim-sighted , and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins .
61001010	Therefore endeavor more earnestly , brethren , to make sure that you have been called and chosen . For while doing these things you will never stumble .
61001011	For so entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you .
61001012	For this reason I shall always keep reminding you of these things , although you know them and are steadfast in the truth that you have .
61001013	I think it right so long as I am in this tent to arouse you by reminding you ,
61001014	since I know that the laying aside of my tent will come soon , as our Lord Jesus Christ has made plain to me .
61001015	I will endeavor also on every occasion to make it so that after my going you shall have these things in memory .
61001016	For we were not following cunningly devised myths when we told you of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty .
61001017	For he received from God the Father honor and glory when such words as these were borne to him from the majestic glory , " This is my Son , the Beloved ; in him I delight . "
61001018	And this voice we heard borne from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	Thus have we the words of the prophets confirmed , and you will do well to give attention to them as to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts ;
61001020	since you know this first , that no prophecy of Scripture comes from any one's private interpretation ,
61001021	for prophecy never came by the will of man , but men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit .
61002001	BUT false prophets also arose among the people , just as there will be false teachers among yourselves , and they will craftily bring in deadly heresies , even disowning the Lord who bought them and bringing on themselves quick ruin .
61002002	Many will follow their shameless ways and by these the path of truth will be profanely spoken of .
61002003	In covetousness they will make gain out of you by their cunning words . But their condemnation from of old has not been inactive , and their destruction has not been sleeping .
61002004	For if God did not spare angels that had sinned , but thrust them down to Tartarus and committed them to pits of darkness to be kept for judgment ,
61002005	and did not spare the ancient world , but guarded Noah , a herald of righteousness , and seven others , when he brought the flood on the world of the ungodly ;
61002006	and if reducing to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah he condemned them to destruction , making them an example for the godless of what would come upon them ,
61002007	and rescued righteous Lot worn out by the indecent lives of the lawless , —
61002008	for that righteous man living among them was tortured day and night in his righteous soul by the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds , —
61002009	the Lord knows how to rescue the pious from trial and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the day of judgment ,
61002010	especially those who go after flesh in polluting passions , and despise lordship . They are daring , self-willed ; they do not tremble to speak insultingly of glorious beings
61002011	even where angels greater in strength and power do not bring against them an insulting charge before the Lord .
61002012	But they , like irrational creatures , born mere animals for capture and destruction , while speaking profanely of things they are ignorant of , will be corrupted by their own corruption ,
61002013	and will suffer unrighteously as the reward of their own unrighteousness . They think it pleasure to revel in the daytime . They are spots and blots as they revel in their deceptions while they feast sumptuously with you .
61002014	They have eyes engrossed with some adulteress , eyes which never cease from sin . They seduce unsteady souls . They have hearts practiced in covetousness . They are children of a curse .
61002015	Leaving the straight path they have wandered away following the path of Balaam the son of Beor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness .
61002016	But he was reproved for his sin ; a dumb beast of draught , speaking with human voice , checked the madness of the prophet .
61002017	These men are springs without water , storm-driven mists for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved .
61002018	For by speaking great empty swelling words they entrap in the passions of the flesh — wanton excesses — those who are nearly escaping from those who live in error .
61002019	While they promise them liberty they themselves are the slaves of corruption ; for by whatever any one is overcome to that he is enslaved .
61002020	For if , after they have escaped the defilement of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they have been again entangled and overcome , their last state has become worse than the first .
61002021	For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment that has been committed to them .
61002022	That has happened to them which the true proverb says , " The dog returns to his own vomit and the sow after bathing returns to wallowing in the mire . "
61003001	THIS second letter , beloved , I am writing you . In both I have tried , by awakening your memory ,
61003002	to arouse your honest minds to recall the predictions of the holy prophets and the commands of your apostles from the Lord and Savior .
61003003	First you should know this , that in the last days scoffers will come with their scoffing , living according to their own passions
61003004	and saying , " Where is his promised coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep all things remain as they have been since the beginning of the creation ? "
61003005	For they willfully forget that there were heavens of old and an earth formed out of water and through water by God's word .
61003006	By these means the world that then was was flooded with water and destroyed .
61003007	But the present heavens and the earth are by the same word treasured up and kept for fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men .
61003008	Do not forget this one thing , beloved , that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow about what he has promised , as some think of slowness , but is long-suffering toward us , wishing not to have any perish but to have all come to a change of heart .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . On that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the burning elements will be dissolved and the earth and the things in it will not be found .
61003011	Since all of these things are to be dissolved , what sort of persons ought you to be in holy lives and piety ,
61003012	you who are looking for and hastening toward the coming of the day of God , when the blazing heavens will be dissolved and the burning elements melted ?
61003013	But according to his promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness will dwell .
61003014	Therefore , beloved , since you expect this , endeavor earnestly to be found by him in peace , spotless and faultless ,
61003015	and regard the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation , as also our beloved brother Paul has written to you , according to the wisdom given to him .
61003016	So he writes in all his letters when speaking in them of these things . In those letters are some things hard to understand , and these the unlearned and unsteady twist , as they do the rest of the Scriptures , to their own ruin .
61003017	You , then , beloved , since you know these things beforehand , be on your guard not to be led away by the error of the lawless and fall from your own steadfastness ,
61003018	but grow in grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be glory now and to the day of eternity !
62001001	WHAT was from the beginning , what we have heard , what we have seen with our eyes , what we looked upon and our hands touched — it is about the Word of Life
62001002	
62001003	what wo have seen and heard we are telling you also , so that you may have fellowship with us . And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ .
62001004	We are writing this that our joy may be complete .
62001005	This is the message which we have heard from him and tell to you , God is light and in him is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we say , " We have fellowship with him , " and live in darkness , we lie and are not acting the truth .
62001007	If we live in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin .
62001008	If we say , " We have no sin , " we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness :
62001010	If we say , " We have not sinned , " we make him a liar and his message is not in us .
62002001	MY children , I am writing this to you in order that you may not sin . Even if any one sins , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ , who is righteous .
62002002	And he is an atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not for ours only but for those of the whole world .
62002003	By this we know that we have come to know him , if we keep his commands .
62002004	He who says , " I know him , " and does not keep his commands , is a liar and truth is not in him .
62002005	But whoever keeps his word , truly in him the love of God has been made perfect . By this we know that we are in him .
62002006	He who says that he is abiding in him ought himself to live as he lived .
62002007	Beloved , I am not writing a new command for you , but an old command , which you have had from the beginning . The old command is the message that you have heard .
62002008	Again I am writing a new command , which is true in him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining .
62002009	He who says that he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness still .
62002010	He who loves his brother remains in the light and there is no stumbling block in him .
62002011	He who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and knows not where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I am writing to you , little children , because your sins have been forgiven for his name's sake .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because you have conquered the Evil One . I have written to you , little children , because you have come to know the Father .
62002014	I have written to you , fathers , because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong and the message of God remains in you and you have conquered the Evil One .
62002015	Do not love the world nor the things that are in the world . If any one loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him ;
62002016	for all that is in the world , the passions of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the show and pride of life , is not from the Father , but from the world .
62002017	And the world is passing away with its passions . But he who does the will of God endures forever .
62002018	Little children , it is the last hour , and as you have heard that Antichrist is coming , even now many Antichrists have arisen . By this we know that it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us , but they were not of us , for if they had been of us they would have continued with us . But they went out so that it might be plainly seen that not all are of us .
62002020	You have an anointing from the Holy One and you all know .
62002021	I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth , but because you know it and know that no lie is from the truth .
62002022	Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? He is the Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one who denies the Son has the Father either . He who confesses the Son has the Father also .
62002024	Let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you . If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is the promise that he has promised us — the life eternal .
62002026	I am writing this to you in regard to those who are misleading you .
62002027	But as for you , the anointing that you have received from him remains in you and you have no need for any one to teach you , but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is no lie and as it has taught you , you must remain in him .
62002028	And now , little children , remain in him so that if he appears we may have confidence and not shrink in shame from him at his coming .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous , you know that every one who does righteousness has been born of him .
62003001	SEE what love the Father has bestowed on us that we should be called children of God . And so we are . The reason why tho world does not know us is that it did not know him .
62003002	Beloved , we are now children of God and it is not yet plain what we shall be . But we know that if he appears we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he is .
62003003	And every one who has this hope set upon Christ purifies himself just as Christ is pure .
62003004	Every one who commits sin commits also lawlessness ; for sin is lawlessness .
62003005	You know that Christ appeared to take away sins and in him there is no sin .
62003006	Whoever remains in him does not sin ; whoever sins has not seen him nor known him .
62003007	Little children , let no one deceive you . He who is doing righteousness is righteous as Christ is righteous .
62003008	He who is committing sin is of the Devil , for the Devil has been sinning from the beginning . For this the Son of God appeared — to undo the works of the Devil .
62003009	No one who has been born of God commits sin , for God's life-giving germ remains in him and he cannot continue sinning , because he has been born of God .
62003010	By this the children of God are plain to see , also the children of the Devil . Every one who is not doing righteousness is not of God , nor is he who does not love his brother .
62003011	For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning , that we must love one another .
62003012	Not like Cain , who was of the Wicked One and killed his brother . And for what reason did he kill him ? Because his own deeds were wicked and his brother's righteous .
62003013	Do not be surprised , brethren , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brethren . Whoever does not love remains in death .
62003015	Every one who hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has life eternal remaining in him .
62003016	By this we have come to know love — that Christ laid down his life for us , and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
62003017	But if any one has this world's goods and sees his brother in need and shuts away his sympathies from him , how can the love of God remain in him ?
62003018	Let us not love in word or in tongue , but in deed and in truth .
62003019	By this we shall know that we are of the truth and shall give confidence to our hearts in his presence ,
62003020	because if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our hearts and knows all things .
62003021	Beloved , if our hearts do not condemn us we have confidence toward God ,
62003022	and whatever we ask we receive from him , because we keep his commands and do what is pleasing in his sight .
62003023	And this is his command — to believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another as he has given us command .
62003024	He who keeps his commands remains in God and God remains in him . By this we know that God remains in us — by the Spirit which he has given to us .
62004001	BELOVED , do not trust every spirit , but test the spirits whether they are from God . For many false prophets have come out into the world .
62004002	By this we know the Spirit of God : every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God ,
62004003	and no spirit that does not confess Jesus is from God . This is the spirit of Antichrist , which you have heard is coming into the world and is already in the world .
62004004	But you are of God , little children , and have conquered them , because he who is in us is greater than he who is in the world .
62004005	They belong to the world and for that reason they speak as the world speaks and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are of God . Whoever knows God listens to us : whoever is not of God does not listen to us . In this way we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error .
62004007	Beloved , let us love one another , for love is from God , and every one who loves has been born of God and knows God .
62004008	He who does not love does not know God ; for God is love .
62004009	By this the love of God to us was made plain : that God sent his only Son into the world so that we may have life through him .
62004010	In this is love — not that we loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins .
62004011	Beloved , if God has so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God . If we love one another God abides in us and his love is made perfect in us .
62004013	By this we know that we abide in him and he in us , because he has imparted to us of his Spirit .
62004014	We have seen and we bear witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world .
62004015	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides in him and he in God .
62004016	We have come to know and have put our trust in the love which God has for us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God and God remains in him .
62004017	Thus love has been made perfect with us so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment , because as God is we also are in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love , but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has pain . He who fears has not been made perfect in love .
62004019	We love because he first loved us .
62004020	If any one says , " I love God , " and hates his brother , he is a liar . For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen .
62004021	This command we have from him , that he who loves God shall love his brother also .
62005001	EVERY one who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God , and every one who loves the father who gave him life loves every one who has received life from that father .
62005002	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God and do his commands .
62005003	For this is the love of God , our keeping his commands . And his commands are not burden-some ,
62005004	because all that is born of God conquers the world . And this is the victory that conquers the world , our faith .
62005005	Who is the conqueror of the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62005006	This is he who came through water and blood , Jesus Christ . Not with the water only , but with the water and the blood . And the Spirit is the witness , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005008	For there are three that bear witness , the Spirit and the water and the blood , and the three are in accord .
62005009	If we accept the testimony of men the testimony of God is greater ; for this is God's testimony , that he has testified regarding his Son .
62005010	He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony within himself . He who does not believe God has made him a liar ; because he has not believed the testimony which God has borne regarding his Son .
62005011	This is the testimony : that God has given to us life eternal and this life is in his Son .
62005012	He who has the Son has life ; he who has not the Son of God has not life .
62005013	I am writing this to you so that you may know that you have life eternal , you who believe in the name of the Son of God .
62005014	This is the confidence that we have toward him : that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us .
62005015	And if we know that he hears us when we ask anything , we know that we obtain the things that we have asked of him .
62005016	If any one sees his brother committing a sin that is not deadly , he must ask and God will give him life for those who are committing sin that is not deadly . There is sin that is deadly . I do not say that he should pray in behalf of that .
62005017	All unrighteousness is sin , and there is sin that is not deadly .
62005018	We know that every one who has been born of God lives without sinning , but he who was born of God keeps him , and the Evil One does not lay hold of him .
62005019	We know that we are of God and the whole world lies in the Evil One .
62005020	We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding to know him who is true , and we are in him who is true and in his Son , Jesus Christ . This is the true God and life eternal .
62005021	Little children , guard yourselves from idols .
63001001	THE Elder to the chosen Lady and her children , whom I love in truth
63001002	for the sake of the truth which remains in us and will be with us forever :
63001003	Grace , mercy , and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
63001004	I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children living in truth , as we received command from the Father .
63001005	And now I pray you , Lady , not as if writing a new command for you , but one that we have had from the beginning , let us love one another .
63001006	This is love : to live by his commands . This is the command , as you heard from the beginning that you must live by it .
63001007	For many deceivers have come out into the world and they do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh . Such a one is the deceiver and the Antichrist .
63001008	Guard yourselves so as not to lose what we have worked for , but so that you may gain a full reward .
63001009	Every one who goes forward and does not remain in the teaching of Christ is without God . He who remains in the teaching , he has the Father and the Son .
63001010	If any one comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not take him into your house and do not bid him welcome .
63001011	He who bids him welcome becomes a sharer in his wicked works .
63001012	I have much to write to you , but I will not do it with paper and ink . I hope to be with you soon and to speak face to face so that our joy may be complete .
63001013	The children of your chosen sister send greetings to you .
64001001	THE Elder to Gaius the beloved , whom I love in truth :
64001002	Beloved , I pray that in everything you may prosper and be in health , just as your soul now prospers .
64001003	For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified to your truth — that you are living in the truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this : to hear that my children are living in the truth .
64001005	Beloved , you do faithfully whatever work you do for the brethren , even when they are strangers ,
64001006	and they have testified to your love before the church . You will do well to help them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God .
64001007	For it was for the Name that they came out , taking nothing from the Gentiles .
64001008	We ought to help such men so as to be fellow workers with the truth .
64001009	I wrote something to the church ; but Diotrephes , who desires to be first among them , does not receive us .
64001010	Therefore , if I come I will bring to mind the works that he is doing , accusing us with wicked words , and not satisfied with that , neither does he receive the brethren , and he hinders those who wish to do so and expels them from the church .
64001011	Beloved , do not imitate evil , but good . He who does good is of God . He who does evil has not seen God .
64001012	Testimony has been borne to Demetrius by all and by the truth itself . We too bear testimony , and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I had much to write to you , but I will not write to you with ink and pen .
64001014	But I hope to see you shortly , and we shall speak face to face . Peace be to you . The friends send greetings to you . Greet the friends by name .
64001015	
65001001	JUDE , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James , to those who are in God the Father , beloved , kept for Jesus Christ and called :
65001002	Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you .
65001003	Beloved , although I have been making every effort to write to you regarding our common salvation , I now find it necessary to write and urge you to contend vigorously for the faith that was once for all delivered to the holy .
65001004	For certain persons have crept in , who of old were written of as predestined to this doom , godless , changing the grace of our God into profligacy and disowning our only Ruler and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65001005	I wish to remind you , although you know all things once for all , that the Lord , after saving a people from the land of Egypt , then destroyed those who had no faith ;
65001006	and angels who did not keep their own rank , but left their own abode , he has kept for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains under blackness of darkness .
65001007	So Sodom and Gomorrah , and the cities around them , which in the same way gave themselves up to unchastity and the pursuit of unnatural vices , serve as an example while they undergo the punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	Just so these dreamers defile the flesh , reject government , and speak abusively of glorious beings .
65001009	But Michael , the arch-angel , when in dispute with the Devil he was arguing about the body of Moses , did not venture to bring against him an abusive judgment , but said , " The Lord rebuke you . "
65001010	But these speak profanely of whatever they do not know , and all that physically as irrational animals they do understand , in these things they corrupt themselves .
65001011	Alas for them ! for they have traveled in the path of Cain , and for hire have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam , and have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah .
65001012	These are the hidden reefs in your love-feasts while they feast freely with you without fear , shepherds who care only for themselves , waterless clouds driven by winds , trees in autumn fruitless , twice dead , uprooted ,
65001013	wild waves of the sea foaming out their own shame , wandering stars for which the blackness of darkness is reserved forever .
65001014	Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied of these men when he said , " See , the Lord has come with ten thousand of his holy ones
65001015	to do judgment upon all and to convict all the irreverent of all their deeds of irreverence which they have irreverently done , and of all the hard things which they have spoken against him , irreverent sinners that they are . "
65001016	These men are complaining grumblers , living according to their own passions , and their mouths speak great swelling words . They show admiration for persons for the sake of their own gain .
65001017	But you , beloved , remember the words which were long ago spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
65001018	how they told you that in the latter time there would be scoffers living according to their own ungodly passions .
65001019	These are those who cause divisions , sensual and unspiritual .
65001020	But you , beloved , building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	must keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you into life eternal .
65001022	On some have pity when they are in doubt ;
65001023	pull them out of the fire and save them . Others pity with fear , hating even the tunic spotted by the flesh .
65001024	To him who is able to guard you from falling and to make you stand faultless before his glory in great joy ,
65001025	to the only God our Savior , be , through Jesus Christ our Lord , glory , majesty , might , and authority , before all time and now and for all the ages ! Amen .
66001001	A REVELATION of Jesus Christ which God gave to him , to make known to his servants things which must soon take place . He sent and made it known through his angel to his servant John ,
66001002	who bears witness to the message of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ — everything that he saw .
66001003	Blessed is he who reads , and blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep in mind what is written in it ; for the time is near .
66001004	John to the seven Churches in Asia : Grace be to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come , and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the first-born of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood ,
66001006	and made us a kingdom , priests to God his Father , to him be glory and power for the ages of the ages ! Amen .
66001007	He is coming with clouds and every eye will see him , even of those who pierced him , and all the tribes of the earth will beat their breasts because of him . Yes , Amen .
66001008	" I am the Alpha and the Omega , " says the Lord God , " who is and who was and who shall be , the Almighty . "
66001009	I , John , your brother and fellow sharer in the distresses and the kingdom and the endurance in Jesus , came to the island called Patmos , for the sake of the message of God and the testimony of Jesus .
66001010	I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a loud voice , as of a trumpet ,
66001011	saying , " What you see write in a book , and send it to the seven churches , to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea . "
66001012	I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me , and upon turning I saw seven golden lampstands
66001013	and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man , clothed in a robe that reached his feet , and girded across the breast with a golden girdle .
66001014	His head and his hair were white , like white wool , like snow , and his eyes were like a flame of fire ,
66001015	and his feet were like fine brass when molten in a furnace , and his voice was like the sound of many waters .
66001016	He had in his right hand seven stars , and from his mouth there issued a sharp two-edged sword . His face was like the sun shining in full strength .
66001017	When I saw him I fell at his feet as if dead . But he laid his right hand on me and said : " Do not fear . I am the first and the last
66001018	and the living one . I became dead , but now I am living for the ages of the ages , and I have the keys of death and of Hades .
66001019	Write what you have seen , and what is and what is to be hereafter —
66001020	the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands . The seven stars are angels of the seven churches , and the seven lampstands are seven churches .
66002001	" To the Angel of the Church in Ephesus write : " These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamp-stands :
66002002	I know your works and your labor and your endurance , and that you cannot bear wicked people , and you have tried those who say that they are apostles though they are not , and you have found them liars .
66002003	You have endurance and you have borne for the sake of my name and you have not been discouraged .
66002004	But I have this against you , that you have lost your first love .
66002005	Remember then from where you have fallen , and repent and do your former works . Otherwise I am coming to you and will move your lampstand from its place , if you do not repent .
66002006	But you have this , that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
66002007	Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God .
66002008	" To the Angel of the Church in Smyrna write : " These things says the First and the Last , who died and returned to life :
66002009	I know your distress and poverty , but you are rich , and I know the profane words from those who say that they are Jews though they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Do not fear what you are soon to suffer . The Devil will soon cast some of you into prison so that you may be tested , and you will have distress ten days . Be faithful to death and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches . He who conquers will not be hurt by the second death .
66002012	" To the Angel of the Church in Pergamum write : " These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword :
66002013	I know where you live , where the throne of Satan is . Yet you are holding fast my name and did not disown faith in me even in the days when Antipas , my faithful witness , was killed beside you where Satan lives .
66002014	But I have a few things against you , because you have some who hold the teaching of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel : to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit unchastity .
66002015	And even you have some who likewise hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	Repent , therefore . Otherwise I am coming to you shortly , and I will make war upon them with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna , and I will give him a white stone , and on the stone a new name written , which no one knows but he who receives it .
66002018	" To the Angel of the Church in Thyatira write : " These things says the Son of God , he who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like fine brass :
66002019	I know your works and your love and your faith and your service and your endurance , and that your last works are more than your first .
66002020	But I have against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , and teaches and leads astray my servants to commit unchastity and to eat things sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I gave her time to repent , but she will not repent of her unchastity .
66002022	See , I will cast her into a bed and those who commit adultery with her into great distress , unless they repent of their deeds ,
66002023	and her children I will surely kill . All the churches shall know that I am he who searches hearts and will give to each of you according to your deeds .
66002024	But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira , as many as do not hold this teaching , who have not known the depths of Satan , as they say , I do not lay on you any other burden .
66002025	But hold fast what you have until I come .
66002026	He who conquers and keeps my commands to the end — I will give him authority over the nations ,
66002027	and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron , as earthenware is broken to pieces , just as I also have received from my Father .
66002028	And I will give him the morning star .
66002029	Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003001	" To the Angel of the Church in Sardis write : " These things says he who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars : " I know your deeds , that you have the name of being alive , but are dead .
66003002	Become watchful and strengthen the things that remain , which are about to die . For I have not found any works of yours complete before my God .
66003003	Remember , then , how you have received and heard , and give attention and repent . Unless you watch , I will come like a thief and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you .
66003004	But you have a few names in Sardis which have not stained their garments , and they shall walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
66003005	He who conquers shall be thus clothed in white garments , and I will not erase his name from the book of life , but will confess his name before my Father and before his angels .
66003006	Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003007	" To the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia write : " These things says the Holy , the True , he who has the key of David , who opens and no one shuts and who shuts and no one opens :
66003008	" I know your deeds . See , I have set before you an opened door which no one can shut , because you have a little power and you have kept my word and have not disowned my name .
66003009	See , I will make those from the synagogue of Satan , men who call themselves Jews when they are not but are lying — I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they shall know that I have loved you .
66003010	Because you have kept my command of patient endurance , I also will keep you from the hour of trial which is about to come on all the world , to try the inhabitants of the earth .
66003011	I am coming soon . Hold fast what you have , so that no one may take your crown .
66003012	He who conquers — I will make him a pillar in the Temple of my God and he will never go out , and I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , which is coming down from heaven from my God , and I will write on him my own new name .
66003013	Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003014	" To the Angel of the Church in Laodicea write : " These things says the Amen , the faithful and true Witness , the Beginning of the creation of God :
66003015	" I know your deeds — that you are neither cold nor hot . Would that you were cold or hot !
66003016	So because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I shall spew you out of my mouth .
66003017	Because you say , ' I am rich and have grown wealthy and lack nothing , ' and do not know that you are wretched and pitiable and poor and blind and naked ,
66003018	I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire , so that you may be rich , and white garments to put on , so that the shame of your nakedness may not be seen , and salve to anoint your eyes , so that you may see .
66003019	All that I love I rebuke and discipline . Be earnest , then , and repent .
66003020	See , I am standing at the door and knocking . If any one listens to my voice and opens his door , I will come in with him and will feast with him and he with me .
66003021	He who conquers — to him I will grant to sit with me on my throne , as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches . "
66004001	AFTER this I looked and there was an open door in heaven and the voice that I had heard at first , as if of a trumpet speaking with me , said , " Come up here and I will show you things that must come to pass hereafter . "
66004002	Immediately I became in the Spirit . A throne was standing in heaven and on the throne One was sitting .
66004003	He who was sitting there was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius . A rainbow , in appearance like an emerald , encircled the throne .
66004004	Around the throne I saw twenty-four thrones and on these thrones twenty-four elders seated , clothed in white garments and with golden crowns on their heads .
66004005	From the throne issued lightnings and voices and thunders . There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne . These are the seven Spirits of God .
66004006	Before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea , like crystal . Near the throne and around the throne there were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind .
66004007	The first living creature was like a lion , the second living creature was like a calf , the third living creature had a face like a man's , and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle .
66004008	The four living creatures have each six wings , and around and within they are full of eyes . They cease not saying day and night , " Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty , who was and is and is to come . "
66004009	And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne , who lives for the ages of the ages ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for the ages of the ages , and they cast their crowns before the throne saying ,
66004011	" Worthy art thou , our Lord and God , to receive glory and honor and power , for thou didst create all things and because of thy will they existed and were created . "
66005001	THEN I saw in the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne a book with writing inside and outside and closely sealed with seven seals .
66005002	I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the book and loose its seals ? "
66005003	But no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it .
66005004	I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , " Do not weep . The Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has conquered and can open the book and its seven seals . "
66005006	Then I saw midway between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders a Lamb standing . He seemed as if he had been slain . He had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
66005007	He came and took the book from the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne .
66005008	When he took the book the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb , each having a harp and a golden bowl full of incense , which is the prayers of the holy .
66005009	Then they sang a new song , saying , " Worthy art thou to take the book and to open its seals , for thou wast slain and didst ransom for God by thy blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation ,
66005010	and hast made them a kingdom of priests to our God , and they shall be kings on the earth . "
66005011	Then I looked and I heard the voices of many angels encircling the throne and the voices of the four living creatures and of the elders — the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands —
66005012	crying aloud , " Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing . "
66005013	And every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea , and all creatures in them , I heard saying , " To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power for the ages of the ages . "
66005014	The four living creatures said , " Amen , " and the elders fell down and worshiped .
66006001	THEN I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals and I heard one of the living creatures say , as if with a voice of thunder , " Come . "
66006002	I looked and there came a white horse , and he who was sitting on it had a bow , and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer .
66006003	When he opened the second seal I heard the second living creature say , " Come . "
66006004	Then another horse came out . It was fiery red , and to him who was sitting on it was granted to take peace from the earth so that men should kill one another , and a great sword was given to him .
66006005	When he opened the third seal I heard the third living creature say , " Come . " I looked and there came a black horse , and he who was sitting on it had a pair of scales in his hand .
66006006	I heard what seemed a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A measure of wheat for a shilling and three measures of barley for a shilling . But do no harm to the oil or the wine . "
66006007	When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , " Come . "
66006008	I looked and there came a pale yellow horse . The name of him who was sitting on it was Death , and Hades was following along with him . Authority was granted to them over one fourth of the earth , to kill with the sword and with famine and with pestilence and with the wild beasts of the earth .
66006009	When he opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the sake of God's message and because of the testimony which they had borne .
66006010	They cried with a loud voice , saying , " How long , O Ruler holy and true , wilt thou delay to judge and take vengeance for our blood upon those who dwell on the earth ? "
66006011	To each of them a white robe was given , and it was said to them that they must wait quietly yet a little while until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren was complete , who were yet to be killed as they had been .
66006012	I saw when he opened the sixth seal and there came a great earthquake and the sun became black , like sackcloth of hair , and the moon became all like blood
66006013	and the stars of heaven fell to the ground , as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind ,
66006014	and the sky passed away like a scroll when it is rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved out of its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and freeman hid themselves in the caves and the rocks of the mountains
66006016	and said to the mountains and the rocks , " Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb ,
66006017	for the day , the great day , of their wrath has come and who can stand ? "
66007001	AFTER this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind might blow on the land or on the sea or on any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel ascending from the east , with the seal of the living God . He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the land and the sea
66007003	and said , " Do not harm the land or the sea or any tree until we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads . "
66007004	I heard the number of those who were sealed , a hundred and forty-four thousand , sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel :
66007005	Of the tribe of Judah , twelve thousand sealed , Of the tribe of Reuben , twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Gad , twelve thousand ,
66007006	Of the tribe of Asher , twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Naphtali , twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand ,
66007007	Of the tribe of Simeon , twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Levi , twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand ,
66007008	Of the tribe of Zebulon , twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Joseph , twelve thousand , Of the tribe of Benjamin , twelve thousand .
66007009	After this I looked and there was a great multitude which no one could count , out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues , standing before the throne and before the Lamb clothed in white robes and with palms in their hands ,
66007010	and they shouted with a loud voice saying , " Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb ! "
66007011	And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures , and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God
66007012	saying , " Amen . Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength be to our God for the ages of the ages ! Amen . "
66007013	Then one of the elders spoke to me and said , " These who wear the white robes — who are they and where have they come from ? "
66007014	I said to him , " My Lord , you know . " He said to me , " These have come out of the great distress and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	For this reason they are before the throne of God and worship him day and night in his Temple , and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them .
66007016	They will not hunger any more nor thirst any more , nor will the sun strike on them nor any burning heat ,
66007017	for the Lamb who is in the center before the throne will be their shepherd and will lead them to springs of living water , and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
66008001	WHEN he opened the seventh seal there came a silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer , and much incense was given to him for him to put with the prayers of all the holy on the golden altar before the throne .
66008004	The smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel went up with the prayers of the holy before God .
66008005	Then the angel took the censer and filled it from the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth , and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake .
66008006	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them .
66008007	The first sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood , and it was hurled upon the earth . A third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up .
66008008	The second angel sounded his trumpet and , as it were , a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea . A third of the sea became blood
66008009	and a third of the creatures in the sea , those that had life , died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	The third angel sounded his trumpet and there fell from heaven a great star burning like a torch . It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water .
66008011	The name of the star is called Wormwood . Then a third of the waters became worm-wood , and many people died from the waters because they had been made bitter .
66008012	The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a blight fell upon a third part of the sun and a third part of the moon and a third part of the stars , so that a third part of them was darkened , and the day had no light for a third part of it , and the night was darkened in the same way .
66008013	Then I looked and I heard an eagle that was flying in mid-heaven say with a loud voice , " Woe , woe , woe to those who are living on the earth , because of the rest of the trumpet-blasts which the three angels are soon to sound ! "
66009001	THE fifth angel sounded his trumpet and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth . There was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss .
66009002	And he opened the pit of the abyss and smoke came up from the pit like the smoke of a great furnace , and the sun was darkened and the air also by the smoke of the pit .
66009003	Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth , and power was given to them such as earthly scorpions have .
66009004	It was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth nor anything green nor any tree , but only the people that did not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
66009005	It was not granted to them to kill such , but to torment them five months . Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it strikes a man .
66009006	In those days men will seek for death and will not find it and will long to die , but death will fly from them .
66009007	The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for battle . On their heads were , as it were , crowns like gold , and their faces were like human faces .
66009008	They had hair like the hair of women . Their teeth were like those of lions .
66009009	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron . The noise of their wings was like the noise of many-horsed chariots rushing into battle .
66009010	They have tails as scorpions have , and stings , and with their tails they have power to harm men five months .
66009011	They have over them a king , the angel of the abyss , whose name is in Hebrew Abaddon , but in Greek Apollyon .
66009012	One woe has passed . Two woes are still to come .
66009013	The sixth angel sounded his trumpet and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar before God
66009014	saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet , " Loose the four angels that are chained at the great river Euphrates . "
66009015	So the four angels were loosed , they who were prepared for the hour and day and month and year to kill a third of men .
66009016	The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand . I heard their number .
66009017	This is how the horses and those who sat on them appeared to me in the vision : The riders had breastplates , fiery red , dark blue , and sulphur yellow . The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions , and from their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur .
66009018	By these three plagues a third of men were killed — by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails . For their tails are like serpents with heads , and with these they do injury .
66009020	But the rest of men , who were not killed by these plagues , neither repented of the deeds of their hands nor ceased worshiping the demons and their idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk ,
66009021	nor did they repent of their murders nor of their magic nor of their unchastities nor of their thefts .
66010001	THEN I saw another strong angel descending from heaven . He was clothed in a cloud and the rainbow was over his head . His face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire .
66010002	He had in his hand a little book open . He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land
66010003	and shouted with a loud voice like the roar of a lion . When he had shouted the seven thunders spoke , each its own message .
66010004	When the seven thunders had spoken I was about to write . But I heard a voice from heaven saying , " Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken and do not write it . "
66010005	Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand to heaven
66010006	and swore by him who lives for the ages of the ages , who formed heaven and all things in it and the earth and all things upon it and the sea and all things in it , " There shall be no more delay ,
66010007	but in the days of the blast of the seventh angel , when he soon shall sound his trumpet , then the mystery of God has been finished , according to the good news that he gave to his servants the prophets . "
66010008	Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke again with me and said , " Go , take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . "
66010009	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book . He said to me , " Take it and eat it . It will make your stomach bitter , though in your mouth it will be sweet like honey . "
66010010	I took the little book from the hand of the angel and ate it , and in my mouth it was sweet like honey , but after I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter .
66010011	They said to me , " You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , tongues , and kings . "
66011001	THEN a reed like a measuring stick was given to me with the words , " Rise and measure the Temple of God and the altar and those who are worshiping at it .
66011002	But the court outside the Temple omit and do not measure it , for it has been given over to the Gentiles and they will trample down the holy city forty-two months .
66011003	I will grant to my two witnesses to prophesy a thousand , two hundred and sixty days , clothed in sackcloth .
66011004	They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	If any one wishes to harm them fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies . If any one shall wish to harm them , in this way he must be killed .
66011006	They have power to shut up heaven so that no rain shall fall during the days that they are prophesying , and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and power to smite the earth with every kind of plague as often as they please .
66011007	When they have completed their testimony , the Beast that is coming up out of the abyss will make war with them and conquer them and kill them .
66011008	Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	Men of all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses three days and a half and will not permit their corpses to be placed in a tomb .
66011010	Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and send gifts to one another , because the two prophets tormented those who live on the earth . "
66011011	After the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet . Then great fear fell on those who were looking at them .
66011012	They heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , " Come up here , " and they went up into heaven in the cloud while their enemies were looking at them .
66011013	At that hour occurred a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell and seven thousand men were killed by the earthquake . The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second Woe has passed : the third Woe will come soon .
66011015	The seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there came loud voices in heaven saying , " The kingship of the world has become our Lord's and his Christ's and he will be king for the ages of the ages . "
66011016	Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God ,
66011017	saying , " We thank thee , Lord God Almighty , who art and wast , that thou hast taken thy great power and hast become king .
66011018	The Gentiles raged , but thy wrath came and the time to judge the dead and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets and to the holy who reverence thy name , the small and the great , and to destroy those who are destroying the earth . "
66011019	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant in his temple was seen in his temple , and there came lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hailstorm .
66012001	A GREAT sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun . The moon was under her feet and on her head was a crown of twelve stars .
66012002	She was with child and cried out in the pangs and anguish of child-birth .
66012003	There appeared also another sign in heaven , a great fiery-red Dragon with seven heads and ten horns . On his heads were seven diadems
66012004	and his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and hurled them to the ground . The Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth to a child , so that he might devour the child as soon as it was born .
66012005	She gave birth to a son who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron . Then the child was caught up to God and to his throne .
66012006	The woman fled into the wilderness where she has from God a prepared place , that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days .
66012007	War arose in heaven . Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon . The Dragon and his angels fought ,
66012008	but they failed , and no place was found for them any longer in heaven .
66012009	Then was hurled down the great Dragon , the ancient serpent who is called the Devil and Satan , who misleads the whole world — he was hurled to the earth and his angels were hurled with him .
66012010	I heard a loud voice in heaven say , " Now has come the salvation and power and kingship of our God and the authority of his Christ , because the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down , he who accuses them before our God day and night .
66012011	But they have conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of testimony to him , and they loved not their lives even to death .
66012012	Therefore , rejoice , O heavens , and you who tent in them ! Alas for the land and the sea ! For the Devil has gone down to you in great wrath , knowing that he has but a little time . "
66012013	When the Dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the man-child .
66012014	Then there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle to fly into the wilderness to her place , where she shall be fed for a time and times and half a time , hidden from the view of the Serpent .
66012015	The Serpent poured from his mouth after the woman water like a river , to sweep her away with a flood .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river that the Dragon had poured out of his mouth .
66012017	Then the Dragon was enraged against the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring who keep the commands of God and hold the testimony concerning Jesus .
66013001	THEN I stood on the sand of the sea and I saw rising out of the sea a Beast with ten horns and seven heads . On his horns were ten diadems and upon his heads were profane names .
66013002	The Beast that I saw was like a leopard , but his feet were like a bear's feet and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . The Dragon gave to him his own power and his throne and great authority .
66013003	I saw one of his heads , as it were , mortally wounded , but the mortal wound was healed . The whole world followed the Beast in amazement ,
66013004	and they worshiped the Dragon because he had given such power to the Beast , and they worshiped the Beast , saying , " Who is like the Beast , and who can battle with him ? "
66013005	There was given to him a mouth speaking boasts and profanities , and there was given to him power to act for forty-two months .
66013006	He opened his mouth to insult God , to speak profanely of his name and of his Tent and of those who tent in heaven .
66013007	It was granted to the Beast to make war with the holy and to conquer them , and power was granted to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation .
66013008	All the inhabitants of the earth will worship him , all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the slain Iamb's Book of Life .
66013009	If any one has an ear let him hear .
66013010	If any one is destined to captivity , into captivity he will go . If any one is to be killed by the sword , by the sword must he be killed . Here is the endurance and the faith of the holy .
66013011	Then I saw another Beast coming up out of the land . It had two horns like those of a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
66013012	It exercises all the authority of the first Beast in his presence . It compels the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first Beast whose mortal wound was healed .
66013013	It does great signs , making fire descend from heaven to earth in the sight of men .
66013014	It leads astray the inhabitants of the earth because of the signs which it has been granted power to do in the presence of the Beast . It tells the inhabitants of the earth to make an image of the Beast which was wounded by the sword , yet lived .
66013015	Power was granted to it to give breath to the image of the Beast , so that the image of the Beast spoke and it caused all who did not worship the image of the Beast to be put to death .
66013016	It causes all , small and great , rich and poor , freemen and slaves , to have a mark put on their right hands or on their foreheads ,
66013017	so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark — the name of the Beast or the number of his name .
66013018	Here wisdom is required . Let him who has understanding count the number of the Beast ; for it is the number of a man . His number is six hundred and sixty-six .
66014001	THEN I looked and there was a Lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and the name of his Father written on their fore-heads .
66014002	I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of many waters , like the sound of loud thunder . The sound that I heard was as of harpers playing on their harps .
66014003	They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been ransomed from the earth .
66014004	These are they who were not defiled with women ; for they are virgins . They follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They were ransomed from among men as first-fruits for God and the Lamb .
66014005	No lie was found in their mouths . They are stainless .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven having eternal good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth , to every nation and tribe and tongue and people .
66014007	He said in a loud voice , " Reverence God and give glory to him , for the hour of his judgment has come , and worship him who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water . "
66014008	Another angel , a second , followed , saying , " Babylon the great has fallen , has fallen , she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of her passion for unchastity . "
66014009	Another angel , a third , followed them , saying in a loud voice , " If any one worships the Beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead and on his hand ,
66014010	he also will drink of the wine of God's passion which has been mixed undiluted in the cup of his wrath , and he will be tortured in fire and brimstone in the presence of holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb .
66014011	And the smoke of their torture will ascend for ages of ages and they will have no rest day or night — those who worship the Beast and his image , and any one who receives the mark of his name . "
66014012	Here is the endurance of the holy who keep the commands of God and the faith of Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying , " Write : Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth . " " Yes , " says the Spirit , " that they may rest from their toils . For their works follow with them . "
66014014	Then I looked and there was a white cloud , and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man . He had on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle .
66014015	Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted with a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud , " Thrust in your sickle and reap , for the hour to reap has come , for the harvest of the earth is dry . "
66014016	He who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped .
66014017	Then another angel came out from the Temple that is in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Another angel came out from the altar , he who has power over fire , and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle , " Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , for its grapes are fully ripe . "
66014019	Then the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth and flung it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
66014020	The winepress was trodden outside the city and blood came out from the wine-press as high as the horses ' bridles for a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
66015001	THEN I saw another sign in heaven . It was great and wonderful — seven angels with the seven plagues which are the last , for with them the wrath of God is fully executed .
66015002	Then I saw what was like a sea of glass mixed with fire , and those who had come victorious from the Beast and his image and the number of his name standing by the glassy sea with harps of God .
66015003	They were singing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb , saying : " Great and wonderful are thy works , Lord God Almighty . Just and true are thy ways , O King of the nations .
66015004	Who will not reverence and glorify thy name , O Lord ? For thou only art holy . All the nations will come and worship before thee , because thy righteous acts have been made manifest . "
66015005	After this I looked and the Temple of the Tent of testimony in heaven was opened ,
66015006	and the seven angels with the seven last plagues came out of the Temple , clothed in pure shining linen and girded around their breasts with golden girdles .
66015007	One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives for the ages of the ages .
66015008	The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power , and no one could enter the Temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished .
66016001	THEN I heard a loud voice saying from the Temple to the seven angels , " Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth . "
66016002	The first went away and poured his bowl upon the land , and there came an evil and malignant ulcer on the men who had the mark of the Beast and those who worshiped its image .
66016003	The second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea , and it became blood like that of a dead man and every living thing that was in the sea died .
66016004	The third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the springs of water , and they became blood .
66016005	Then I heard the angel of the waters saying , " Just art thou who art and wast , the Holy One , because thou hast so judged ,
66016006	for they poured out the blood of thy holy ones and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink . They deserve it . "
66016007	Then I heard the altar saying , " Yes , O Lord God Almighty , true and just are thy judgments . "
66016008	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was granted to him to scorch men with fire .
66016009	Men were scorched with great heat and they insulted the name of God who had power over these plagues , but they did not repent and give him glory .
66016010	The fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the Beast , and his kingdom became darkened and men bit their tongues from pain
66016011	and insulted the God of heaven for their pains and their ulcers , but they did not repent of their deeds .
66016012	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates , and its water was dried up to make a road ready for the kings from the sunrising .
66016013	Then I saw come out of the mouth of the Dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the False Prophet three impure spirits like frogs .
66016014	They are the spirits of demons who work miracles , and they go forth to the kings of the whole habitable world to gather them for the battle of the great day of God the Almighty .
66016015	" I am coming like a thief . Blessed is he who is watching and keeping his garments so that he may not go naked and people see his shame ! "
66016016	The spirits gathered them to the place called in Hebrew Har-Magedon .
66016017	The seventh angel poured out his bowl on the air , and a loud voice came from the Temple , from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
66016018	Then came lightnings and voices and thunders and a great earthquake . So great an earthquake has not occurred since man came upon the earth .
66016019	The great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the Gentiles fell . Then Babylon the Great was remembered before God — to give to her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath .
66016020	Every island fled and the mountains were not found .
66016021	And great hailstones each weighing about a hundred pounds fell from heaven on men . Men insulted God because of the hail , for the plague of it was great .
66017001	THEN came one of the seven angels that had the seven plagues and spoke with me . He said , " Come here . I will show you the doom of the great prostitute who sits on many waters
66017002	and with whom the kings of the earth have committed lewdness , while the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk with the wine of her lewdness . "
66017003	He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness . There I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast covered with profane names , and with seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls . She had in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her lewdness .
66017005	On her forehead was written a mysterious name : " Babylon the Great , the Mother of Prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth . "
66017006	I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy and with the blood of the witnesses for Jesus . When I saw her I wondered greatly .
66017007	The angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her .
66017008	The Beast which you saw was and is not and will soon come up out of the abyss and go into destruction . And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life will be amazed when they see the Beast that was and is not and will be .
66017009	Here is need for a mind that has wisdom . " The seven heads are seven mountains upon which the woman sits .
66017010	Also they are seven kings . Five have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come ; but when he comes he must stay but a little while .
66017011	The Beast which was and is not is also himself an eighth , yet is one of the seven , and will go into destruction .
66017012	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received kingly power , but they will receive power as kings for one hour with the Beast .
66017013	They have one mind and they give over their power and authority to the Beast .
66017014	They will make war with the Lamb , but the Lamb will conquer them , for he is Lord of lords and King of kings . They who are with him , called and chosen and faithful , will also conquer . "
66017015	He said to me , " The waters that you saw where the prostitute was sitting are peoples and crowds and nations and tongues .
66017016	The ten horns that you saw and the Beast — they hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and naked and they will devour her flesh and will burn her up with fire .
66017017	For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose , which is that they shall carry out one purpose and give their royal power to the Beast until the words of God are fulfilled .
66017018	The woman that you saw is the great city that has kingly power over the kings of the earth . "
66018001	AFTER this I saw another angel descending from heaven with great power , and the earth was lit up with his splendor .
66018002	He shouted with a powerful voice , saying , " Babylon the Great has fallen , has fallen , and has become a habitation of demons and a stronghold of every impure spirit and a stronghold of every unclean and detested bird .
66018003	For all the nations have drunk of the wine of her passion for lewdness and the kings of the earth have committed lewdness with her and by the excess of her luxury the merchants of the earth have grown rich . "
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying , " Come out of her , my people , that you may not take part in her sins nor receive a share in her plagues ,
66018005	for her sins have been heaped up to heaven and God has remembered her unrighteous deeds .
66018006	Repay to her as she has paid , and make it double for her deeds . In the cup she mixed mix double for her .
66018007	As much as she glorified herself and played the wanton , so much give her torture and woe . For in her heart she says , ' I sit here a queen ; no widow am I and woe I shall not see . '
66018008	For this reason in one day her plagues will come , death and woe and famine , and she shall be burned up in fire . For strong is the Lord God who has judged her .
66018009	" The kings of the earth who have committed lewdness with her and have reveled luxuriously , when they see the smoke of her burning , will wail and beat their breasts .
66018010	Standing afar because of their dismay at her torture , they will say , ' Alas , alas , O great city , Babylon the strong city , for in one hour your doom has come ! '
66018011	The merchants of the earth will weep and wail over her , for no one will any longer buy their cargoes ,
66018012	cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet , all kinds of citrus wood and their many kinds of articles of ivory and their many kinds of articles of costliest wood and brass and iron and marble ,
66018013	and cinnamon and spice and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine , and olive oil and fine flour and wheat , and cattle and sheep and horses and chariots , and bodies and souls of men .
66018014	The ripe fruits for which your soul longed have gone from you , and all your dainty and splendid things are lost to you and they will never more be found .
66018015	The traders in these things who grew rich from her will stand afar through dismay at her torture , weeping and wailing
66018016	and saying : ' Alas , alas , for the great city , clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls !
66018017	For in one hour this vast wealth has given place to desolation . ' " Every ship captain and every one who sails anywhere , and sailors and all who gain their living on the sea , stood afar
66018018	and shouted as they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , " What city could compare with the great city ? "
66018019	They threw dust upon their heads and shouted as they wept and wailed , saying , " Alas , alas , for the great city in which all who had ships on the sea grew rich from her wealth ! For in an hour she has been desolated .
66018020	Rejoice over her , O heaven , and you the holy and you apostles and prophets ! For God has pronounced sentence in your behalf against her . "
66018021	Then one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and hurled it into the sea , saying , " With such violence shall Babylon the great city be hurled down and she will never more be found .
66018022	The music of harpers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will never more be heard in you . No master of any art will ever more be found in you . The sound of the mill will never more be heard in you .
66018023	The light of a lamp will never more shine in you . The voices of bridegroom and bride will never again be heard in you . Your merchants were the great ones of the earth ; for by your magic arts all the nations were led astray .
66018024	In her was found the blood of prophets and of holy men and of all who had been slain on the earth . "
66019001	AFTER this I heard what seemed the loud voices of a great multitude in heaven saying , " Hallelujah ! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God ,
66019002	for true and just are his judgments . He has judged the great prostitute who was corrupting the earth with her lewdness and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants . "
66019003	Again they shouted , " Hallelujah ! Her smoke will ascend for the ages of the ages . "
66019004	Then the twenty-four elders fell down and the four living creatures worshiped God who sits on the throne , saying , " Amen ! Hallelujah ! "
66019005	A voice came from the throne saying , " Praise our God , all of you his servants who reverence him , both small and great . "
66019006	Then I heard what seemed like the voices of a great multitude , like the sound of many waters , like the sound of mighty thunders , saying , " Hallelujah ! For the Lord our God the Almighty is king .
66019007	Let us rejoice and be glad and give glory to him ; for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has prepared herself
66019008	and it has been granted to her to be clothed in fine linen shining and pure . " For the fine linen is the righteous acts of the holy .
66019009	Then he said to me , " Write : Blessed are they who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb ! " He said to me , " These are the true words of God . "
66019010	Then I fell down at his feet and worshiped him . But he said to me , " No , no . I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren who hold the testimony to Jesus . Worship God . For testimony to Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . "
66019011	Then I saw heaven open and there was a white horse , and he who was sitting on it was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he judges and makes war .
66019012	His eyes are a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems . He has a name written which no one but himself knows ,
66019013	and he is clothed in a garment dipped in blood and his name has been called The Word of God .
66019014	The armies that are in heaven follow him on white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean .
66019015	From his mouth issues a sharp sword to smite the nations . He will shepherd them with a rod of iron , and he treads the winepress of the fierce wrath of God Almighty .
66019016	He has on his robe and on his thigh a name written , " King of kings and Lord of lords . "
66019017	Then I saw one angel standing on the sun , and he shouted with a loud voice , saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven , " Come , gather for the great feast of God ,
66019018	to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them , and the flesh of freemen and of slaves , of small and great . "
66019019	Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to do battle with him who sits on the horse and with his army .
66019020	And the Beast was captured and with him the False Prophet who did miracles in his presence and thereby misled those who received the mark of the Beast and who worshiped his image . The two were flung alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone .
66019021	The rest were slain with the sword of him who sits upon the horse , the sword that issued from his mouth , and all the birds were gorged with their flesh .
66020001	THEN I saw an angel descending from heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand .
66020002	He laid hold of the Dragon , the ancient Serpent , who is the Devil and Satan , and chained him for a thousand years
66020003	and flung him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him , so that he should not mislead the nations until the thousand years were ended . After that he must be loosed for a little while .
66020004	Then I saw thrones , and men took their seats on them and the power to judge was granted to them . I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for God's message , and who had not worshiped the Beast nor his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands . They lived and reigned as kings with Christ a thousand years ,
66020005	but the rest of the dead did not return to life until the thousand years were finished . This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection ! Over these the second death has no power , but they will be priests and kings of God and of Christ , and will reign with him the thousand years .
66020007	When the thousand years are ended , Satan will be loosed from his prison
66020008	and will come out to mislead the nations that are at the four corners of the earth — Gog and Magog — and gather them to battle in number like the sand of the sea .
66020009	They went up over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy and the beloved city . But fire fell from heaven and consumed them ,
66020010	and the Devil who was misleading them was flung into the lake of fire and brimstone , where are also the Beast and the False Prophet , and they will be tormented day and night for the ages of the ages .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne and him who was sitting on it , from whose face earth and heaven fled away and no place was found for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne , and books were opened . And another book was opened which is the Book of Life . The dead were judged out of what was written in the books according to their deeds .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead that were in it , and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them , and they were judged each according to his deeds .
66020014	Death and Hades were flung into the lake of fire . This is the second death — the lake of fire .
66020015	If any one was not found written in the Book of Life he was flung into the lake of fire .
66021001	THEN I saw a new heaven and a new earth , for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more .
66021002	I saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying , " The Tent of God is with men . He will tent with them and they will be his people and he will be their God .
66021004	He will wipe every tear from their eyes . Death shall be no more ; neither shall there any longer be sorrow or wailing or painful toil ; for the first things have passed away . "
66021005	He who was sitting on the throne said , " See , I am making all things new . " He said , " Write ; for these words are trustworthy and true . "
66021006	He said to me , " They have come to pass . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end . To him who is thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life freely .
66021007	He who conquers shall inherit all things , and I will be his God and he shall be to me a son .
66021008	But the timid and faithless and abominable and murderers and the unchaste and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars will have their lot in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone , which is the second death . "
66021009	Then one of the angels that had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came and spoke with me . " Come here , " he said , " and I will show you the Bride , the Lamb's wife . "
66021010	Then he carried me in Spirit to the top of a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God ,
66021011	having the glory of God . Her brilliance was like that of a most precious stone , like crystalline jasper .
66021012	She had a wall great and high , and she had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels , and there were names written upon the gates . They are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel .
66021013	On the east were three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates .
66021014	The wall of the city had twelve foundations and upon them were twelve names , the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	He who was speaking with me had a golden reed as a measure , to measure the city and her gates and her wall .
66021016	The city stands foursquare and the length is the same as the breadth . He measured the city with the reed . It extends twelve thousand furlongs . The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
66021017	He measured the wall of it , a hundred and forty-four cubits by human measure , which is also that of an angel .
66021018	The material of the wall of it was jasper and the city was pure gold like clear glass .
66021019	The foundations of the wall of the city were decorated with every kind of precious stone . The first foundation was jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	the fifth sardonyx , the sixth sardius , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	The twelve gates were twelve pearls . Each one of the gates was of one pearl . The street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass .
66021022	I saw no temple in it ; for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb .
66021023	And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it ; for the glory of God illumines it and the Lamb is its light .
66021024	The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it ,
66021025	and its gates will not be closed by day , and there will be no night there .
66021026	They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it .
66021027	But there will not enter into it anything unholy or any one who makes an abomination or a lie , but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life .
66022001	THEN he showed me a river of water of life bright as crystal , issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb .
66022002	In the space between the street and the river , on this side and on that , grew trees of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit , and yielding their fruit every month . The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
66022003	There will no longer be any accursed thing . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him with holy rites .
66022004	They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	There will not be night any more and they will have no need of lamplight or of sunlight ; for the Lord God will shine upon them and they will be kings for the ages of the ages .
66022006	Then he said to me , " These words are trustworthy and true . The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show to his servants what must soon come to pass .
66022007	I am coming soon . Blessed is he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this book . "
66022008	I , John , am he who heard and saw these things . And when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me .
66022009	But he said to me , " No , no . I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren and of the prophets and of those who are keeping the words of this book . Worship God . "
66022010	Then he said to me , " Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book . For the time is near .
66022011	Let the wrongdoer do wrong still , and let him who is filthy be filthy still , and let the righteous do righteousness still , and let the holy be holy still .
66022012	I am coming soon and my reward is with me , to pay each in full as his work is .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
66022014	Blessed will those be who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city .
66022015	Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the unchaste and the murderers and the idolaters and every one who loves and makes a lie .
66022016	" I , Jesus , have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches . I am the Root and the Offspring of David , the bright morning Star . "
66022017	The Spirit and the Bride say , " Come . " Let him who hears say , " Come . " Let him who thirsts come . Let him who will take the water of life freely .
66022018	I testify to every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book , if any one adds to these things , God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book ,
66022019	and if any one takes away anything from the words of the book of this prophecy , God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city , which are written of in this book .
66022020	He who bears this testimony says , " Yes , I am coming soon . " Amen , come , Lord Jesus .
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all !
