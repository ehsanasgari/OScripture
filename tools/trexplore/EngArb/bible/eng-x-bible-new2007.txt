40001001	This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac , Isaac the father of Jacob , Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers ,
40001003	Judah the father of Perez and Zerah ( by Tamar ) , Perez the father of Hezron , Hezron the father of Ram ,
40001004	Ram the father of Amminadab , Amminadab the father of Nahshon , Nahshon the father of Salmon ,
40001005	Salmon the father of Boaz ( by Rahab ) , Boaz the father of Obed ( by Ruth ) , Obed the father of Jesse ,
40001006	and Jesse the father of David the king . David was the father of Solomon ( by the wife of Uriah ) ,
40001007	Solomon the father of Rehoboam , Rehoboam the father of Abijah , Abijah the father of Asa ,
40001008	Asa the father of Jehoshaphat , Jehoshaphat the father of Joram , Joram the father of Uzziah ,
40001009	Uzziah the father of Jotham , Jotham the father of Ahaz , Ahaz the father of Hezekiah ,
40001010	Hezekiah the father of Manasseh , Manasseh the father of Amon , Amon the father of Josiah ,
40001011	and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers , at the time of the deportation to Babylon .
40001012	After the deportation to Babylon , Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel , Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel ,
40001013	Zerubbabel the father of Abiud , Abiud the father of Eliakim , Eliakim the father of Azor ,
40001014	Azor the father of Zadok , Zadok the father of Achim , Achim the father of Eliud ,
40001015	Eliud the father of Eleazar , Eleazar the father of Matthan , Matthan the father of Jacob ,
40001016	and Jacob the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , by whom Jesus was born , who is called Christ .
40001017	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations , and from David to the deportation to Babylon , fourteen generations , and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ , fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way . While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph , but before they came together , she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Because Joseph , her husband to be , was a righteous man , and because he did not want to disgrace her , he intended to divorce her privately .
40001020	When he had contemplated this , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife , because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus , because he will save his people from their sins . ”
40001022	This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled :
40001023	“ Look ! The virgin will conceive and bear a son , and they will call him Emmanuel , ” which means “ God with us . ”
40001024	When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him . He took his wife ,
40001025	but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son , whom he named Jesus .
40002001	After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea , in the time of King Herod , wise men from the East came to Jerusalem
40002002	saying , “ Where is the one who is born king of the Jews ? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him . ”
40002003	When King Herod heard this he was alarmed , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law , he asked them where the Christ was to be born .
40002005	“ In Bethlehem of Judea , ” they said , “ for it is written this way by the prophet :
40002006	‘ And you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , are in no way least among the rulers of Judah , for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel . ’ ”
40002007	Then Herod privately summoned the wise men and determined from them when the star had appeared .
40002008	He sent them to Bethlehem and said , “ Go and look carefully for the child . When you find him , inform me so that I can go and worship him as well . ”
40002009	After listening to the king they left , and once again the star they saw when it rose led them until it stopped above the place where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star they shouted joyfully .
40002011	As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother , they bowed down and worshiped him . They opened their treasure boxes and gave him gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
40002012	After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod , they went back by another route to their own country .
40002013	After they had gone , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up , take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt , and stay there until I tell you , for Herod is going to look for the child to kill him . ”
40002014	Then he got up , took the child and his mother during the night , and went to Egypt .
40002015	He stayed there until Herod died . In this way what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled : “ I called my Son out of Egypt . ”
40002016	When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men , he became enraged . He sent men to kill all the children in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding region from the age of two and under , according to the time he had learned from the wise men .
40002017	Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled :
40002018	“ A voice was heard in Ramah , weeping and loud wailing , Rachel weeping for her children , and she did not want to be comforted , because they were gone . ”
40002019	After Herod had died , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40002020	saying , “ Get up , take the child and his mother , and go to the land of Israel , for those who were seeking the child’s life are dead . ”
40002021	So he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . After being warned in a dream , he went to the regions of Galilee .
40002023	He came to a town called Nazareth and lived there . Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled , that Jesus would be called a Nazarene .
40003001	In those days John the Baptist came into the wilderness of Judea proclaiming ,
40003002	“ Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is near . ”
40003003	For he is the one about whom Isaiah the prophet had spoken : “ The voice of one shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord , make his paths straight . ’ ”
40003004	Now John wore clothing made from camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist , and his diet consisted of locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then people from Jerusalem , as well as all Judea and all the region around the Jordan , were going out to him ,
40003006	and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins .
40003007	But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said to them , “ You offspring of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
40003008	Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance ,
40003009	and don’t think you can say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones !
40003010	Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees , and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .
40003011	“ I baptize you with water , for repentance , but the one coming after me is more powerful than I am – I am not worthy to carry his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
40003012	His winnowing fork is in his hand , and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse , but the chaff he will burn up with inextinguishable fire . ”
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to John to be baptized by him in the Jordan River .
40003014	But John tried to prevent him , saying , “ I need to be baptized by you , and yet you come to me ? ”
40003015	So Jesus replied to him , “ Let it happen now , for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness . ” Then John yielded to him .
40003016	After Jesus was baptized , just as he was coming up out of the water , the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him .
40003017	And a voice from heaven said , “ This is my one dear Son ; in him I take great delight . ”
40004001	Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	After he fasted forty days and forty nights he was famished .
40004003	The tempter came and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , command these stones to become bread . ”
40004004	But he answered , “ It is written , ‘ Man does not live by bread alone , but by every word that comes from the mouth of God . ’ ”
40004005	Then the devil took him to the holy city , had him stand on the highest point of the temple ,
40004006	and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down . For it is written , ‘ He will command his angels concerning you ’ and ‘ with their hands they will lift you up , so that you will not strike your foot against a stone . ’ ”
40004007	Jesus said to him , “ Once again it is written : ‘ You are not to put the Lord your God to the test . ’ ”
40004008	Again , the devil took him to a very high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their grandeur .
40004009	And he said to him , “ I will give you all these things if you throw yourself to the ground and worship me . ”
40004010	Then Jesus said to him , “ Go away , Satan ! For it is written : ‘ You are to worship the Lord your God and serve only him . ’ ”
40004011	Then the devil left him , and angels came and began ministering to his needs .
40004012	Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned , he went into Galilee .
40004013	While in Galilee , he moved from Nazareth to make his home in Capernaum by the sea , in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali ,
40004014	so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled :
40004015	“ Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , the way by the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles –
40004016	the people who sit in darkness have seen a great light , and on those who sit in the region and shadow of death a light has dawned . ”
40004017	From that time Jesus began to preach this message : “ Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is near . ”
40004018	As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers , Simon ( called Peter ) and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ( for they were fishermen ) .
40004019	He said to them , “ Follow me , and I will turn you into fishers of people . ”
40004020	They left their nets immediately and followed him .
40004021	Going on from there he saw two other brothers , James the son of Zebedee and John his brother , in a boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets . Then he called them .
40004022	They immediately left the boat and their father and followed him .
40004023	Jesus went throughout all of Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all kinds of disease and sickness among the people .
40004024	So a report about him spread throughout Syria . People brought to him all who suffered with various illnesses and afflictions , those who had seizures , paralytics , and those possessed by demons , and he healed them .
40004025	And large crowds followed him from Galilee , the Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea , and beyond the Jordan River .
40005001	When he saw the crowds , he went up the mountain . After he sat down his disciples came to him .
40005002	Then he began to teach them by saying :
40005003	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them .
40005004	“ Blessed are those who mourn , for they will be comforted .
40005005	“ Blessed are the meek , for they will inherit the earth .
40005006	“ Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness , for they will be satisfied .
40005007	“ Blessed are the merciful , for they will be shown mercy .
40005008	“ Blessed are the pure in heart , for they will see God .
40005009	“ Blessed are the peacemakers , for they will be called the children of God .
40005010	“ Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them .
40005011	“ Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things about you falsely on account of me .
40005012	Rejoice and be glad because your reward is great in heaven , for they persecuted the prophets before you in the same way .
40005013	“ You are the salt of the earth . But if salt loses its flavor , how can it be made salty again ? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled on by people .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A city located on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand , and it gives light to all in the house .
40005016	In the same way , let your light shine before people , so that they can see your good deeds and give honor to your Father in heaven .
40005017	“ Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets . I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them .
40005018	I tell you the truth , until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter will pass from the law until everything takes place .
40005019	So anyone who breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven , but whoever obeys them and teaches others to do so will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I tell you , unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law and the Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	“ You have heard that it was said to an older generation , ‘ Do not murder , ’ and ‘ whoever murders will be subjected to judgment . ’
40005022	But I say to you that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subjected to judgment . And whoever insults a brother will be brought before the council , and whoever says ‘ Fool ’ will be sent to fiery hell .
40005023	So then , if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there in front of the altar . First go and be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your gift .
40005025	Reach agreement quickly with your accuser while on the way to court , or he may hand you over to the judge , and the judge hand you over to the warden , and you will be thrown into prison .
40005026	I tell you the truth , you will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny !
40005027	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ Do not commit adultery . ’
40005028	But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye causes you to sin , tear it out and throw it away ! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell .
40005030	If your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away ! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell .
40005031	“ It was said , ‘ Whoever divorces his wife must give her a legal document . ’
40005032	But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife , except for immorality , makes her commit adultery , and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40005033	“ Again , you have heard that it was said to an older generation , ‘ Do not break an oath , but fulfill your vows to the Lord . ’
40005034	But I say to you , do not take oaths at all – not by heaven , because it is the throne of God ,
40005035	not by earth , because it is his footstool , and not by Jerusalem , because it is the city of the great King .
40005036	Do not take an oath by your head , because you are not able to make one hair white or black .
40005037	Let your word be ‘ Yes , yes ’ or ‘ No , no . ’ More than this is from the evil one .
40005038	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . ’
40005039	But I say to you , do not resist the evildoer . But whoever strikes you on the right cheek , turn the other to him as well .
40005040	And if someone wants to sue you and to take your tunic , give him your coat also .
40005041	And if anyone forces you to go one mile , go with him two .
40005042	Give to the one who asks you , and do not reject the one who wants to borrow from you .
40005043	“ You have heard that it was said , ‘ Love your neighbor ’ and ‘ hate your enemy . ’
40005044	But I say to you , love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	so that you may be like your Father in heaven , since he causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward do you have ? Even the tax collectors do the same , don’t they ?
40005047	And if you only greet your brothers , what more do you do ? Even the Gentiles do the same , don’t they ?
40005048	So then , be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect .
40006001	“ Be careful not to display your righteousness merely to be seen by people . Otherwise you have no reward with your Father in heaven .
40006002	Thus whenever you do charitable giving , do not blow a trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in synagogues and on streets so that people will praise them . I tell you the truth , they have their reward .
40006003	But when you do your giving , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your gift may be in secret . And your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006005	“ Whenever you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street corners so that people can see them . Truly I say to you , they have their reward .
40006006	But whenever you pray , go into your room , close the door , and pray to your Father in secret . And your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006007	When you pray , do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles , because they think that by their many words they will be heard .
40006008	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
40006009	So pray this way : Our Father in heaven , may your name be honored ,
40006010	may your kingdom come , may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	Give us today our daily bread ,
40006012	and forgive us our debts , as we ourselves have forgiven our debtors .
40006013	And do not lead us into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one .
40006014	“ For if you forgive others their sins , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive others , your Father will not forgive you your sins .
40006016	“ When you fast , do not look sullen like the hypocrites , for they make their faces unattractive so that people will see them fasting . I tell you the truth , they have their reward .
40006017	When you fast , put oil on your head and wash your face ,
40006018	so that it will not be obvious to others when you are fasting , but only to your Father who is in secret . And your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
40006019	“ Do not accumulate for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal .
40006020	But accumulate for yourselves treasures in heaven , where moth and rust do not destroy , and thieves do not break in and steal .
40006021	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
40006022	“ The eye is the lamp of the body . If then your eye is healthy , your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eye is diseased , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the light in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
40006024	“ No one can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and money .
40006025	“ Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat or drink , or about your body , what you will wear . Isn’t there more to life than food and more to the body than clothing ?
40006026	Look at the birds in the sky : They do not sow , or reap , or gather into barns , yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Aren’t you more valuable than they are ?
40006027	And which of you by worrying can add even one hour to his life ?
40006028	Why do you worry about clothing ? Think about how the flowers of the field grow ; they do not work or spin .
40006029	Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these !
40006030	And if this is how God clothes the wild grass , which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven , won’t he clothe you even more , you people of little faith ?
40006031	So then , don’t worry saying , ‘ What will we eat ? ’ or ‘ What will we drink ? ’ or ‘ What will we wear ? ’
40006032	For the unconverted pursue these things , and your heavenly Father knows that you need them .
40006033	But above all pursue his kingdom and righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well .
40006034	So then , do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will worry about itself . Today has enough trouble of its own .
40007001	“ Do not judge so that you will not be judged .
40007002	For by the standard you judge you will be judged , and the measure you use will be the measure you receive .
40007003	Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye , but fail to see the beam of wood in your own ?
40007004	Or how can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me remove the speck from your eye , ’ while there is a beam in your own ?
40007005	You hypocrite ! First remove the beam from your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye .
40007006	Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs ; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and turn around and tear you to pieces .
40007007	“ Ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be opened for you .
40007008	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks , the door will be opened .
40007009	Is there anyone among you who , if his son asks for bread , will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a snake ?
40007011	If you then , although you are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him !
40007012	In everything , treat others as you would want them to treat you , for this fulfills the law and the prophets .
40007013	“ Enter through the narrow gate , because the gate is wide and the way is spacious that leads to destruction , and there are many who enter through it .
40007014	But the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life , and there are few who find it .
40007015	“ Watch out for false prophets , who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves .
40007016	You will recognize them by their fruit . Grapes are not gathered from thorns or figs from thistles , are they ?
40007017	In the same way , every good tree bears good fruit , but the bad tree bears bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit , nor a bad tree to bear good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	So then , you will recognize them by their fruit .
40007021	“ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven – only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven .
40007022	On that day , many will say to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , didn’t we prophesy in your name , and in your name cast out demons and do many powerful deeds ? ’
40007023	Then I will declare to them , ‘ I never knew you . Go away from me , you lawbreakers ! ’
40007024	“ Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on rock .
40007025	The rain fell , the flood came , and the winds beat against that house , but it did not collapse because it had been founded on rock .
40007026	Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand .
40007027	The rain fell , the flood came , and the winds beat against that house , and it collapsed ; it was utterly destroyed ! ”
40007028	When Jesus finished saying these things , the crowds were amazed by his teaching ,
40007029	because he taught them like one who had authority , not like their experts in the law .
40008001	After he came down from the mountain , large crowds followed him .
40008002	And a leper approached , and bowed low before him , saying , “ Lord , if you are willing , you can make me clean . ”
40008003	He stretched out his hand and touched him saying , “ I am willing . Be clean ! ” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
40008004	Then Jesus said to him , “ See that you do not speak to anyone , but go , show yourself to a priest , and bring the offering that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
40008005	When he entered Capernaum , a centurion came to him asking for help :
40008006	“ Lord , my servant is lying at home paralyzed , in terrible anguish . ”
40008007	Jesus said to him , “ I will come and heal him . ”
40008008	But the centurion replied , “ Lord , I am not worthy to have you come under my roof . Instead , just say the word and my servant will be healed .
40008009	For I too am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to this one , ‘ Go ’ and he goes , and to another ‘ Come ’ and he comes , and to my slave ‘ Do this ’ and he does it . ”
40008010	When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him , “ I tell you the truth , I have not found such faith in anyone in Israel !
40008011	I tell you , many will come from the east and west to share the banquet with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven ,
40008012	but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ”
40008013	Then Jesus said to the centurion , “ Go ; just as you believed , it will be done for you . ” And the servant was healed at that hour .
40008014	Now when Jesus entered Peter’s house , he saw his mother-in-law lying down , sick with a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand , and the fever left her . Then she got up and began to serve them .
40008016	When it was evening , many demon-possessed people were brought to him . He drove out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick .
40008017	In this way what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled : “ He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases . ”
40008018	Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him , he gave orders to go to the other side of the lake .
40008019	Then an expert in the law came to him and said , “ Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go . ”
40008020	Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have dens , and the birds in the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . ”
40008021	Another of the disciples said to him , “ Lord , let me first go and bury my father . ”
40008022	But Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead . ”
40008023	As he got into the boat , his disciples followed him .
40008024	And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat . But he was asleep .
40008025	So they came and woke him up saying , “ Lord , save us ! We are about to die ! ”
40008026	But he said to them , “ Why are you cowardly , you people of little faith ? ” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and it was dead calm .
40008027	And the men were amazed and said , “ What sort of person is this ? Even the winds and the sea obey him ! ”
40008028	When he came to the other side , to the region of the Gadarenes , two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him . They were extremely violent , so that no one was able to pass by that way .
40008029	They cried out , “ Son of God , leave us alone ! Have you come here to torment us before the time ? ”
40008030	A large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them .
40008031	Then the demons begged him , “ If you drive us out , send us into the herd of pigs . ”
40008032	And he said , “ Go ! ” So they came out and went into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water .
40008033	The herdsmen ran off , went into the town , and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men .
40008034	Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus . And when they saw him , they begged him to leave their region .
40009001	After getting into a boat he crossed to the other side and came to his own town .
40009002	Just then some people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher . When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Have courage , son ! Your sins are forgiven . ”
40009003	Then some of the experts in the law said to themselves , “ This man is blaspheming ! ”
40009004	When Jesus saw their reaction he said , “ Why do you respond with evil in your hearts ?
40009005	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ or to say , ‘ Stand up and walk ’ ?
40009006	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” – then he said to the paralytic – “ Stand up , take your stretcher , and go home . ”
40009007	And he stood up and went home .
40009008	When the crowd saw this , they were afraid and honored God who had given such authority to men .
40009009	As Jesus went on from there , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth . “ Follow me , ” he said to him . And he got up and followed him .
40009010	As Jesus was having a meal in Matthew’s house , many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	When the Pharisees saw this they said to his disciples , “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
40009012	When Jesus heard this he said , “ Those who are healthy don’t need a physician , but those who are sick do .
40009013	Go and learn what this saying means : ‘ I want mercy and not sacrifice . ’ For I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners . ”
40009014	Then John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples don’t fast ? ”
40009015	Jesus said to them , “ The wedding guests cannot mourn while the bridegroom is with them , can they ? But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , because the patch will pull away from the garment and the tear will be worse .
40009017	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise the skins burst and the wine is spilled out and the skins are destroyed . Instead they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved . ”
40009018	As he was saying these things , a ruler came , bowed low before him , and said , “ My daughter has just died , but come and lay your hand on her and she will live . ”
40009019	Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him .
40009020	But a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak .
40009021	For she kept saying to herself , “ If only I touch his cloak , I will be healed . ”
40009022	But when Jesus turned and saw her he said , “ Have courage , daughter ! Your faith has made you well . ” And the woman was healed from that hour .
40009023	When Jesus entered the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd ,
40009024	he said , “ Go away , for the girl is not dead but asleep . ” And they began making fun of him .
40009025	But when the crowd had been put outside , he went in and gently took her by the hand , and the girl got up .
40009026	And the news of this spread throughout that region .
40009027	As Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed him , shouting , “ Have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
40009028	When he went into the house , the blind men came to him . Jesus said to them , “ Do you believe that I am able to do this ? ” They said to him , “ Yes , Lord . ”
40009029	Then he touched their eyes saying , “ Let it be done for you according to your faith . ”
40009030	And their eyes were opened . Then Jesus sternly warned them , “ See that no one knows about this . ”
40009031	But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that entire region .
40009032	As they were going away , a man who could not talk and was demon-possessed was brought to him .
40009033	After the demon was cast out , the man who had been mute spoke . The crowds were amazed and said , “ Never has anything like this been seen in Israel ! ”
40009034	But the Pharisees said , “ By the ruler of demons he casts out demons . ”
40009035	Then Jesus went throughout all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues , preaching the good news of the kingdom , and healing every kind of disease and sickness .
40009036	When he saw the crowds , he had compassion on them because they were bewildered and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , “ The harvest is plentiful , but the workers are few .
40009038	Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest . ”
40010001	Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits so they could cast them out and heal every kind of disease and sickness .
40010002	Now these are the names of the twelve apostles : first , Simon ( called Peter ) , and Andrew his brother ; James son of Zebedee and John his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
40010005	Jesus sent out these twelve , instructing them as follows : “ Do not go to Gentile regions and do not enter any Samaritan town .
40010006	Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	As you go , preach this message : ‘ The kingdom of heaven is near ! ’
40010008	Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse lepers , cast out demons . Freely you received , freely give .
40010009	Do not take gold , silver , or copper in your belts ,
40010010	no bag for the journey , or an extra tunic , or sandals or staff , for the worker deserves his provisions .
40010011	Whenever you enter a town or village , find out who is worthy there and stay with them until you leave .
40010012	As you enter the house , give it greetings .
40010013	And if the house is worthy , let your peace come on it , but if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you .
40010014	And if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message , shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or that town .
40010015	I tell you the truth , it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town !
40010016	“ I am sending you out like sheep surrounded by wolves , so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves .
40010017	Beware of people , because they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues .
40010018	And you will be brought before governors and kings because of me , as a witness to them and the Gentiles .
40010019	Whenever they hand you over for trial , do not worry about how to speak or what to say , for what you should say will be given to you at that time .
40010020	For it is not you speaking , but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	“ Brother will hand over brother to death , and a father his child . Children will rise against parents and have them put to death .
40010022	And you will be hated by everyone because of my name . But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
40010023	Whenever they persecute you in one place , flee to another . I tell you the truth , you will not finish going through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	“ A disciple is not greater than his teacher , nor a slave greater than his master .
40010025	It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher , and the slave like his master . If they have called the head of the house ‘ Beelzebul , ’ how much more will they defame the members of his household !
40010026	“ Do not be afraid of them , for nothing is hidden that will not be revealed , and nothing is secret that will not be made known .
40010027	What I say to you in the dark , tell in the light , and what is whispered in your ear , proclaim from the housetops .
40010028	Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . Instead , fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
40010029	Aren’t two sparrows sold for a penny ? Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will .
40010030	Even all the hairs on your head are numbered .
40010031	So do not be afraid ; you are more valuable than many sparrows .
40010032	“ Whoever , then , acknowledges me before people , I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven .
40010033	But whoever denies me before people , I will deny him also before my Father in heaven .
40010034	“ Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth . I have not come to bring peace but a sword .
40010035	For I have come to set a man against his father , a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ,
40010036	and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household .
40010037	“ Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me , and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
40010038	And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me .
40010039	Whoever finds his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life because of me will find it .
40010040	“ Whoever receives you receives me , and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me .
40010041	Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward . Whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward .
40010042	And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple , I tell you the truth , he will never lose his reward . ”
40011001	When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples , he went on from there to teach and preach in their towns .
40011002	Now when John heard in prison about the deeds Christ had done , he sent his disciples to ask a question :
40011003	“ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? ”
40011004	Jesus answered them , “ Go tell John what you hear and see :
40011005	The blind see , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , and the poor have good news proclaimed to them .
40011006	Blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me . ”
40011007	While they were going away , Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
40011008	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fancy clothes ? Look , those who wear fancy clothes are in the homes of kings !
40011009	What did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	This is the one about whom it is written : ‘ Look , I am sending my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way before you . ’
40011011	“ I tell you the truth , among those born of women , no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist . Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is .
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence , and forceful people lay hold of it .
40011013	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John appeared .
40011014	And if you are willing to accept it , he is Elijah , who is to come .
40011015	The one who has ears had better listen !
40011016	“ To what should I compare this generation ? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another ,
40011017	‘ We played the flute for you , yet you did not dance ; we wailed in mourning , yet you did not weep . ’
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look at him , a glutton and a drunk , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds . ”
40011020	Then Jesus began to criticize openly the cities in which he had done many of his miracles , because they did not repent .
40011021	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	But I tell you , it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you !
40011023	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? No , you will be thrown down to Hades ! For if the miracles done among you had been done in Sodom , it would have continued to this day .
40011024	But I tell you , it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you ! ”
40011025	At that time Jesus said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent , and revealed them to little children .
40011026	Yes , Father , for this was your gracious will .
40011027	All things have been handed over to me by my Father . No one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him .
40011028	Come to me , all you who are weary and burdened , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke on you and learn from me , because I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
40011030	For my yoke is easy to bear , and my load is not hard to carry . ”
40012001	At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on a Sabbath . His disciples were hungry , and they began to pick heads of wheat and eat them .
40012002	But when the Pharisees saw this they said to him , “ Look , your disciples are doing what is against the law to do on the Sabbath . ”
40012003	He said to them , “ Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry –
40012004	how he entered the house of God and they ate the sacred bread , which was against the law for him or his companions to eat , but only for the priests ?
40012005	Or have you not read in the law that the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are not guilty ?
40012006	I tell you that something greater than the temple is here .
40012007	If you had known what this means : ‘ I want mercy and not sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned the innocent .
40012008	For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . ”
40012009	Then Jesus left that place and entered their synagogue .
40012010	A man was there who had a withered hand . And they asked Jesus , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ” so that they could accuse him .
40012011	He said to them , “ Would not any one of you , if he had one sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath , take hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	How much more valuable is a person than a sheep ! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath . ”
40012013	Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He stretched it out and it was restored , as healthy as the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him , as to how they could assassinate him .
40012015	Now when Jesus learned of this , he went away from there . Great crowds followed him , and he healed them all .
40012016	But he sternly warned them not to make him known .
40012017	This fulfilled what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet :
40012018	“ Here is my servant whom I have chosen , the one I love , in whom I take great delight . I will put my Spirit on him , and he will proclaim justice to the nations .
40012019	He will not quarrel or cry out , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets .
40012020	He will not break a bruised reed or extinguish a smoldering wick , until he brings justice to victory .
40012021	And in his name the Gentiles will hope . ”
40012022	Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute . Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see .
40012023	All the crowds were amazed and said , “ Could this one be the Son of David ? ”
40012024	But when the Pharisees heard this they said , “ He does not cast out demons except by the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons ! ”
40012025	Now when Jesus realized what they were thinking , he said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed , and no town or house divided against itself will stand .
40012026	So if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
40012027	And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons cast them out ? For this reason they will be your judges .
40012028	But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God has already overtaken you .
40012029	How else can someone enter a strong man’s house and steal his property , unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then he can thoroughly plunder the house .
40012030	Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
40012031	For this reason I tell you , people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven . But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , either in this age or in the age to come .
40012033	“ Make a tree good and its fruit will be good , or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad , for a tree is known by its fruit .
40012034	Offspring of vipers ! How are you able to say anything good , since you are evil ? For the mouth speaks from what fills the heart .
40012035	The good person brings good things out of his good treasury , and the evil person brings evil things out of his evil treasury .
40012036	I tell you that on the day of judgment , people will give an account for every worthless word they speak .
40012037	For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned . ”
40012038	Then some of the experts in the law along with some Pharisees answered him , “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from you . ”
40012039	But he answered them , “ An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights , so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights .
40012041	The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they repented when Jonah preached to them – and now , something greater than Jonah is here !
40012042	The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon – and now , something greater than Solomon is here !
40012043	“ When an unclean spirit goes out of a person , it passes through waterless places looking for rest but does not find it .
40012044	Then it says , ‘ I will return to the home I left . ’ When it returns , it finds the house empty , swept clean , and put in order .
40012045	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and live there , so the last state of that person is worse than the first . It will be that way for this evil generation as well ! ”
40012046	While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds , his mother and brothers came and stood outside , asking to speak to him .
40012047	Someone told him , “ Look , your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you . ”
40012048	To the one who had said this , Jesus replied , “ Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? ”
40012049	And pointing toward his disciples he said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers !
40012050	For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother . ”
40013001	On that day after Jesus went out of the house , he sat by the lake .
40013002	And such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat to sit while the whole crowd stood on the shore .
40013003	He told them many things in parables , saying : “ Listen ! A sower went out to sow .
40013004	And as he sowed , some seeds fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured them .
40013005	Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil . They sprang up quickly because the soil was not deep .
40013006	But when the sun came up , they were scorched , and because they did not have sufficient root , they withered .
40013007	Other seeds fell among the thorns , and they grew up and choked them .
40013008	But other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain , some a hundred times as much , some sixty , and some thirty .
40013009	The one who has ears had better listen ! ”
40013010	Then the disciples came to him and said , “ Why do you speak to them in parables ? ”
40013011	He replied , “ You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but they have not .
40013012	For whoever has will be given more , and will have an abundance . But whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken from him .
40013013	For this reason I speak to them in parables : Although they see they do not see , and although they hear they do not hear nor do they understand .
40013014	And concerning them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says : ‘ You will listen carefully yet will never understand , you will look closely yet will never comprehend .
40013015	For the heart of this people has become dull ; they are hard of hearing , and they have shut their eyes , so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn , and I would heal them . ’
40013016	“ But your eyes are blessed because they see , and your ears because they hear .
40013017	For I tell you the truth , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it , and to hear what you hear but did not hear it .
40013018	“ So listen to the parable of the sower :
40013019	When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it , the evil one comes and snatches what was sown in his heart ; this is the seed sown along the path .
40013020	The seed sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy .
40013021	But he has no root in himself and does not endure ; when trouble or persecution comes because of the word , immediately he falls away .
40013022	The seed sown among thorns is the person who hears the word , but worldly cares and the seductiveness of wealth choke the word , so it produces nothing .
40013023	But as for the seed sown on good soil , this is the person who hears the word and understands . He bears fruit , yielding a hundred , sixty , or thirty times what was sown . ”
40013024	He presented them with another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a person who sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	But while everyone was sleeping , an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away .
40013026	When the plants sprouted and bore grain , then the weeds also appeared .
40013027	So the slaves of the owner came and said to him , ‘ Sir , didn’t you sow good seed in your field ? Then where did the weeds come from ? ’
40013028	He said , ‘ An enemy has done this . ’ So the slaves replied , ‘ Do you want us to go and gather them ? ’
40013029	But he said , ‘ No , since in gathering the weeds you may uproot the wheat with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest . At harvest time I will tell the reapers , “ First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned , but then gather the wheat into my barn . ” ’ ”
40013031	He gave them another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field .
40013032	It is the smallest of all the seeds , but when it has grown it is the greatest garden plant and becomes a tree , so that the wild birds come and nest in its branches . ”
40013033	He told them another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen . ”
40013034	Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds ; he did not speak to them without a parable .
40013035	This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet : “ I will open my mouth in parables , I will announce what has been hidden from the foundation of the world . ”
40013036	Then he left the crowds and went into the house . And his disciples came to him saying , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field . ”
40013037	He answered , “ The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man .
40013038	The field is the world and the good seed are the people of the kingdom . The weeds are the people of the evil one ,
40013039	and the enemy who sows them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .
40013040	As the weeds are collected and burned with fire , so it will be at the end of the age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send his angels , and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes sin as well as all lawbreakers .
40013042	They will throw them into the fiery furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . The one who has ears had better listen !
40013044	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure , hidden in a field , that a person found and hid . Then because of joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field .
40013045	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls .
40013046	When he found a pearl of great value , he went out and sold everything he had and bought it .
40013047	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea that caught all kinds of fish .
40013048	When it was full , they pulled it ashore , sat down , and put the good fish into containers and threw the bad away .
40013049	It will be this way at the end of the age . Angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous
40013050	and throw them into the fiery furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013051	“ Have you understood all these things ? ” They replied , “ Yes . ”
40013052	Then he said to them , “ Therefore every expert in the law who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and old . ”
40013053	Now when Jesus finished these parables , he moved on from there .
40013054	Then he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue . They were astonished and said , “ Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers ?
40013055	Isn’t this the carpenter’s son ? Isn’t his mother named Mary ? And aren’t his brothers James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas ?
40013056	And aren’t all his sisters here with us ? Where did he get all this ? ”
40013057	And so they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house . ”
40013058	And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief .
40014001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus ,
40014002	and he said to his servants , “ This is John the Baptist . He has been raised from the dead ! And because of this , miraculous powers are at work in him . ”
40014003	For Herod had arrested John , bound him , and put him in prison on account of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife ,
40014004	because John had repeatedly told him , “ It is not lawful for you to have her . ”
40014005	Although Herod wanted to kill John , he feared the crowd because they accepted John as a prophet .
40014006	But on Herod’s birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod ,
40014007	so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
40014008	Instructed by her mother , she said , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter . ”
40014009	Although it grieved the king , because of his oath and the dinner guests he commanded it to be given .
40014010	So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison .
40014011	His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	Then John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it and went and told Jesus .
40014013	Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to an isolated place . But when the crowd heard about it , they followed him on foot from the towns .
40014014	As he got out he saw the large crowd , and he had compassion on them and healed their sick .
40014015	When evening arrived , his disciples came to him saying , “ This is an isolated place and the hour is already late . Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves . ”
40014016	But he replied , “ They don’t need to go . You give them something to eat . ”
40014017	They said to him , “ We have here only five loaves and two fish . ”
40014018	“ Bring them here to me , ” he replied .
40014019	Then he instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass . He took the five loaves and two fish , and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves . He gave them to the disciples , who in turn gave them to the crowds .
40014020	They all ate and were satisfied , and they picked up the broken pieces left over , twelve baskets full .
40014021	Not counting women and children , there were about five thousand men who ate .
40014022	Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side , while he dispersed the crowds .
40014023	And after he sent the crowds away , he went up the mountain by himself to pray . When evening came , he was there alone .
40014024	Meanwhile the boat , already far from land , was taking a beating from the waves because the wind was against it .
40014025	As the night was ending , Jesus came to them walking on the sea .
40014026	When the disciples saw him walking on the water they were terrified and said , “ It’s a ghost ! ” and cried out with fear .
40014027	But immediately Jesus spoke to them : “ Have courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
40014028	Peter said to him , “ Lord , if it is you , order me to come to you on the water . ”
40014029	So he said , “ Come . ” Peter got out of the boat , walked on the water , and came toward Jesus .
40014030	But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid . And starting to sink , he cried out , “ Lord , save me ! ”
40014031	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him , saying to him , “ You of little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
40014032	When they went up into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	Then those who were in the boat worshiped him , saying , “ Truly you are the Son of God . ”
40014034	After they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret .
40014035	When the people there recognized him , they sent word into all the surrounding area , and they brought all their sick to him .
40014036	They begged him if they could only touch the edge of his cloak , and all who touched it were healed .
40015001	Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said ,
40015002	“ Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders ? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat . ”
40015003	He answered them , “ And why do you disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition ?
40015004	For God said , ‘ Honor your father and mother ’ and ‘ Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death . ’
40015005	But you say , ‘ If someone tells his father or mother , “ Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God , ”
40015006	he does not need to honor his father . ’ You have nullified the word of God on account of your tradition .
40015007	Hypocrites ! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said ,
40015008	‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me ,
40015009	and they worship me in vain , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men . ’ ”
40015010	Then he called the crowd to him and said , “ Listen and understand .
40015011	What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth ; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person . ”
40015012	Then the disciples came to him and said , “ Do you know that when the Pharisees heard this saying they were offended ? ”
40015013	And he replied , “ Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted .
40015014	Leave them ! They are blind guides . If someone who is blind leads another who is blind , both will fall into a pit . ”
40015015	But Peter said to him , “ Explain this parable to us . ”
40015016	Jesus said , “ Even after all this , are you still so foolish ?
40015017	Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer ?
40015018	But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart , and these things defile a person .
40015019	For out of the heart come evil ideas , murder , adultery , sexual immorality , theft , false testimony , slander .
40015020	These are the things that defile a person ; it is not eating with unwashed hands that defiles a person . ”
40015021	After going out from there , Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out , “ Have mercy on me , Lord , Son of David ! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed ! ”
40015023	But he did not answer her a word . Then his disciples came and begged him , “ Send her away , because she keeps on crying out after us . ”
40015024	So he answered , “ I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . ”
40015025	But she came and bowed down before him and said , “ Lord , help me ! ”
40015026	“ It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs , ” he said .
40015027	“ Yes , Lord , ” she replied , “ but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table . ”
40015028	Then Jesus answered her , “ Woman , your faith is great ! Let what you want be done for you . ” And her daughter was healed from that hour .
40015029	When he left there , Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee . Then he went up a mountain , where he sat down .
40015030	Then large crowds came to him bringing with them the lame , blind , crippled , mute , and many others . They laid them at his feet , and he healed them .
40015031	As a result , the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking , the crippled healthy , the lame walking , and the blind seeing , and they praised the God of Israel .
40015032	Then Jesus called the disciples and said , “ I have compassion on the crowd , because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat . I don’t want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way . ”
40015033	The disciples said to him , “ Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd ? ”
40015034	Jesus said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” They replied , “ Seven – and a few small fish . ”
40015035	After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground ,
40015036	he took the seven loaves and the fish , and after giving thanks , he broke them and began giving them to the disciples , who then gave them to the crowds .
40015037	They all ate and were satisfied , and they picked up the broken pieces left over , seven baskets full .
40015038	Not counting children and women , there were four thousand men who ate .
40015039	After sending away the crowd , he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan .
40016001	Now when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus , they asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	He said , “ When evening comes you say , ‘ It will be fair weather , because the sky is red , ’
40016003	and in the morning , ‘ It will be stormy today , because the sky is red and darkening . ’ You know how to judge correctly the appearance of the sky , but you cannot evaluate the signs of the times .
40016004	A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah . ” Then he left them and went away .
40016005	When the disciples went to the other side , they forgot to take bread .
40016006	“ Watch out , ” Jesus said to them , “ beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40016007	So they began to discuss this among themselves , saying , “ It is because we brought no bread . ”
40016008	When Jesus learned of this , he said , “ You who have such little faith ! Why are you arguing among yourselves about having no bread ?
40016009	Do you still not understand ? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many baskets you took up ?
40016010	Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up ?
40016011	How could you not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread ? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees ! ”
40016012	Then they understood that he had not told them to be on guard against the yeast in bread , but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
40016014	They answered , “ Some say John the Baptist , others Elijah , and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets . ”
40016015	He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ”
40016016	Simon Peter answered , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God . ”
40016017	And Jesus answered him , “ You are blessed , Simon son of Jonah , because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you , but my Father in heaven !
40016018	And I tell you that you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my church , and the gates of Hades will not overpower it .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . Whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven , and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . ”
40016020	Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders , chief priests , and experts in the law , and be killed , and on the third day be raised .
40016022	So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him : “ God forbid , Lord ! This must not happen to you ! ”
40016023	But he turned and said to Peter , “ Get behind me , Satan ! You are a stumbling block to me , because you are not setting your mind on God’s interests , but on man’s . ”
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ If anyone wants to become my follower , he must deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
40016025	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it .
40016026	For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life ? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life ?
40016027	For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father , and then he will reward each person according to what he has done .
40016028	I tell you the truth , there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . ”
40017001	Six days later Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John the brother of James , and led them privately up a high mountain .
40017002	And he was transfigured before them . His face shone like the sun , and his clothes became white as light .
40017003	Then Moses and Elijah also appeared before them , talking with him .
40017004	So Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you want , I will make three shelters – one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40017005	While he was still speaking , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my one dear Son , in whom I take great delight . Listen to him ! ”
40017006	When the disciples heard this , they were overwhelmed with fear and threw themselves down with their faces to the ground .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them . “ Get up , ” he said . “ Do not be afraid . ”
40017008	When they looked up , all they saw was Jesus alone .
40017009	As they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , “ Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead . ”
40017010	The disciples asked him , “ Why then do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first ? ”
40017011	He answered , “ Elijah does indeed come first and will restore all things .
40017012	And I tell you that Elijah has already come . Yet they did not recognize him , but did to him whatever they wanted . In the same way , the Son of Man will suffer at their hands . ”
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist .
40017014	When they came to the crowd , a man came to him , knelt before him ,
40017015	and said , “ Lord , have mercy on my son , because he has seizures and suffers terribly , for he often falls into the fire and into the water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples , but they were not able to heal him . ”
40017017	Jesus answered , “ You unbelieving and perverse generation ! How much longer must I be with you ? How much longer must I endure you ? Bring him here to me . ”
40017018	Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him , and the boy was healed from that moment .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said , “ Why couldn’t we cast it out ? ”
40017020	He told them , “ It was because of your little faith . I tell you the truth , if you have faith the size of a mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move ; nothing will be impossible for you . ”
40017022	When they gathered together in Galilee , Jesus told them , “ The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men .
40017023	They will kill him , and on the third day he will be raised . ” And they became greatly distressed .
40017024	After they arrived in Capernaum , the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said , “ Your teacher pays the double drachma tax , doesn’t he ? ”
40017025	He said , “ Yes . ” When Peter came into the house , Jesus spoke to him first , “ What do you think , Simon ? From whom do earthly kings collect tolls or taxes – from their sons or from foreigners ? ”
40017026	After he said , “ From foreigners , ” Jesus said to him , “ Then the sons are free .
40017027	But so that we don’t offend them , go to the lake and throw out a hook . Take the first fish that comes up , and when you open its mouth , you will find a four drachma coin . Take that and give it to them for me and you . ”
40018001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying , “ Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? ”
40018002	He called a child , had him stand among them ,
40018003	and said , “ I tell you the truth , unless you turn around and become like little children , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven !
40018004	Whoever then humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me .
40018006	“ But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a huge millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the open sea .
40018007	Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks ! It is necessary that stumbling blocks come , but woe to the person through whom they come .
40018008	If your hand or your foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire .
40018009	And if your eye causes you to sin , tear it out and throw it away . It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into fiery hell .
40018010	“ See that you do not disdain one of these little ones . For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven .
40018012	What do you think ? If someone owns a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go look for the one that went astray ?
40018013	And if he finds it , I tell you the truth , he will rejoice more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray .
40018014	In the same way , your Father in heaven is not willing that one of these little ones be lost .
40018015	“ If your brother sins , go and show him his fault when the two of you are alone . If he listens to you , you have regained your brother .
40018016	But if he does not listen , take one or two others with you , so that at the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established .
40018017	If he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the church . If he refuses to listen to the church , treat him like a Gentile or a tax collector .
40018018	“ I tell you the truth , whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven , and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven .
40018019	Again , I tell you the truth , if two of you on earth agree about whatever you ask , my Father in heaven will do it for you .
40018020	For where two or three are assembled in my name , I am there among them . ”
40018021	Then Peter came to him and said , “ Lord , how many times must I forgive my brother who sins against me ? As many as seven times ? ”
40018022	Jesus said to him , “ Not seven times , I tell you , but seventy-seven times !
40018023	“ For this reason , the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves .
40018024	As he began settling his accounts , a man who owed ten thousand talents was brought to him .
40018025	Because he was not able to repay it , the lord ordered him to be sold , along with his wife , children , and whatever he possessed , and repayment to be made .
40018026	Then the slave threw himself to the ground before him , saying , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will repay you everything . ’
40018027	The lord had compassion on that slave and released him , and forgave him the debt .
40018028	After he went out , that same slave found one of his fellow slaves who owed him one hundred silver coins . So he grabbed him by the throat and started to choke him , saying , ‘ Pay back what you owe me ! ’
40018029	Then his fellow slave threw himself down and begged him , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will repay you . ’
40018030	But he refused . Instead , he went out and threw him in prison until he repaid the debt .
40018031	When his fellow slaves saw what had happened , they were very upset and went and told their lord everything that had taken place .
40018032	Then his lord called the first slave and said to him , ‘ Evil slave ! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me !
40018033	Should you not have shown mercy to your fellow slave , just as I showed it to you ? ’
40018034	And in anger his lord turned him over to the prison guards to torture him until he repaid all he owed .
40018035	So also my heavenly Father will do to you , if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart . ”
40019001	Now when Jesus finished these sayings , he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River .
40019002	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	Then some Pharisees came to him in order to test him . They asked , “ Is it lawful to divorce a wife for any cause ? ”
40019004	He answered , “ Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female ,
40019005	and said , ‘ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife , and the two will become one flesh ’ ?
40019006	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore what God has joined together , let no one separate . ”
40019007	They said to him , “ Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her ? ”
40019008	Jesus said to them , “ Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts , but from the beginning it was not this way .
40019009	Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife , except for immorality , and marries another commits adultery . ”
40019010	The disciples said to him , “ If this is the case of a husband with a wife , it is better not to marry ! ”
40019011	He said to them , “ Not everyone can accept this statement , except those to whom it has been given .
40019012	For there are some eunuchs who were that way from birth , and some who were made eunuchs by others , and some who became eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . The one who is able to accept this should accept it . ”
40019013	Then little children were brought to him for him to lay his hands on them and pray . But the disciples scolded those who brought them .
40019014	But Jesus said , “ Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these . ”
40019015	And he placed his hands on them and went on his way .
40019016	Now someone came up to him and said , “ Teacher , what good thing must I do to gain eternal life ? ”
40019017	He said to him , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? There is only one who is good . But if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . ”
40019018	“ Which ones ? ” he asked . Jesus replied , “ Do not murder , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not give false testimony ,
40019019	honor your father and mother , and love your neighbor as yourself . ”
40019020	The young man said to him , “ I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws . What do I still lack ? ”
40019021	Jesus said to him , “ If you wish to be perfect , go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me . ”
40019022	But when the young man heard this he went away sorrowful , for he was very rich .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ I tell you the truth , it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven !
40019024	Again I say , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God . ”
40019025	The disciples were greatly astonished when they heard this and said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
40019026	Jesus looked at them and replied , “ This is impossible for mere humans , but for God all things are possible . ”
40019027	Then Peter said to him , “ Look , we have left everything to follow you ! What then will there be for us ? ”
40019028	Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth : In the age when all things are renewed , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many who are first will be last , and the last first .
40020001	“ For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard .
40020002	And after agreeing with the workers for the standard wage , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	When it was about nine o’clock in the morning , he went out again and saw others standing around in the marketplace without work .
40020004	He said to them , ‘ You go into the vineyard too , and I will give you whatever is right . ’
40020005	So they went . When he went out again about noon and three o’clock that afternoon , he did the same thing .
40020006	And about five o’clock that afternoon he went out and found others standing around , and said to them , ‘ Why are you standing here all day without work ? ’
40020007	They said to him , ‘ Because no one hired us . ’ He said to them , ‘ You go and work in the vineyard too . ’
40020008	When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his manager , ‘ Call the workers and give the pay starting with the last hired until the first . ’
40020009	When those hired about five o’clock came , each received a full day’s pay .
40020010	And when those hired first came , they thought they would receive more . But each one also received the standard wage .
40020011	When they received it , they began to complain against the landowner ,
40020012	saying , ‘ These last fellows worked one hour , and you have made them equal to us who bore the hardship and burning heat of the day . ’
40020013	And the landowner replied to one of them , ‘ Friend , I am not treating you unfairly . Didn’t you agree with me to work for the standard wage ?
40020014	Take what is yours and go . I want to give to this last man the same as I gave to you .
40020015	Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me ? Or are you envious because I am generous ? ’
40020016	So the last will be first , and the first last . ”
40020017	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve aside privately and said to them on the way ,
40020018	“ Look , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the experts in the law . They will condemn him to death ,
40020019	and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged severely and crucified . Yet on the third day , he will be raised . ”
40020020	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons , and kneeling down she asked him for a favor .
40020021	He said to her , “ What do you want ? ” She replied , “ Permit these two sons of mine to sit , one at your right hand and one at your left , in your kingdom . ”
40020022	Jesus answered , “ You don’t know what you are asking ! Are you able to drink the cup I am about to drink ? ” They said to him , “ We are able . ”
40020023	He told them , “ You will drink my cup , but to sit at my right and at my left is not mine to give . Rather , it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father . ”
40020024	Now when the other ten heard this , they were angry with the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called them and said , “ You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and those in high positions use their authority over them .
40020026	It must not be this way among you ! Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant ,
40020027	and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave –
40020028	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . ”
40020029	As they were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed them .
40020030	Two blind men were sitting by the road . When they heard that Jesus was passing by , they shouted , “ Have mercy on us , Lord , Son of David ! ”
40020031	The crowd scolded them to get them to be quiet . But they shouted even more loudly , “ Lord , have mercy on us , Son of David ! ”
40020032	Jesus stopped , called them , and said , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
40020033	They said to him , “ Lord , let our eyes be opened . ”
40020034	Moved with compassion , Jesus touched their eyes . Immediately they received their sight and followed him .
40021001	Now when they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage , at the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	telling them , “ Go to the village ahead of you . Right away you will find a donkey tied there , and a colt with her . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , you are to say , ‘ The Lord needs them , ’ and he will send them at once . ”
40021004	This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet :
40021005	“ Tell the people of Zion , ‘ Look , your king is coming to you , unassuming and seated on a donkey , and on a colt , the foal of a donkey . ’ ”
40021006	So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them , and he sat on them .
40021008	A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road . Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	The crowds that went ahead of him and those following kept shouting , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
40021010	As he entered Jerusalem the whole city was thrown into an uproar , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
40021011	And the crowds were saying , “ This is the prophet Jesus , from Nazareth in Galilee . ”
40021012	Then Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple courts , and turned over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves .
40021013	And he said to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house will be called a house of prayer , ’ but you are turning it into a den of robbers ! ”
40021014	The blind and lame came to him in the temple courts , and he healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the experts in the law saw the wonderful things he did and heard the children crying out in the temple courts , “ Hosanna to the Son of David , ” they became indignant
40021016	and said to him , “ Do you hear what they are saying ? ” Jesus said to them , “ Yes . Have you never read , ‘ Out of the mouths of children and nursing infants you have prepared praise for yourself ’ ? ”
40021017	And leaving them , he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there .
40021018	Now early in the morning , as he returned to the city , he was hungry .
40021019	After noticing a fig tree by the road he went to it , but found nothing on it except leaves . He said to it , “ Never again will there be fruit from you ! ” And the fig tree withered at once .
40021020	When the disciples saw it they were amazed , saying , “ How did the fig tree wither so quickly ? ”
40021021	Jesus answered them , “ I tell you the truth , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only will you do what was done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ’ it will happen .
40021022	And whatever you ask in prayer , if you believe , you will receive . ”
40021023	Now after Jesus entered the temple courts , the chief priests and elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching and said , “ By what authority are you doing these things , and who gave you this authority ? ”
40021024	Jesus answered them , “ I will also ask you one question . If you answer me then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things .
40021025	Where did John’s baptism come from ? From heaven or from people ? ” They discussed this among themselves , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
40021026	But if we say , ‘ From people , ’ we fear the crowd , for they all consider John to be a prophet . ”
40021027	So they answered Jesus , “ We don’t know . ” Then he said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
40021028	“ What do you think ? A man had two sons . He went to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work in the vineyard today . ’
40021029	The boy answered , ‘ I will not . ’ But later he had a change of heart and went .
40021030	The father went to the other son and said the same thing . This boy answered , ‘ I will , sir , ’ but did not go .
40021031	Which of the two did his father’s will ? ” They said , “ The first . ” Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , tax collectors and prostitutes will go ahead of you into the kingdom of God !
40021032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him . But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe . Although you saw this , you did not later change your minds and believe him .
40021033	“ Listen to another parable : There was a landowner who planted a vineyard . He put a fence around it , dug a pit for its winepress , and built a watchtower . Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey .
40021034	When the harvest time was near , he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his portion of the crop .
40021035	But the tenants seized his slaves , beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
40021036	Again he sent other slaves , more than the first , and they treated them the same way .
40021037	Finally he sent his son to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
40021038	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let’s kill him and get his inheritance ! ’
40021039	So they seized him , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
40021040	Now when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? ”
40021041	They said to him , “ He will utterly destroy those evil men ! Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his portion at the harvest . ”
40021042	Jesus said to them , “ Have you never read in the scriptures : ‘ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone . This is from the Lord , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ?
40021043	For this reason I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit .
40021044	The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , and the one on whom it falls will be crushed . ”
40021045	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they realized that he was speaking about them .
40021046	They wanted to arrest him , but they were afraid of the crowds , because the crowds regarded him as a prophet .
40022001	Jesus spoke to them again in parables , saying :
40022002	“ The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son .
40022003	He sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the banquet , but they would not come .
40022004	Again he sent other slaves , saying , ‘ Tell those who have been invited , “ Look ! The feast I have prepared for you is ready . My oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding banquet . ” ’
40022005	But they were indifferent and went away , one to his farm , another to his business .
40022006	The rest seized his slaves , insolently mistreated them , and killed them .
40022007	The king was furious ! He sent his soldiers , and they put those murderers to death and set their city on fire .
40022008	Then he said to his slaves , ‘ The wedding is ready , but the ones who had been invited were not worthy .
40022009	So go into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet . ’
40022010	And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all they found , both bad and good , and the wedding hall was filled with guests .
40022011	But when the king came in to see the wedding guests , he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes .
40022012	And he said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you get in here without wedding clothes ? ’ But he had nothing to say .
40022013	Then the king said to his attendants , ‘ Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth ! ’
40022014	For many are called , but few are chosen . ”
40022015	Then the Pharisees went out and planned together to entrap him with his own words .
40022016	They sent to him their disciples along with the Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that you are truthful , and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . You do not court anyone’s favor because you show no partiality .
40022017	Tell us then , what do you think ? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
40022018	But Jesus realized their evil intentions and said , “ Hypocrites ! Why are you testing me ?
40022019	Show me the coin used for the tax . ” So they brought him a denarius .
40022020	Jesus said to them , “ Whose image is this , and whose inscription ? ”
40022021	They replied , “ Caesar’s . ” He said to them , “ Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ”
40022022	Now when they heard this they were stunned , and they left him and went away .
40022023	The same day Sadducees ( who say there is no resurrection ) came to him and asked him ,
40022024	“ Teacher , Moses said , ‘ If a man dies without having children , his brother must marry the widow and father children for his brother . ’
40022025	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first one married and died , and since he had no children he left his wife to his brother .
40022026	The second did the same , and the third , down to the seventh .
40022027	Last of all , the woman died .
40022028	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had married her . ”
40022029	Jesus answered them , “ You are deceived , because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God .
40022030	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
40022031	Now as for the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken to you by God ,
40022032	‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living ! ”
40022033	When the crowds heard this , they were amazed at his teaching .
40022034	Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees , they assembled together .
40022035	And one of them , an expert in religious law , asked him a question to test him :
40022036	“ Teacher , which commandment in the law is the greatest ? ”
40022037	Jesus said to him , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind . ’
40022038	This is the first and greatest commandment .
40022039	The second is like it : ‘ Love your neighbor as yourself . ’
40022040	All the law and the prophets depend on these two commandments . ”
40022041	While the Pharisees were assembled , Jesus asked them a question :
40022042	“ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They said , “ The son of David . ”
40022043	He said to them , “ How then does David by the Spirit call him ‘ Lord , ’ saying ,
40022044	‘ The Lord said to my lord , “ Sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies under your feet ” ’ ?
40022045	If David then calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how can he be his son ? ”
40022046	No one was able to answer him a word , and from that day on no one dared to question him any longer .
40023001	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples ,
40023002	“ The experts in the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat .
40023003	Therefore pay attention to what they tell you and do it . But do not do what they do , for they do not practice what they teach .
40023004	They tie up heavy loads , hard to carry , and put them on men’s shoulders , but they themselves are not willing even to lift a finger to move them .
40023005	They do all their deeds to be seen by people , for they make their phylacteries wide and their tassels long .
40023006	They love the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues
40023007	and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces , and to have people call them ‘ Rabbi . ’
40023008	But you are not to be called ‘ Rabbi , ’ for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers .
40023009	And call no one your ‘ father ’ on earth , for you have one Father , who is in heaven .
40023010	Nor are you to be called ‘ teacher , ’ for you have one teacher , the Christ .
40023011	The greatest among you will be your servant .
40023012	And whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted .
40023013	“ But woe to you , experts in the law and you Pharisees , hypocrites ! You keep locking people out of the kingdom of heaven ! For you neither enter nor permit those trying to enter to go in .
40023015	“ Woe to you , experts in the law and you Pharisees , hypocrites ! You cross land and sea to make one convert , and when you get one , you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves !
40023016	“ Woe to you , blind guides , who say , ‘ Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing . But whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by the oath . ’
40023017	Blind fools ! Which is greater , the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred ?
40023018	And , ‘ Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing . But if anyone swears by the gift on it he is bound by the oath . ’
40023019	You are blind ! For which is greater , the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred ?
40023020	So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it .
40023021	And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and the one who dwells in it .
40023022	And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and the one who sits on it .
40023023	“ Woe to you , experts in the law and you Pharisees , hypocrites ! You give a tenth of mint , dill , and cumin , yet you neglect what is more important in the law – justice , mercy , and faithfulness ! You should have done these things without neglecting the others .
40023024	Blind guides ! You strain out a gnat yet swallow a camel !
40023025	“ Woe to you , experts in the law and you Pharisees , hypocrites ! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish , but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence .
40023026	Blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup , so that the outside may become clean too !
40023027	“ Woe to you , experts in the law and you Pharisees , hypocrites ! You are like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean .
40023028	In the same way , on the outside you look righteous to people , but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness .
40023029	“ Woe to you , experts in the law and you Pharisees , hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous .
40023030	And you say , ‘ If we had lived in the days of our ancestors , we would not have participated with them in shedding the blood of the prophets . ’
40023031	By saying this you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Fill up then the measure of your ancestors !
40023033	You snakes , you offspring of vipers ! How will you escape being condemned to hell ?
40023034	“ For this reason I am sending you prophets and wise men and experts in the law , some of whom you will kill and crucify , and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town ,
40023035	so that on you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah , whom you murdered between the temple and the altar .
40023036	I tell you the truth , this generation will be held responsible for all these things !
40023037	“ O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you ! How often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you would have none of it !
40023038	Look , your house is left to you desolate !
40023039	For I tell you , you will not see me from now until you say , ‘ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ ”
40024001	Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts and walking away , his disciples came to show him the temple buildings .
40024002	And he said to them , “ Do you see all these things ? I tell you the truth , not one stone will be left on another . All will be torn down ! ”
40024003	As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives , his disciples came to him privately and said , “ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age ? ”
40024004	Jesus answered them , “ Watch out that no one misleads you .
40024005	For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Christ , ’ and they will mislead many .
40024006	You will hear of wars and rumors of wars . Make sure that you are not alarmed , for this must happen , but the end is still to come .
40024007	For nation will rise up in arms against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . And there will be famines and earthquakes in various places .
40024008	All these things are the beginning of birth pains .
40024009	“ Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you . You will be hated by all the nations because of my name .
40024010	Then many will be led into sin , and they will betray one another and hate one another .
40024011	And many false prophets will appear and deceive many ,
40024012	and because lawlessness will increase so much , the love of many will grow cold .
40024013	But the person who endures to the end will be saved .
40024014	And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole inhabited earth as a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
40024015	“ So when you see the abomination of desolation – spoken about by Daniel the prophet – standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
40024016	then those in Judea must flee to the mountains .
40024017	The one on the roof must not come down to take anything out of his house ,
40024018	and the one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak .
40024019	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days !
40024020	Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath .
40024021	For then there will be great suffering unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of the world until now , or ever will happen .
40024022	And if those days had not been cut short , no one would be saved . But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short .
40024023	Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or ‘ There he is ! ’ do not believe him .
40024024	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
40024025	Remember , I have told you ahead of time .
40024026	So then , if someone says to you , ‘ Look , he is in the wilderness , ’ do not go out , or ‘ Look , he is in the inner rooms , ’ do not believe him .
40024027	For just like the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west , so the coming of the Son of Man will be .
40024028	Wherever the corpse is , there the vultures will gather .
40024029	“ Immediately after the suffering of those days , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ; the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers of heaven will be shaken .
40024030	Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven , and all the tribes of the earth will mourn . They will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40024031	And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet blast , and they will gather his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
40024032	“ Learn this parable from the fig tree : Whenever its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves , you know that summer is near .
40024033	So also you , when you see all these things , know that he is near , right at the door .
40024034	I tell you the truth , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
40024036	“ But as for that day and hour no one knows it – not even the angels in heaven – except the Father alone .
40024037	For just like the days of Noah were , so the coming of the Son of Man will be .
40024038	For in those days before the flood , people were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day Noah entered the ark .
40024039	And they knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away . It will be the same at the coming of the Son of Man .
40024040	Then there will be two men in the field ; one will be taken and one left .
40024041	There will be two women grinding grain with a mill ; one will be taken and one left .
40024042	“ Therefore stay alert , because you do not know on what day your Lord will come .
40024043	But understand this : If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming , he would have been alert and would not have let his house be broken into .
40024044	Therefore you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him .
40024045	“ Who then is the faithful and wise slave , whom the master has put in charge of his household , to give the other slaves their food at the proper time ?
40024046	Blessed is that slave whom the master finds at work when he comes .
40024047	I tell you the truth , the master will put him in charge of all his possessions .
40024048	But if that evil slave should say to himself , ‘ My master is staying away a long time , ’
40024049	and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with drunkards ,
40024050	then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee ,
40024051	and will cut him in two , and assign him a place with the hypocrites , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40025001	“ At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of the virgins were foolish , and five were wise .
40025003	When the foolish ones took their lamps , they did not take extra olive oil with them .
40025004	But the wise ones took flasks of olive oil with their lamps .
40025005	When the bridegroom was delayed a long time , they all became drowsy and fell asleep .
40025006	But at midnight there was a shout , ‘ Look , the bridegroom is here ! Come out to meet him . ’
40025007	Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	The foolish ones said to the wise , ‘ Give us some of your oil , because our lamps are going out . ’
40025009	‘ No , ’ they replied . ‘ There won’t be enough for you and for us . Go instead to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves . ’
40025010	But while they had gone to buy it , the bridegroom arrived , and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding banquet . Then the door was shut .
40025011	Later , the other virgins came too , saying , ‘ Lord , lord ! Let us in ! ’
40025012	But he replied , ‘ I tell you the truth , I do not know you ! ’
40025013	Therefore stay alert , because you do not know the day or the hour .
40025014	“ For it is like a man going on a journey , who summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them .
40025015	To one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one , each according to his ability . Then he went on his journey .
40025016	The one who had received five talents went off right away and put his money to work and gained five more .
40025017	In the same way , the one who had two gained two more .
40025018	But the one who had received one talent went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money in it .
40025019	After a long time , the master of those slaves came and settled his accounts with them .
40025020	The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more , saying , ‘ Sir , you entrusted me with five talents . See , I have gained five more . ’
40025021	His master answered , ‘ Well done , good and faithful slave ! You have been faithful in a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025022	The one with the two talents also came and said , ‘ Sir , you entrusted two talents to me . See , I have gained two more . ’
40025023	His master answered , ‘ Well done , good and faithful slave ! You have been faithful with a few things . I will put you in charge of many things . Enter into the joy of your master . ’
40025024	Then the one who had received the one talent came and said , ‘ Sir , I knew that you were a hard man , harvesting where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter seed ,
40025025	so I was afraid , and I went and hid your talent in the ground . See , you have what is yours . ’
40025026	But his master answered , ‘ Evil and lazy slave ! So you knew that I harvest where I didn’t sow and gather where I didn’t scatter ?
40025027	Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers , and on my return I would have received my money back with interest !
40025028	Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten .
40025029	For the one who has will be given more , and he will have more than enough . But the one who does not have , even what he has will be taken from him .
40025030	And throw that worthless slave into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . ’
40025031	“ When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him , then he will sit on his glorious throne .
40025032	All the nations will be assembled before him , and he will separate people one from another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
40025034	Then the king will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed by my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
40025035	For I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , I was a stranger and you invited me in ,
40025036	I was naked and you gave me clothing , I was sick and you took care of me , I was in prison and you visited me . ’
40025037	Then the righteous will answer him , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you something to drink ?
40025038	When did we see you a stranger and invite you in , or naked and clothe you ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you ? ’
40025040	And the king will answer them , ‘ I tell you the truth , just as you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of mine , you did it for me . ’
40025041	“ Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Depart from me , you accursed , into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels !
40025042	For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat , I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink .
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not receive me as a guest , naked and you did not clothe me , sick and in prison and you did not visit me . ’
40025044	Then they too will answer , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not give you whatever you needed ? ’
40025045	Then he will answer them , ‘ I tell you the truth , just as you did not do it for one of the least of these , you did not do it for me . ’
40025046	And these will depart into eternal punishment , but the righteous into eternal life . ”
40026001	When Jesus had finished saying all these things , he told his disciples ,
40026002	“ You know that after two days the Passover is coming , and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified . ”
40026003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the palace of the high priest , who was named Caiaphas .
40026004	They planned to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him .
40026005	But they said , “ Not during the feast , so that there won’t be a riot among the people . ”
40026006	Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfumed oil , and she poured it on his head as he was at the table .
40026008	When the disciples saw this , they became indignant and said , “ Why this waste ?
40026009	It could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor ! ”
40026010	When Jesus learned of this , he said to them , “ Why are you bothering this woman ? She has done a good service for me .
40026011	For you will always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me !
40026012	When she poured this oil on my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
40026013	I tell you the truth , wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world , what she has done will also be told in memory of her . ”
40026014	Then one of the twelve , the one named Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
40026015	and said , “ What will you give me to betray him into your hands ? ” So they set out thirty silver coins for him .
40026016	From that time on , Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray him .
40026017	Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? ”
40026018	He said , “ Go into the city to a certain man and tell him , ‘ The Teacher says , “ My time is near . I will observe the Passover with my disciples at your house . ” ’ ”
40026019	So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them , and they prepared the Passover .
40026020	When it was evening , he took his place at the table with the twelve .
40026021	And while they were eating he said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you will betray me . ”
40026022	They became greatly distressed and each one began to say to him , “ Surely not I , Lord ? ”
40026023	He answered , “ The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man will go as it is written about him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would be better for him if he had never been born . ”
40026025	Then Judas , the one who would betray him , said , “ Surely not I , Rabbi ? ” Jesus replied , “ You have said it yourself . ”
40026026	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , and after giving thanks he broke it , gave it to his disciples , and said , “ Take , eat , this is my body . ”
40026027	And after taking the cup and giving thanks , he gave it to them , saying , “ Drink from it , all of you ,
40026028	for this is my blood , the blood of the covenant , that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	I tell you , from now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom . ”
40026030	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , “ This night you will all fall away because of me , for it is written : ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ’
40026032	But after I am raised , I will go ahead of you into Galilee . ”
40026033	Peter said to him , “ If they all fall away because of you , I will never fall away ! ”
40026034	Jesus said to him , “ I tell you the truth , on this night , before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . ”
40026035	Peter said to him , “ Even if I must die with you , I will never deny you . ” And all the disciples said the same thing .
40026036	Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to the disciples , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray . ”
40026037	He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and became anguished and distressed .
40026038	Then he said to them , “ My soul is deeply grieved , even to the point of death . Remain here and stay awake with me . ”
40026039	Going a little farther , he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed , “ My Father , if possible , let this cup pass from me ! Yet not what I will , but what you will . ”
40026040	Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping . He said to Peter , “ So , couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour ?
40026041	Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
40026042	He went away a second time and prayed , “ My Father , if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it , your will must be done . ”
40026043	He came again and found them sleeping ; they could not keep their eyes open .
40026044	So leaving them again , he went away and prayed for the third time , saying the same thing once more .
40026045	Then he came to the disciples and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Look , the hour is approaching , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Get up , let us go . Look ! My betrayer is approaching ! ”
40026047	While he was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , arrived . With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs , sent by the chief priests and elders of the people .
40026048	( Now the betrayer had given them a sign , saying , “ The one I kiss is the man . Arrest him ! ” )
40026049	Immediately he went up to Jesus and said , “ Greetings , Rabbi , ” and kissed him .
40026050	Jesus said to him , “ Friend , do what you are here to do . ” Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him .
40026051	But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword , drew it out , and struck the high priest’s slave , cutting off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him , “ Put your sword back in its place ! For all who take hold of the sword will die by the sword .
40026053	Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father , and that he would send me more than twelve legions of angels right now ?
40026054	How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled ? ”
40026055	At that moment Jesus said to the crowd , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw ? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts , yet you did not arrest me .
40026056	But this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled . ” Then all the disciples left him and fled .
40026057	Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas , the high priest , in whose house the experts in the law and the elders had gathered .
40026058	But Peter was following him from a distance , all the way to the high priest’s courtyard . After going in , he sat with the guards to see the outcome .
40026059	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death .
40026060	But they did not find anything , though many false witnesses came forward . Finally two came forward
40026061	and declared , “ This man said , ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days . ’ ”
40026062	So the high priest stood up and said to him , “ Have you no answer ? What is this that they are testifying against you ? ”
40026063	But Jesus was silent . The high priest said to him , “ I charge you under oath by the living God , tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God . ”
40026064	Jesus said to him , “ You have said it yourself . But I tell you , from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven . ”
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared , “ He has blasphemed ! Why do we still need witnesses ? Now you have heard the blasphemy !
40026066	What is your verdict ? ” They answered , “ He is guilty and deserves death . ”
40026067	Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists . And some slapped him ,
40026068	saying , “ Prophesy for us , you Christ ! Who hit you ? ”
40026069	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard . A slave girl came to him and said , “ You also were with Jesus the Galilean . ”
40026070	But he denied it in front of them all : “ I don’t know what you’re talking about ! ”
40026071	When he went out to the gateway , another slave girl saw him and said to the people there , “ This man was with Jesus the Nazarene . ”
40026072	He denied it again with an oath , “ I do not know the man ! ”
40026073	After a little while , those standing there came up to Peter and said , “ You really are one of them too – even your accent gives you away ! ”
40026074	At that he began to curse , and he swore with an oath , “ I do not know the man ! ” At that moment a rooster crowed .
40026075	Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said : “ Before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times . ” And he went outside and wept bitterly .
40027001	When it was early in the morning , all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him .
40027002	They tied him up , led him away , and handed him over to Pilate the governor .
40027003	Now when Judas , who had betrayed him , saw that Jesus had been condemned , he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders ,
40027004	saying , “ I have sinned by betraying innocent blood ! ” But they said , “ What is that to us ? You take care of it yourself ! ”
40027005	So Judas threw the silver coins into the temple and left . Then he went out and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests took the silver and said , “ It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury , since it is blood money . ”
40027007	After consulting together they bought the Potter’s Field with it , as a burial place for foreigners .
40027008	For this reason that field has been called the “ Field of Blood ” to this day .
40027009	Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled : “ They took the thirty silver coins , the price of the one whose price had been set by the people of Israel ,
40027010	and they gave them for the potter’s field , as the Lord commanded me . ”
40027011	Then Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus said , “ You say so . ”
40027012	But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders , he did not respond .
40027013	Then Pilate said to him , “ Don’t you hear how many charges they are bringing against you ? ”
40027014	But he did not answer even one accusation , so that the governor was quite amazed .
40027015	During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd , whomever they wanted .
40027016	At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas .
40027017	So after they had assembled , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release for you , Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ ? ”
40027018	( For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy . )
40027019	As he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent a message to him : “ Have nothing to do with that innocent man ; I have suffered greatly as a result of a dream about him today . ”
40027020	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed .
40027021	The governor asked them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas ! ”
40027022	Pilate said to them , “ Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ ? ” They all said , “ Crucify him ! ”
40027023	He asked , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” But they shouted more insistently , “ Crucify him ! ”
40027024	When Pilate saw that he could do nothing , but that instead a riot was starting , he took some water , washed his hands before the crowd and said , “ I am innocent of this man’s blood . You take care of it yourselves ! ”
40027025	In reply all the people said , “ Let his blood be on us and on our children ! ”
40027026	Then he released Barabbas for them . But after he had Jesus flogged , he handed him over to be crucified .
40027027	Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort around him .
40027028	They stripped him and put a scarlet robe around him ,
40027029	and after braiding a crown of thorns , they put it on his head . They put a staff in his right hand , and kneeling down before him , they mocked him : “ Hail , king of the Jews ! ”
40027030	They spat on him and took the staff and struck him repeatedly on the head .
40027031	When they had mocked him , they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him away to crucify him .
40027032	As they were going out , they found a man from Cyrene named Simon , whom they forced to carry his cross .
40027033	They came to a place called Golgotha ( which means “ Place of the Skull ” )
40027034	and offered Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink . But after tasting it , he would not drink it .
40027035	When they had crucified him , they divided his clothes by throwing dice .
40027036	Then they sat down and kept guard over him there .
40027037	Above his head they put the charge against him , which read : “ This is Jesus , the king of the Jews . ”
40027038	Then two outlaws were crucified with him , one on his right and one on his left .
40027039	Those who passed by defamed him , shaking their heads
40027040	and saying , “ You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save yourself ! If you are God’s Son , come down from the cross ! ”
40027041	In the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law and elders – were mocking him :
40027042	“ He saved others , but he cannot save himself ! He is the king of Israel ! If he comes down now from the cross , we will believe in him !
40027043	H e trusts in God – let God , if he wants to , deliver him now because he said , ‘ I am God’s Son ’ ! ”
40027044	The robbers who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him .
40027045	Now from noon until three , darkness came over all the land .
40027046	At about three o’clock Jesus shouted with a loud voice , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” that is , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
40027047	When some of the bystanders heard it , they said , “ This man is calling for Elijah . ”
40027048	Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge , filled it with sour wine , put it on a stick , and gave it to him to drink .
40027049	But the rest said , “ Leave him alone ! Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him . ”
40027050	Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit .
40027051	Just then the temple curtain was torn in two , from top to bottom . The earth shook and the rocks were split apart .
40027052	And tombs were opened , and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised .
40027053	( They came out of the tombs after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people . )
40027054	Now when the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place , they were extremely terrified and said , “ Truly this one was God’s Son ! ”
40027055	Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and given him support were also there , watching from a distance .
40027056	Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
40027057	Now when it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who was also a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him .
40027059	Joseph took the body , wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
40027060	and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock . Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away .
40027061	( Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there , opposite the tomb . )
40027062	The next day ( which is after the day of preparation ) the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate
40027063	and said , “ Sir , we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said , ‘ After three days I will rise again . ’
40027064	So give orders to secure the tomb until the third day . Otherwise his disciples may come and steal his body and say to the people , ‘ He has been raised from the dead , ’ and the last deception will be worse than the first . ”
40027065	Pilate said to them , “ Take a guard of soldiers . Go and make it as secure as you can . ”
40027066	So they went with the soldiers of the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone .
40028001	Now after the Sabbath , at dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb .
40028002	Suddenly there was a severe earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat on it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
40028004	The guards were shaken and became like dead men because they were so afraid of him .
40028005	But the angel said to the women , “ Do not be afraid ; I know that you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here , for he has been raised , just as he said . Come and see the place where he was lying .
40028007	Then go quickly and tell his disciples , ‘ He has been raised from the dead . He is going ahead of you into Galilee . You will see him there . ’ Listen , I have told you ! ”
40028008	So they left the tomb quickly , with fear and great joy , and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	But Jesus met them , saying , “ Greetings ! ” They came to him , held on to his feet and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do not be afraid . Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee . They will see me there . ”
40028011	While they were going , some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened .
40028012	After they had assembled with the elders and formed a plan , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers ,
40028013	telling them , “ You are to say , ‘ His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were asleep . ’
40028014	If this matter is heard before the governor , we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble . ”
40028015	So they took the money and did as they were instructed . And this story is told among the Jews to this day .
40028016	So the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had designated .
40028017	When they saw him , they worshiped him , but some doubted .
40028018	Then Jesus came up and said to them , “ All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
40028019	Therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you . And remember , I am with you always , to the end of the age . ”
41001001	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	As it is written in Isaiah the prophet , “ Look , I am sending my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way ,
41001003	the voice of one shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord , make his paths straight . ’ ”
41001004	In the wilderness John the baptizer began preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
41001005	People from the whole Judean countryside and all of Jerusalem were going out to him , and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins .
41001006	John wore a garment made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	He proclaimed , “ One more powerful than I am is coming after me ; I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals .
41001008	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . ”
41001009	Now in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River .
41001010	And just as Jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Spirit descending on him like a dove .
41001011	And a voice came from heaven : “ You are my one dear Son ; in you I take great delight . ”
41001012	The Spirit immediately drove him into the wilderness .
41001013	He was in the wilderness forty days , enduring temptations from Satan . He was with wild animals , and angels were ministering to his needs .
41001014	Now after John was imprisoned , Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God .
41001015	He said , “ The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is near . Repent and believe the gospel ! ”
41001016	As he went along the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew , Simon’s brother , casting a net into the sea ( for they were fishermen ) .
41001017	Jesus said to them , “ Follow me , and I will turn you into fishers of people . ”
41001018	They left their nets immediately and followed him .
41001019	Going on a little farther , he saw James , the son of Zebedee , and John his brother in their boat mending nets .
41001020	Immediately he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him .
41001021	Then they went to Capernaum . When the Sabbath came , Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach .
41001022	The people there were amazed by his teaching , because he taught them like one who had authority , not like the experts in the law .
41001023	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit , and he cried out ,
41001024	“ Leave us alone , Jesus the Nazarene ! Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are – the Holy One of God ! ”
41001025	But Jesus rebuked him : “ Silence ! Come out of him ! ”
41001026	After throwing him into convulsions , the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him .
41001027	They were all amazed so that they asked each other , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority ! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him . ”
41001028	So the news about him spread quickly throughout all the region around Galilee .
41001029	Now as soon as they left the synagogue , they entered Simon and Andrew’s house , with James and John .
41001030	Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down , sick with a fever , so they spoke to Jesus at once about her .
41001031	He came and raised her up by gently taking her hand . Then the fever left her and she began to serve them .
41001032	When it was evening , after sunset , they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed .
41001033	The whole town gathered by the door .
41001034	So he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons . But he would not permit the demons to speak , because they knew him .
41001035	Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark , departed , and went out to a deserted place , and there he spent time in prayer .
41001036	Simon and his companions searched for him .
41001037	When they found him , they said , “ Everyone is looking for you . ”
41001038	He replied , “ Let us go elsewhere , into the surrounding villages , so that I can preach there too . For that is what I came out here to do . ”
41001039	So he went into all of Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons .
41001040	Now a leper came to him and fell to his knees , asking for help . “ If you are willing , you can make me clean , ” he said .
41001041	Moved with compassion , Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing . Be clean ! ”
41001042	The leprosy left him at once , and he was clean .
41001043	Immediately Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning .
41001044	He told him , “ See that you do not say anything to anyone , but go , show yourself to a priest , and bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing , as a testimony to them . ”
41001045	But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely , so that Jesus was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside in remote places . Still they kept coming to him from everywhere .
41002001	Now after some days , when he returned to Capernaum , the news spread that he was at home .
41002002	So many gathered that there was no longer any room , not even by the door , and he preached the word to them .
41002003	Some people came bringing to him a paralytic , carried by four of them .
41002004	When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd , they removed the roof above Jesus . Then , after tearing it out , they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on .
41002005	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Son , your sins are forgiven . ”
41002006	Now some of the experts in the law were sitting there , turning these things over in their minds :
41002007	“ Why does this man speak this way ? He is blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
41002008	Now immediately , when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts , he said to them , “ Why are you thinking such things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Stand up , take your stretcher , and walk ’ ?
41002010	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” – he said to the paralytic –
41002011	“ I tell you , stand up , take your stretcher , and go home . ”
41002012	And immediately the man stood up , took his stretcher , and went out in front of them all . They were all amazed and glorified God , saying , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ”
41002013	Jesus went out again by the sea . The whole crowd came to him , and he taught them .
41002014	As he went along , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , sitting at the tax booth . “ Follow me , ” he said to him . And he got up and followed him .
41002015	As Jesus was having a meal in Levi’s home , many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many who followed him .
41002016	When the experts in the law and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors , they said to his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
41002017	When Jesus heard this he said to them , “ Those who are healthy don’t need a physician , but those who are sick do . I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners . ”
41002018	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . So they came to Jesus and said , “ Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples don’t fast ? ”
41002019	Jesus said to them , “ The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them , can they ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they do not fast .
41002020	But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and at that time they will fast .
41002021	No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment ; otherwise , the patch pulls away from it , the new from the old , and the tear becomes worse .
41002022	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins ; otherwise , the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed . Instead new wine is poured into new wineskins . ”
41002023	Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath , and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat as they made their way .
41002024	So the Pharisees said to him , “ Look , why are they doing what is against the law on the Sabbath ? ”
41002025	He said to them , “ Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry –
41002026	how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread , which is against the law for any but the priests to eat , and also gave it to his companions ? ”
41002027	Then he said to them , “ The Sabbath was made for people , not people for the Sabbath .
41002028	For this reason the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath . ”
41003001	Then Jesus entered the synagogue again , and a man was there who had a withered hand .
41003002	They watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath , so that they could accuse him .
41003003	So he said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Stand up among all these people . ”
41003004	Then he said to them , “ Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath , or evil , to save a life or destroy it ? ” But they were silent .
41003005	After looking around at them in anger , grieved by the hardness of their hearts , he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He stretched it out , and his hand was restored .
41003006	So the Pharisees went out immediately and began plotting with the Herodians , as to how they could assassinate him .
41003007	Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea , and a great multitude from Galilee followed him . And from Judea ,
41003008	Jerusalem , Idumea , beyond the Jordan River , and around Tyre and Sidon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the things he had done .
41003009	Because of the crowd , he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so the crowd would not press toward him .
41003010	For he had healed many , so that all who were afflicted with diseases pressed toward him in order to touch him .
41003011	And whenever the unclean spirits saw him , they fell down before him and cried out , “ You are the Son of God . ”
41003012	But he sternly ordered them not to make him known .
41003013	Now Jesus went up the mountain and called for those he wanted , and they came to him .
41003014	He appointed twelve ( whom he named apostles ) , so that they would be with him and he could send them to preach
41003015	and to have authority to cast out demons .
41003016	He appointed twelve : To Simon he gave the name Peter ;
41003017	to James and his brother John , the sons of Zebedee , he gave the name Boanerges ( that is , “ sons of thunder ” ) ;
41003018	and Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
41003020	Now Jesus went home , and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat .
41003021	When his family heard this they went out to restrain him , for they said , “ He is out of his mind . ”
41003022	The experts in the law who came down from Jerusalem said , “ He is possessed by Beelzebul , ” and , “ By the ruler of demons he casts out demons . ”
41003023	So he called them and spoke to them in parables : “ How can Satan cast out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom will not be able to stand .
41003025	If a house is divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
41003026	And if Satan rises against himself and is divided , he is not able to stand and his end has come .
41003027	But no one is able to enter a strong man’s house and steal his property unless he first ties up the strong man . Then he can thoroughly plunder his house .
41003028	I tell you the truth , people will be forgiven for all sins , even all the blasphemies they utter .
41003029	But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven , but is guilty of an eternal sin ”
41003030	( because they said , “ He has an unclean spirit ” ) .
41003031	Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came . Standing outside , they sent word to him , to summon him .
41003032	A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him , “ Look , your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you . ”
41003033	He answered them and said , “ Who are my mother and my brothers ? ”
41003034	And looking at those who were sitting around him in a circle , he said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers !
41003035	For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother . ”
41004001	Again he began to teach by the lake . Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake .
41004002	He taught them many things in parables , and in his teaching said to them :
41004003	“ Listen ! A sower went out to sow .
41004004	And as he sowed , some seed fell along the path , and the birds came and devoured it .
41004005	Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil . It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep .
41004006	When the sun came up it was scorched , and because it did not have sufficient root , it withered .
41004007	Other seed fell among the thorns , and they grew up and choked it , and it did not produce grain .
41004008	But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain , sprouting and growing ; some yielded thirty times as much , some sixty , and some a hundred times . ”
41004009	And he said , “ Whoever has ears to hear had better listen ! ”
41004010	When he was alone , those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables .
41004011	He said to them , “ The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you . But to those outside , everything is in parables ,
41004012	so that although they look they may look but not see , and although they hear they may hear but not understand , so they may not repent and be forgiven . ”
41004013	He said to them , “ Don’t you understand this parable ? Then how will you understand any parable ?
41004014	The sower sows the word .
41004015	These are the ones on the path where the word is sown : Whenever they hear , immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them .
41004016	These are the ones sown on rocky ground : As soon as they hear the word , they receive it with joy .
41004017	But they have no root in themselves and do not endure . Then , when trouble or persecution comes because of the word , immediately they fall away .
41004018	Others are the ones sown among thorns : They are those who hear the word ,
41004019	but worldly cares , the seductiveness of wealth , and the desire for other things come in and choke the word , and it produces nothing .
41004020	But these are the ones sown on good soil : They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit , one thirty times as much , one sixty , and one a hundred . ”
41004021	He also said to them , “ A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed , is it ? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand ?
41004022	For nothing is hidden except to be revealed , and nothing concealed except to be brought to light .
41004023	If anyone has ears to hear , he had better listen ! ”
41004024	And he said to them , “ Take care about what you hear . The measure you use will be the measure you receive , and more will be added to you .
41004025	For whoever has will be given more , but whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken from him . ”
41004026	He also said , “ The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground .
41004027	He goes to sleep and gets up , night and day , and the seed sprouts and grows , though he does not know how .
41004028	By itself the soil produces a crop , first the stalk , then the head , then the full grain in the head .
41004029	And when the grain is ripe , he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come . ”
41004030	He also asked , “ To what can we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable can we use to present it ?
41004031	It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground , even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground –
41004032	when it is sown , it grows up , becomes the greatest of all garden plants , and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade . ”
41004033	So with many parables like these , he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear .
41004034	He did not speak to them without a parable . But privately he explained everything to his own disciples .
41004035	On that day , when evening came , Jesus said to his disciples , “ Let’s go across to the other side of the lake . ”
41004036	So after leaving the crowd , they took him along , just as he was , in the boat , and other boats were with him .
41004037	Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat , so that the boat was nearly swamped .
41004038	But he was in the stern , sleeping on a cushion . They woke him up and said to him , “ Teacher , don’t you care that we are about to die ? ”
41004039	So he got up and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , “ Be quiet ! Calm down ! ” Then the wind stopped , and it was dead calm .
41004040	And he said to them , “ Why are you cowardly ? Do you still not have faith ? ”
41004041	They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another , “ Who then is this ? Even the wind and sea obey him ! ”
41005001	So they came to the other side of the lake , to the region of the Gerasenes .
41005002	Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat , a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him .
41005003	He lived among the tombs , and no one could bind him anymore , not even with a chain .
41005004	For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles , but he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces . No one was strong enough to subdue him .
41005005	Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains , he would cry out and cut himself with stones .
41005006	When he saw Jesus from a distance , he ran and bowed down before him .
41005007	Then he cried out with a loud voice , “ Leave me alone , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ! I implore you by God – do not torment me ! ”
41005008	( For Jesus had said to him , “ Come out of that man , you unclean spirit ! ” )
41005009	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ My name is Legion , for we are many . ”
41005010	He begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region .
41005011	There on the hillside , a great herd of pigs was feeding .
41005012	And the demonic spirits begged him , “ Send us into the pigs . Let us enter them . ”
41005013	Jesus gave them permission . So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs . Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake , and about two thousand were drowned in the lake .
41005014	Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside , and the people went out to see what had happened .
41005015	They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there , clothed and in his right mind – the one who had the “ Legion ” – and they were afraid .
41005016	Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it , and they also told about the pigs .
41005017	Then they asked Jesus to leave their region .
41005018	As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him .
41005019	But Jesus did not permit him to do so . Instead , he said to him , “ Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you , that he had mercy on you . ”
41005020	So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him , and all were amazed .
41005021	When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side , a large crowd gathered around him , and he was by the sea .
41005022	Then one of the synagogue rulers , named Jairus , came up , and when he saw Jesus , he fell at his feet .
41005023	He asked him urgently , “ My little daughter is near death . Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live . ”
41005024	Jesus went with him , and a large crowd followed and pressed around him .
41005025	Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years .
41005026	She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had . Yet instead of getting better , she grew worse .
41005027	When she heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak ,
41005028	for she kept saying , “ If only I touch his clothes , I will be healed . ”
41005029	At once the bleeding stopped , and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease .
41005030	Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him . He turned around in the crowd and said , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
41005031	His disciples said to him , “ You see the crowd pressing against you and you say , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
41005032	But he looked around to see who had done it .
41005033	Then the woman , with fear and trembling , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth .
41005034	He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in peace , and be healed of your disease . ”
41005035	While he was still speaking , people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying , “ Your daughter has died . Why trouble the teacher any longer ? ”
41005036	But Jesus , paying no attention to what was said , told the synagogue ruler , “ Do not be afraid ; just believe . ”
41005037	He did not let anyone follow him except Peter , James , and John , the brother of James .
41005038	They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly .
41005039	When he entered he said to them , “ Why are you distressed and weeping ? The child is not dead but asleep . ”
41005040	And they began making fun of him . But he put them all outside and he took the child’s father and mother and his own companions and went into the room where the child was .
41005041	Then , gently taking the child by the hand , he said to her , “ Talitha koum , ” which means , “ Little girl , I say to you , get up . ”
41005042	The girl got up at once and began to walk around ( she was twelve years old ) . They were completely astonished at this .
41005043	He strictly ordered that no one should know about this , and told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	Now Jesus left that place and came to his hometown , and his disciples followed him .
41006002	When the Sabbath came , he began to teach in the synagogue . Many who heard him were astonished , saying , “ Where did he get these ideas ? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him ? What are these miracles that are done through his hands ?
41006003	Isn’t this the carpenter , the son of Mary and brother of James , Joses , Judas , and Simon ? And aren’t his sisters here with us ? ” And so they took offense at him .
41006004	Then Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown , and among his relatives , and in his own house . ”
41006005	He was not able to do a miracle there , except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them .
41006006	And he was amazed because of their unbelief . Then he went around among the villages and taught .
41006007	Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two . He gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
41006008	He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff – no bread , no bag , no money in their belts –
41006009	and to put on sandals but not to wear two tunics .
41006010	He said to them , “ Wherever you enter a house , stay there until you leave the area .
41006011	If a place will not welcome you or listen to you , as you go out from there , shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them . ”
41006012	So they went out and preached that all should repent .
41006013	They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them .
41006014	Now King Herod heard this , for Jesus’ name had become known . Some were saying , “ John the baptizer has been raised from the dead , and because of this , miraculous powers are at work in him . ”
41006015	Others said , “ He is Elijah . ” Others said , “ He is a prophet , like one of the prophets from the past . ”
41006016	But when Herod heard this , he said , “ John , whom I beheaded , has been raised ! ”
41006017	For Herod himself had sent men , arrested John , and bound him in prison on account of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife , because Herod had married her .
41006018	For John had repeatedly told Herod , “ It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife . ”
41006019	So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him . But she could not
41006020	because Herod stood in awe of John and protected him , since he knew that John was a righteous and holy man . When Herod heard him , he was thoroughly baffled , and yet he liked to listen to John .
41006021	But a suitable day came , when Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his court officials , military commanders , and leaders of Galilee .
41006022	When his daughter Herodias came in and danced , she pleased Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you . ”
41006023	He swore to her , “ Whatever you ask I will give you , up to half my kingdom . ”
41006024	So she went out and said to her mother , “ What should I ask for ? ” Her mother said , “ The head of John the baptizer . ”
41006025	Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request : “ I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately . ”
41006026	Although it grieved the king deeply , he did not want to reject her request because of his oath and his guests .
41006027	So the king sent an executioner at once to bring John’s head , and he went and beheaded John in prison .
41006028	He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	When John’s disciples heard this , they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb .
41006030	Then the apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught .
41006031	He said to them , “ Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while ” ( for many were coming and going , and there was no time to eat ) .
41006032	So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place .
41006033	But many saw them leaving and recognized them , and they hurried on foot from all the towns and arrived there ahead of them .
41006034	As Jesus came ashore he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he taught them many things .
41006035	When it was already late , his disciples came to him and said , “ This is an isolated place and it is already very late .
41006036	Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat . ”
41006037	But he answered them , “ You give them something to eat . ” And they said , “ Should we go and buy bread for two hundred silver coins and give it to them to eat ? ”
41006038	He said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . ” When they found out , they said , “ Five – and two fish . ”
41006039	Then he directed them all to sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties .
41006041	He took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke the loaves . He gave them to his disciples to serve the people , and he divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	They all ate and were satisfied ,
41006043	and they picked up the broken pieces and fish that were left over , twelve baskets full .
41006044	Now there were five thousand men who ate the bread .
41006045	Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he dispersed the crowd .
41006046	After saying good-bye to them , he went to the mountain to pray .
41006047	When evening came , the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land .
41006048	He saw them straining at the oars , because the wind was against them . As the night was ending , he came to them walking on the sea , for he wanted to pass by them .
41006049	When they saw him walking on the water they thought he was a ghost . They cried out ,
41006050	for they all saw him and were terrified . But immediately he spoke to them : “ Have courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
41006051	Then he went up with them into the boat , and the wind ceased . They were completely astonished ,
41006052	because they did not understand about the loaves , but their hearts were hardened .
41006053	After they had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there .
41006054	As they got out of the boat , people immediately recognized Jesus .
41006055	They ran through that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever he was rumored to be .
41006056	And wherever he would go – into villages , towns , or countryside – they would place the sick in the marketplaces , and would ask him if they could just touch the edge of his cloak , and all who touched it were healed .
41007001	Now the Pharisees and some of the experts in the law who came from Jerusalem gathered around him .
41007002	And they saw that some of Jesus’ disciples ate their bread with unclean hands , that is , unwashed .
41007003	( For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing , holding fast to the tradition of the elders .
41007004	And when they come from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they wash . They hold fast to many other traditions : the washing of cups , pots , kettles , and dining couches . )
41007005	The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him , “ Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders , but eat with unwashed hands ? ”
41007006	He said to them , “ Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites , as it is written : ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
41007007	They worship me in vain , teaching as doctrine the commandments of men . ’
41007008	Having no regard for the command of God , you hold fast to human tradition . ”
41007009	He also said to them , “ You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition .
41007010	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and , ‘ Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death . ’
41007011	But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother , ‘ Whatever help you would have received from me is corban ’ ( that is , a gift for God ) ,
41007012	then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother .
41007013	Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down . And you do many things like this . ”
41007014	Then he called the crowd again and said to them , “ Listen to me , everyone , and understand .
41007015	There is nothing outside of a person that can defile him by going into him . Rather , it is what comes out of a person that defiles him . ”
41007017	Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house , his disciples asked him about the parable .
41007018	He said to them , “ Are you so foolish ? Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him ?
41007019	For it does not enter his heart but his stomach , and then goes out into the sewer . ” ( This means all foods are clean . )
41007020	He said , “ What comes out of a person defiles him .
41007021	For from within , out of the human heart , come evil ideas , sexual immorality , theft , murder ,
41007022	adultery , greed , evil , deceit , debauchery , envy , slander , pride , and folly .
41007023	All these evils come from within and defile a person . ”
41007024	After Jesus left there , he went to the region of Tyre . When he went into a house , he did not want anyone to know , but he was not able to escape notice .
41007025	Instead , a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet .
41007026	The woman was a Greek , of Syrophoenician origin . She asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	He said to her , “ Let the children be satisfied first , for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the dogs . ”
41007028	She answered , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs . ”
41007029	Then he said to her , “ Because you said this , you may go . The demon has left your daughter . ”
41007030	She went home and found the child lying on the bed , and the demon gone .
41007031	Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis .
41007032	They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking , and they asked him to place his hands on him .
41007033	After Jesus took him aside privately , away from the crowd , he put his fingers in the man’s ears , and after spitting , he touched his tongue .
41007034	Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh , “ Ephphatha ” ( that is , “ Be opened ” ) .
41007035	And immediately the man’s ears were opened , his tongue loosened , and he spoke plainly .
41007036	Jesus ordered them not to tell anything . But as much as he ordered them not to do this , they proclaimed it all the more .
41007037	People were completely astounded and said , “ He has done everything well . He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak . ”
41008001	In those days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat . So Jesus called his disciples and said to them ,
41008002	“ I have compassion on the crowd , because they have already been here with me three days , and they have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them home hungry , they will faint on the way , and some of them have come from a great distance . ”
41008004	His disciples answered him , “ Where can someone get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy these people ? ”
41008005	He asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” They replied , “ Seven . ”
41008006	Then he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground . After he took the seven loaves and gave thanks , he broke them and began giving them to the disciples to serve . So they served the crowd .
41008007	They also had a few small fish . After giving thanks for these , he told them to serve these as well .
41008008	Everyone ate and was satisfied , and they picked up the broken pieces left over , seven baskets full .
41008009	There were about four thousand who ate . Then he dismissed them .
41008010	Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha .
41008011	Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus , asking for a sign from heaven to test him .
41008012	Sighing deeply in his spirit he said , “ Why does this generation look for a sign ? I tell you the truth , no sign will be given to this generation . ”
41008013	Then he left them , got back into the boat , and went to the other side .
41008014	Now they had forgotten to take bread , except for one loaf they had with them in the boat .
41008015	And Jesus ordered them , “ Watch out ! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod ! ”
41008016	So they began to discuss with one another about having no bread .
41008017	When he learned of this , Jesus said to them , “ Why are you arguing about having no bread ? Do you still not see or understand ? Have your hearts been hardened ?
41008018	Though you have eyes , don’t you see ? And though you have ears , can’t you hear ? Don’t you remember ?
41008019	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up ? ” They replied , “ Twelve . ”
41008020	“ When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand , how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up ? ” They replied , “ Seven . ”
41008021	Then he said to them , “ Do you still not understand ? ”
41008022	Then they came to Bethsaida . They brought a blind man to Jesus and asked him to touch him .
41008023	He took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside of the village . Then he spit on his eyes , placed his hands on his eyes and asked , “ Do you see anything ? ”
41008024	Regaining his sight he said , “ I see people , but they look like trees walking . ”
41008025	Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again . And he opened his eyes , his sight was restored , and he saw everything clearly .
41008026	Jesus sent him home , saying , “ Do not even go into the village . ”
41008027	Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
41008028	They said , “ John the Baptist , others say Elijah , and still others , one of the prophets . ”
41008029	He asked them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered him , “ You are the Christ . ”
41008030	Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him .
41008031	Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and experts in the law , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
41008032	He spoke openly about this . So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
41008033	But after turning and looking at his disciples , he rebuked Peter and said , “ Get behind me , Satan . You are not setting your mind on God’s interests , but on man’s . ”
41008034	Then Jesus called the crowd , along with his disciples , and said to them , “ If anyone wants to become my follower , he must deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
41008035	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it .
41008036	For what benefit is it for a person to gain the whole world , yet forfeit his life ?
41008037	What can a person give in exchange for his life ?
41008038	For if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . ”
41009001	And he said to them , “ I tell you the truth , there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God come with power . ”
41009002	Six days later Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John and led them alone up a high mountain privately . And he was transfigured before them ,
41009003	and his clothes became radiantly white , more so than any launderer in the world could bleach them .
41009004	Then Elijah appeared before them along with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
41009005	So Peter said to Jesus , “ Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . Let us make three shelters – one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41009006	( For they were afraid , and he did not know what to say . )
41009007	Then a cloud overshadowed them , and a voice came from the cloud , “ This is my one dear Son . Listen to him ! ”
41009008	Suddenly when they looked around , they saw no one with them any more except Jesus .
41009009	As they were coming down from the mountain , he gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41009010	They kept this statement to themselves , discussing what this rising from the dead meant .
41009011	Then they asked him , “ Why do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first ? ”
41009012	He said to them , “ Elijah does indeed come first , and restores all things . And why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be despised ?
41009013	But I tell you that Elijah has certainly come , and they did to him whatever they wanted , just as it is written about him . ”
41009014	When they came to the disciples , they saw a large crowd around them and experts in the law arguing with them .
41009015	When the whole crowd saw him , they were amazed and ran at once and greeted him .
41009016	He asked them , “ What are you arguing about with them ? ”
41009017	A member of the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , I brought you my son , who is possessed by a spirit that makes him mute .
41009018	Whenever it seizes him , it throws him down , and he foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes rigid . I asked your disciples to cast it out , but they were not able to do so . ”
41009019	He answered them , “ You unbelieving generation ! How much longer must I be with you ? How much longer must I endure you ? Bring him to me . ”
41009020	So they brought the boy to him . When the spirit saw him , it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion . He fell on the ground and rolled around , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked his father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” And he said , “ From childhood .
41009022	It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him . But if you are able to do anything , have compassion on us and help us . ”
41009023	Then Jesus said to him , “ ‘ If you are able ? ’ All things are possible for the one who believes . ”
41009024	Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said , “ I believe ; help my unbelief ! ”
41009025	Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , “ Mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him and never enter him again . ”
41009026	It shrieked , threw him into terrible convulsions , and came out . The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said , “ He is dead ! ”
41009027	But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet , and he stood up .
41009028	Then , after he went into the house , his disciples asked him privately , “ Why couldn’t we cast it out ? ”
41009029	He told them , “ This kind can come out only by prayer . ”
41009030	They went out from there and passed through Galilee . But Jesus did not want anyone to know ,
41009031	for he was teaching his disciples and telling them , “ The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men . They will kill him , and after three days he will rise . ”
41009032	But they did not understand this statement and were afraid to ask him .
41009033	Then they came to Capernaum . After Jesus was inside the house he asked them , “ What were you discussing on the way ? ”
41009034	But they were silent , for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest .
41009035	After he sat down , he called the twelve and said to them , “ If anyone wants to be first , he must be last of all and servant of all . ”
41009036	He took a little child and had him stand among them . Taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
41009037	“ Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me , and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me . ”
41009038	John said to him , “ Teacher , we saw someone casting out demons in your name , and we tried to stop him because he was not following us . ”
41009039	But Jesus said , “ Do not stop him , because no one who does a miracle in my name will be able soon afterward to say anything bad about me .
41009040	For whoever is not against us is for us .
41009041	For I tell you the truth , whoever gives you a cup of water because you bear Christ’s name will never lose his reward .
41009042	“ If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a huge millstone tied around his neck and to be thrown into the sea .
41009043	If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off ! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than to have two hands and go into hell , to the unquenchable fire .
41009045	If your foot causes you to sin , cut it off ! It is better to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell .
41009047	If your eye causes you to sin , tear it out ! It is better to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell ,
41009048	where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched .
41009049	Everyone will be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good , but if it loses its saltiness , how can you make it salty again ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with each other . ”
41010001	Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan River . Again crowds gathered to him , and again , as was his custom , he taught them .
41010002	Then some Pharisees came , and to test him they asked , “ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? ”
41010003	He answered them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
41010004	They said , “ Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her . ”
41010005	But Jesus said to them , “ He wrote this commandment for you because of your hard hearts .
41010006	But from the beginning of creation he made them male and female .
41010007	For this reason a man will leave his father and mother ,
41010008	and the two will become one flesh . So they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	Therefore what God has joined together , let no one separate . ”
41010010	In the house once again , the disciples asked him about this .
41010011	So he told them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
41010012	And if she divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery . ”
41010013	Now people were bringing little children to him for him to touch , but the disciples scolded those who brought them .
41010014	But when Jesus saw this , he was indignant and said to them , “ Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
41010015	I tell you the truth , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it . ”
41010016	After he took the children in his arms , he placed his hands on them and blessed them .
41010017	Now as Jesus was starting out on his way , someone ran up to him , fell on his knees , and said , “ Good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
41010018	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
41010019	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not murder , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not give false testimony , do not defraud , honor your father and mother . ’ ”
41010020	The man said to him , “ Teacher , I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth . ”
41010021	As Jesus looked at him , he felt love for him and said , “ You lack one thing . Go , sell whatever you have and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me . ”
41010022	But at this statement , the man looked sad and went away sorrowful , for he was very rich .
41010023	Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , “ How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
41010024	The disciples were astonished at these words . But again Jesus said to them , “ Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
41010026	They were even more astonished and said to one another , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
41010027	Jesus looked at them and replied , “ This is impossible for mere humans , but not for God ; all things are possible for God . ”
41010028	Peter began to speak to him , “ Look , we have left everything to follow you ! ”
41010029	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , there is no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the gospel
41010030	who will not receive in this age a hundred times as much – homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , fields , all with persecutions – and in the age to come , eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first will be last , and the last first . ”
41010032	They were on the way , going up to Jerusalem . Jesus was going ahead of them , and they were amazed , but those who followed were afraid . He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was going to happen to him .
41010033	“ Look , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and experts in the law . They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles .
41010034	They will mock him , spit on him , flog him severely , and kill him . Yet after three days , he will rise again . ”
41010035	Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to him and said , “ Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask . ”
41010036	He said to them , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
41010037	They said to him , “ Permit one of us to sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your glory . ”
41010038	But Jesus said to them , “ You don’t know what you are asking ! Are you able to drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I experience ? ”
41010039	They said to him , “ We are able . ” Then Jesus said to them , “ You will drink the cup I drink , and you will be baptized with the baptism I experience ,
41010040	but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give . It is for those for whom it has been prepared . ”
41010041	Now when the other ten heard this , they became angry with James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them and said to them , “ You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and those in high positions use their authority over them .
41010043	But it is not this way among you . Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant ,
41010044	and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . ”
41010046	They came to Jericho . As Jesus and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho , Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the road .
41010047	When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to shout , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010048	Many scolded him to get him to be quiet , but he shouted all the more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him . ” So they called the blind man and said to him , “ Have courage ! Get up ! He is calling you . ”
41010050	He threw off his cloak , jumped up , and came to Jesus .
41010051	Then Jesus said to him , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man replied , “ Rabbi , let me see again . ”
41010052	Jesus said to him , “ Go , your faith has healed you . ” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the road .
41011001	Now as they approached Jerusalem , near Bethphage and Bethany , at the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two of his disciples
41011002	and said to them , “ Go to the village ahead of you . As soon as you enter it , you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
41011003	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Lord needs it and will send it back here soon . ’ ”
41011004	So they went and found a colt tied at a door , outside in the street , and untied it .
41011005	Some people standing there said to them , “ What are you doing , untying that colt ? ”
41011006	They replied as Jesus had told them , and the bystanders let them go .
41011007	Then they brought the colt to Jesus , threw their cloaks on it , and he sat on it .
41011008	Many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread branches they had cut in the fields .
41011009	Both those who went ahead and those who followed kept shouting , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
41011011	Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple . And after looking around at everything , he went out to Bethany with the twelve since it was already late .
41011012	Now the next day , as they went out from Bethany , he was hungry .
41011013	After noticing in the distance a fig tree with leaves , he went to see if he could find any fruit on it . When he came to it he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
41011014	He said to it , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again . ” And his disciples heard it .
41011015	Then they came to Jerusalem . Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were selling and buying in the temple courts . He turned over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves ,
41011016	and he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts .
41011017	Then he began to teach them and said , “ Is it not written : ‘ My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations ’ ? But you have turned it into a den of robbers ! ”
41011018	The chief priests and the experts in the law heard it and they considered how they could assassinate him , for they feared him , because the whole crowd was amazed by his teaching .
41011019	When evening came , Jesus and his disciples went out of the city .
41011020	In the morning as they passed by , they saw the fig tree withered from the roots .
41011021	Peter remembered and said to him , “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree you cursed has withered . ”
41011022	Jesus said to them , “ Have faith in God .
41011023	I tell you the truth , if someone says to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen , it will be done for him .
41011024	For this reason I tell you , whatever you pray and ask for , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
41011025	Whenever you stand praying , if you have anything against anyone , forgive him , so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you your sins . ”
41011027	They came again to Jerusalem . While Jesus was walking in the temple courts , the chief priests , the experts in the law , and the elders came up to him
41011028	and said , “ By what authority are you doing these things ? Or who gave you this authority to do these things ? ”
41011029	Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one question . Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things :
41011030	John’s baptism – was it from heaven or from people ? Answer me . ”
41011031	They discussed with one another , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
41011032	But if we say , ‘ From people – ’ ” ( they feared the crowd , for they all considered John to be truly a prophet ) .
41011033	So they answered Jesus , “ We don’t know . ” Then Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things . ”
41012001	Then he began to speak to them in parables : “ A man planted a vineyard . He put a fence around it , dug a pit for its winepress , and built a watchtower . Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey .
41012002	At harvest time he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his portion of the crop .
41012003	But those tenants seized his slave , beat him , and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	So he sent another slave to them again . This one they struck on the head and treated outrageously .
41012005	He sent another , and that one they killed . This happened to many others , some of whom were beaten , others killed .
41012006	He had one left , his one dear son . Finally he sent him to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son . ’
41012007	But those tenants said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let’s kill him and the inheritance will be ours ! ’
41012008	So they seized him , killed him , and threw his body out of the vineyard .
41012009	What then will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Have you not read this scripture : ‘ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone .
41012011	This is from the Lord , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ? ”
41012012	Now they wanted to arrest him ( but they feared the crowd ) , because they realized that he told this parable against them . So they left him and went away .
41012013	Then they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to trap him with his own words .
41012014	When they came they said to him , “ Teacher , we know that you are truthful and do not court anyone’s favor , because you show no partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? Should we pay or shouldn’t we ? ”
41012015	But he saw through their hypocrisy and said to them , “ Why are you testing me ? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it . ”
41012016	So they brought one , and he said to them , “ Whose image is this , and whose inscription ? ” They replied , “ Caesar’s . ”
41012017	Then Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ” And they were utterly amazed at him .
41012018	Sadducees ( who say there is no resurrection ) also came to him and asked him ,
41012019	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us : ‘ If a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , that man must marry the widow and father children for his brother . ’
41012020	There were seven brothers . The first one married , and when he died he had no children .
41012021	The second married her and died without any children , and likewise the third .
41012022	None of the seven had children . Finally , the woman died too .
41012023	In the resurrection , when they rise again , whose wife will she be ? For all seven had married her . ”
41012024	Jesus said to them , “ Aren’t you deceived for this reason , because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God ?
41012025	For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
41012026	Now as for the dead being raised , have you not read in the book of Moses , in the passage about the bush , how God said to him , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ?
41012027	He is not the God of the dead but of the living . You are badly mistaken ! ”
41012028	Now one of the experts in the law came and heard them debating . When he saw that Jesus answered them well , he asked him , “ Which commandment is the most important of all ? ”
41012029	Jesus answered , “ The most important is : ‘ Listen , Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is one .
41012030	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your mind , and with all your strength . ’
41012031	The second is : ‘ Love your neighbor as yourself . ’ There is no other commandment greater than these . ”
41012032	The expert in the law said to him , “ That is true , Teacher ; you are right to say that he is one , and there is no one else besides him .
41012033	And to love him with all your heart , with all your mind , and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices . ”
41012034	When Jesus saw that he had answered thoughtfully , he said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God . ” Then no one dared any longer to question him .
41012035	While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts , he said , “ How is it that the experts in the law say that the Christ is David’s son ?
41012036	David himself , by the Holy Spirit , said , ‘ The Lord said to my lord , “ Sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies under your feet . ” ’
41012037	If David himself calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how can he be his son ? ” And the large crowd was listening to him with delight .
41012038	In his teaching Jesus also said , “ Watch out for the experts in the law . They like walking around in long robes and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces ,
41012039	and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
41012040	They devour widows’ property , and as a show make long prayers . These men will receive a more severe punishment . ”
41012041	Then he sat down opposite the offering box , and watched the crowd putting coins into it . Many rich people were throwing in large amounts .
41012042	And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins , worth less than a penny .
41012043	He called his disciples and said to them , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow has put more into the offering box than all the others .
41012044	For they all gave out of their wealth . But she , out of her poverty , put in what she had to live on , everything she had . ”
41013001	Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts , one of his disciples said to him , “ Teacher , look at these tremendous stones and buildings ! ”
41013002	Jesus said to him , “ Do you see these great buildings ? Not one stone will be left on another . All will be torn down ! ”
41013003	So while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter , James , John , and Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	“ Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that all these things are about to take place ? ”
41013005	Jesus began to say to them , “ Watch out that no one misleads you .
41013006	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and they will mislead many .
41013007	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed . These things must happen , but the end is still to come .
41013008	For nation will rise up in arms against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places , and there will be famines . These are but the beginning of birth pains .
41013009	“ You must watch out for yourselves . You will be handed over to councils and beaten in the synagogues . You will stand before governors and kings because of me , as a witness to them .
41013010	First the gospel must be preached to all nations .
41013011	When they arrest you and hand you over for trial , do not worry about what to speak . But say whatever is given you at that time , for it is not you speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	Brother will hand over brother to death , and a father his child . Children will rise against parents and have them put to death .
41013013	You will be hated by everyone because of my name . But the one who endures to the end will be saved .
41013014	“ But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be ( let the reader understand ) , then those in Judea must flee to the mountains .
41013015	The one on the roof must not come down or go inside to take anything out of his house .
41013016	The one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak .
41013017	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days !
41013018	Pray that it may not be in winter .
41013019	For in those days there will be suffering unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now , or ever will happen .
41013020	And if the Lord had not cut short those days , no one would be saved . But because of the elect , whom he chose , he has cut them short .
41013021	Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ do not believe him .
41013022	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , the elect .
41013023	Be careful ! I have told you everything ahead of time .
41013024	“ But in those days , after that suffering , the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light ;
41013025	the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
41013026	Then everyone will see the Son of Man arriving in the clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	Then he will send angels and they will gather his elect from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven .
41013028	“ Learn this parable from the fig tree : Whenever its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves , you know that summer is near .
41013029	So also you , when you see these things happening , know that he is near , right at the door .
41013030	I tell you the truth , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
41013032	“ But as for that day or hour no one knows it – neither the angels in heaven , nor the Son – except the Father .
41013033	Watch out ! Stay alert ! For you do not know when the time will come .
41013034	It is like a man going on a journey . He left his house and put his slaves in charge , assigning to each his work , and commanded the doorkeeper to stay alert .
41013035	Stay alert , then , because you do not know when the owner of the house will return – whether during evening , at midnight , when the rooster crows , or at dawn –
41013036	or else he might find you asleep when he returns suddenly .
41013037	What I say to you I say to everyone : Stay alert ! ”
41014001	Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him .
41014002	For they said , “ Not during the feast , so there won’t be a riot among the people . ”
41014003	Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper , reclining at the table , a woman came with an alabaster jar of costly aromatic oil from pure nard . After breaking open the jar , she poured it on his head .
41014004	But some who were present indignantly said to one another , “ Why this waste of expensive ointment ?
41014005	It could have been sold for more than three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor ! ” So they spoke angrily to her .
41014006	But Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . Why are you bothering her ? She has done a good service for me .
41014007	For you will always have the poor with you , and you can do good for them whenever you want . But you will not always have me !
41014008	She did what she could . She anointed my body beforehand for burial .
41014009	I tell you the truth , wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world , what she has done will also be told in memory of her . ”
41014010	Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went to the chief priests to betray Jesus into their hands .
41014011	When they heard this , they were delighted and promised to give him money . So Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray him .
41014012	Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread , when the Passover lamb is sacrificed , Jesus’ disciples said to him , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? ”
41014013	He sent two of his disciples and told them , “ Go into the city , and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him .
41014014	Wherever he enters , tell the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says , “ Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ” ’
41014015	He will show you a large room upstairs , furnished and ready . Make preparations for us there . ”
41014016	So the disciples left , went into the city , and found things just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
41014017	Then , when it was evening , he came to the house with the twelve .
41014018	While they were at the table eating , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , one of you eating with me will betray me . ”
41014019	They were distressed , and one by one said to him , “ Surely not I ? ”
41014020	He said to them , “ It is one of the twelve , one who dips his hand with me into the bowl .
41014021	For the Son of Man will go as it is written about him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would be better for him if he had never been born . ”
41014022	While they were eating , he took bread , and after giving thanks he broke it , gave it to them , and said , “ Take it . This is my body . ”
41014023	And after taking the cup and giving thanks , he gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
41014024	He said to them , “ This is my blood , the blood of the covenant , that is poured out for many .
41014025	I tell you the truth , I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God . ”
41014026	After singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	Then Jesus said to them , “ You will all fall away , for it is written , ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ’
41014028	But after I am raised , I will go ahead of you into Galilee . ”
41014029	Peter said to him , “ Even if they all fall away , I will not ! ”
41014030	Jesus said to him , “ I tell you the truth , today – this very night – before a rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . ”
41014031	But Peter insisted emphatically , “ Even if I must die with you , I will never deny you . ” And all of them said the same thing .
41014032	Then they went to a place called Gethsemane , and Jesus said to his disciples , “ Sit here while I pray . ”
41014033	He took Peter , James , and John with him , and became very troubled and distressed .
41014034	He said to them , “ My soul is deeply grieved , even to the point of death . Remain here and stay alert . ”
41014035	Going a little farther , he threw himself to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour would pass from him .
41014036	He said , “ Abba , Father , all things are possible for you . Take this cup away from me . Yet not what I will , but what you will . ”
41014037	Then he came and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , “ Simon , are you sleeping ? Couldn’t you stay awake for one hour ?
41014038	Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
41014039	He went away again and prayed the same thing .
41014040	When he came again he found them sleeping ; they could not keep their eyes open . And they did not know what to tell him .
41014041	He came a third time and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough of that ! The hour has come . Look , the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Get up , let us go . Look ! My betrayer is approaching ! ”
41014043	Right away , while Jesus was still speaking , Judas , one of the twelve , arrived . With him came a crowd armed with swords and clubs , sent by the chief priests and experts in the law and elders .
41014044	( Now the betrayer had given them a sign , saying , “ The one I kiss is the man . Arrest him and lead him away under guard . ” )
41014045	When Judas arrived , he went up to Jesus immediately and said , “ Rabbi ! ” and kissed him .
41014046	Then they took hold of him and arrested him .
41014047	One of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the high priest’s slave , cutting off his ear .
41014048	Jesus said to them , “ Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw ?
41014049	Day after day I was with you , teaching in the temple courts , yet you did not arrest me . But this has happened so that the scriptures would be fulfilled . ”
41014050	Then all the disciples left him and fled .
41014051	A young man was following him , wearing only a linen cloth . They tried to arrest him ,
41014052	but he ran off naked , leaving his linen cloth behind .
41014053	Then they led Jesus to the high priest , and all the chief priests and elders and experts in the law came together .
41014054	And Peter had followed him from a distance , up to the high priest’s courtyard . He was sitting with the guards and warming himself by the fire .
41014055	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death , but they did not find anything .
41014056	Many gave false testimony against him , but their testimony did not agree .
41014057	Some stood up and gave this false testimony against him :
41014058	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days build another not made with hands . ’ ”
41014059	Yet even on this point their testimony did not agree .
41014060	Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus , “ Have you no answer ? What is this that they are testifying against you ? ”
41014061	But he was silent and did not answer . Again the high priest questioned him , “ Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed One ? ”
41014062	“ I am , ” said Jesus , “ and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven . ”
41014063	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , “ Why do we still need witnesses ?
41014064	You have heard the blasphemy ! What is your verdict ? ” They all condemned him as deserving death .
41014065	Then some began to spit on him , and to blindfold him , and to strike him with their fists , saying , “ Prophesy ! ” The guards also took him and beat him .
41014066	Now while Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the high priest’s slave girls came by .
41014067	When she saw Peter warming himself , she looked directly at him and said , “ You also were with that Nazarene , Jesus . ”
41014068	But he denied it : “ I don’t even understand what you’re talking about ! ” Then he went out to the gateway , and a rooster crowed .
41014069	When the slave girl saw him , she began again to say to the bystanders , “ This man is one of them . ”
41014070	But he denied it again . A short time later the bystanders again said to Peter , “ You must be one of them , because you are also a Galilean . ”
41014071	Then he began to curse , and he swore with an oath , “ I do not know this man you are talking about ! ”
41014072	Immediately a rooster crowed a second time . Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him : “ Before a rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times . ” And he broke down and wept .
41015001	Early in the morning , after forming a plan , the chief priests with the elders and the experts in the law and the whole Sanhedrin tied Jesus up , led him away , and handed him over to Pilate .
41015002	So Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” He replied , “ You say so . ”
41015003	Then the chief priests began to accuse him repeatedly .
41015004	So Pilate asked him again , “ Have you nothing to say ? See how many charges they are bringing against you ! ”
41015005	But Jesus made no further reply , so that Pilate was amazed .
41015006	During the feast it was customary to release one prisoner to the people , whomever they requested .
41015007	A man named Barabbas was imprisoned with rebels who had committed murder during an insurrection .
41015008	Then the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to release a prisoner for them , as was his custom .
41015009	So Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you ? ”
41015010	( For he knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy . )
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas instead .
41015012	So Pilate spoke to them again , “ Then what do you want me to do with the one you call king of the Jews ? ”
41015013	They shouted back , “ Crucify him ! ”
41015014	Pilate asked them , “ Why ? What has he done wrong ? ” But they shouted more insistently , “ Crucify him ! ”
41015015	Because he wanted to satisfy the crowd , Pilate released Barabbas for them . Then , after he had Jesus flogged , he handed him over to be crucified .
41015016	So the soldiers led him into the palace ( that is , the governor’s residence ) and called together the whole cohort .
41015017	They put a purple cloak on him and after braiding a crown of thorns , they put it on him .
41015018	They began to salute him : “ Hail , king of the Jews ! ”
41015019	Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him . Then they knelt down and paid homage to him .
41015020	When they had finished mocking him , they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes back on him . Then they led him away to crucify him .
41015021	The soldiers forced a passerby to carry his cross , Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country ( he was the father of Alexander and Rufus ) .
41015022	They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha ( which is translated , “ Place of the Skull ” ) .
41015023	They offered him wine mixed with myrrh , but he did not take it .
41015024	Then they crucified him and divided his clothes , throwing dice for them , to decide what each would take .
41015025	It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him .
41015026	The inscription of the charge against him read , “ The king of the Jews . ”
41015027	And they crucified two outlaws with him , one on his right and one on his left .
41015029	Those who passed by defamed him , shaking their heads and saying , “ Aha ! You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days ,
41015030	save yourself and come down from the cross ! ”
41015031	In the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law – were mocking him among themselves : “ He saved others , but he cannot save himself !
41015032	Let the Christ , the king of Israel , come down from the cross now , that we may see and believe ! ” Those who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him .
41015033	Now when it was noon , darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon .
41015034	Around three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice , “ Eloi , Eloi , lema sabachthani ? ” which means , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
41015035	When some of the bystanders heard it they said , “ Listen , he is calling for Elijah ! ”
41015036	Then someone ran , filled a sponge with sour wine , put it on a stick , and gave it to him to drink , saying , “ Leave him alone ! Let’s see if Elijah will come to take him down ! ”
41015037	But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last .
41015038	And the temple curtain was torn in two , from top to bottom .
41015039	Now when the centurion , who stood in front of him , saw how he died , he said , “ Truly this man was God’s Son ! ”
41015040	There were also women , watching from a distance . Among them were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses , and Salome .
41015041	When he was in Galilee , they had followed him and given him support . Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were there too .
41015042	Now when evening had already come , since it was the day of preparation ( that is , the day before the Sabbath ) ,
41015043	Joseph of Arimathea , a highly regarded member of the council , who was himself looking forward to the kingdom of God , went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
41015044	Pilate was surprised that he was already dead . He called the centurion and asked him if he had been dead for some time .
41015045	When Pilate was informed by the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
41015046	After Joseph bought a linen cloth and took down the body , he wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock . Then he rolled a stone across the entrance of the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was placed .
41016001	When the Sabbath was over , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought aromatic spices so that they might go and anoint him .
41016002	And very early on the first day of the week , at sunrise , they went to the tomb .
41016003	They had been asking each other , “ Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb ? ”
41016004	But when they looked up , they saw that the stone , which was very large , had been rolled back .
41016005	Then as they went into the tomb , they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side ; and they were alarmed .
41016006	But he said to them , “ Do not be alarmed . You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene , who was crucified . He has been raised ! He is not here . Look , there is the place where they laid him .
41016007	But go , tell his disciples , even Peter , that he is going ahead of you into Galilee . You will see him there , just as he told you . ”
41016008	Then they went out and ran from the tomb , for terror and bewilderment had seized them . And they said nothing to anyone , because they were afraid . [ [
41016009	Early on the first day of the week , after he arose , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had driven out seven demons .
41016010	She went out and told those who were with him , while they were mourning and weeping .
41016011	And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her , they did not believe .
41016012	After this he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were on their way to the country .
41016013	They went back and told the rest , but they did not believe them .
41016014	Then he appeared to the eleven themselves , while they were eating , and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected .
41016015	He said to them , “ Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature .
41016016	The one who believes and is baptized will be saved , but the one who does not believe will be condemned .
41016017	These signs will accompany those who believe : In my name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new languages ;
41016018	they will pick up snakes with their hands , and whatever poison they drink will not harm them ; they will place their hands on the sick and they will be well . ”
41016019	After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them , he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	They went out and proclaimed everywhere , while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs . ] ]
42001001	Now many have undertaken to compile an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us ,
42001002	like the accounts passed on to us by those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning .
42001003	So it seemed good to me as well , because I have followed all things carefully from the beginning , to write an orderly account for you , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	so that you may know for certain the things you were taught .
42001005	During the reign of Herod king of Judea , there lived a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah , and he had a wife named Elizabeth , who was a descendant of Aaron .
42001006	They were both righteous in the sight of God , following all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly .
42001007	But they did not have a child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they were both very old .
42001008	Now while Zechariah was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty ,
42001009	he was chosen by lot , according to the custom of the priesthood , to enter the holy place of the Lord and burn incense .
42001010	Now the whole crowd of people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering .
42001011	An angel of the Lord , standing on the right side of the altar of incense , appeared to him .
42001012	And Zechariah , visibly shaken when he saw the angel , was seized with fear .
42001013	But the angel said to him , “ Do not be afraid , Zechariah , for your prayer has been heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son ; you will name him John .
42001014	Joy and gladness will come to you , and many will rejoice at his birth ,
42001015	for he will be great in the sight of the Lord . He must never drink wine or strong drink , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit , even before his birth .
42001016	He will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God .
42001017	And he will go as forerunner before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers back to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just , to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him . ”
42001018	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How can I be sure of this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is old as well . ”
42001019	The angel answered him , “ I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God , and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news .
42001020	And now , because you did not believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their time , you will be silent , unable to speak , until the day these things take place . ”
42001021	Now the people were waiting for Zechariah , and they began to wonder why he was delayed in the holy place .
42001022	When he came out , he was not able to speak to them . They realized that he had seen a vision in the holy place , because he was making signs to them and remained unable to speak .
42001023	When his time of service was over , he went to his home .
42001024	After some time his wife Elizabeth became pregnant , and for five months she kept herself in seclusion . She said ,
42001025	“ This is what the Lord has done for me at the time when he has been gracious to me , to take away my disgrace among people . ”
42001026	In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy , the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth ,
42001027	to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph , a descendant of David , and the virgin’s name was Mary .
42001028	The angel came to her and said , “ Greetings , favored one , the Lord is with you ! ”
42001029	But she was greatly troubled by his words and began to wonder about the meaning of this greeting .
42001030	So the angel said to her , “ Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God !
42001031	Listen : You will become pregnant and give birth to a son , and you will name him Jesus .
42001032	He will be great , and will be called the Son of the Most High , and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David .
42001033	He will reign over the house of Jacob forever , and his kingdom will never end . ”
42001034	Mary said to the angel , “ How will this be , since I have not had sexual relations with a man ? ”
42001035	The angel replied , “ The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . Therefore the child to be born will be holy ; he will be called the Son of God .
42001036	“ And look , your relative Elizabeth has also become pregnant with a son in her old age – although she was called barren , she is now in her sixth month !
42001037	For nothing will be impossible with God . ”
42001038	So Mary said , “ Yes , I am a servant of the Lord ; let this happen to me according to your word . ” Then the angel departed from her .
42001039	In those days Mary got up and went hurriedly into the hill country , to a town of Judah ,
42001040	and entered Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
42001042	She exclaimed with a loud voice , “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the child in your womb !
42001043	And who am I that the mother of my Lord should come and visit me ?
42001044	For the instant the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy .
42001045	And blessed is she who believed that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled . ”
42001046	And Mary said , “ My soul exalts the Lord ,
42001047	and my spirit has begun to rejoice in God my Savior ,
42001048	because he has looked upon the humble state of his servant . For from now on all generations will call me blessed ,
42001049	because he who is mighty has done great things for me , and holy is his name ;
42001050	from generation to generation he is merciful to those who fear him .
42001051	He has demonstrated power with his arm ; he has scattered those whose pride wells up from the sheer arrogance of their hearts .
42001052	He has brought down the mighty from their thrones , and has lifted up those of lowly position ;
42001053	he has filled the hungry with good things , and has sent the rich away empty .
42001054	He has helped his servant Israel , remembering his mercy ,
42001055	as he promised to our ancestors , to Abraham and to his descendants forever . ”
42001056	So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned to her home .
42001057	Now the time came for Elizabeth to have her baby , and she gave birth to a son .
42001058	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her , and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they wanted to name him Zechariah after his father .
42001060	But his mother replied , “ No ! He must be named John . ”
42001061	They said to her , “ But none of your relatives bears this name . ”
42001062	So they made signs to the baby’s father , inquiring what he wanted to name his son .
42001063	He asked for a writing tablet and wrote , “ His name is John . ” And they were all amazed .
42001064	Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue released , and he spoke , blessing God .
42001065	All their neighbors were filled with fear , and throughout the entire hill country of Judea all these things were talked about .
42001066	All who heard these things kept them in their hearts , saying , “ What then will this child be ? ” For the Lord’s hand was indeed with him .
42001067	Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied ,
42001068	“ Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , because he has come to help and has redeemed his people .
42001069	For he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ,
42001070	as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago ,
42001071	that we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all who hate us .
42001072	He has done this to show mercy to our ancestors , and to remember his holy covenant –
42001073	the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham . This oath grants
42001074	that we , being rescued from the hand of our enemies , may serve him without fear ,
42001075	in holiness and righteousness before him for as long as we live .
42001076	And you , child , will be called the prophet of the Most High . For you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways ,
42001077	to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins .
42001078	Because of our God’s tender mercy the dawn will break upon us from on high
42001079	to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace . ”
42001080	And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit , and he was in the wilderness until the day he was revealed to Israel .
42002001	Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire for taxes .
42002002	This was the first registration , taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	Everyone went to his own town to be registered .
42002004	So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea , to the city of David called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family line of David .
42002005	He went to be registered with Mary , who was promised in marriage to him , and who was expecting a child .
42002006	While they were there , the time came for her to deliver her child .
42002007	And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger , because there was no place for them in the inn .
42002008	Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field , keeping guard over their flock at night .
42002009	An angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they were absolutely terrified .
42002010	But the angel said to them , “ Do not be afraid ! Listen carefully , for I proclaim to you good news that brings great joy to all the people :
42002011	Today your Savior is born in the city of David . He is Christ the Lord .
42002012	This will be a sign for you : You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger . ”
42002013	Suddenly a vast , heavenly army appeared with the angel , praising God and saying ,
42002014	“ Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased ! ”
42002015	When the angels left them and went back to heaven , the shepherds said to one another , “ Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place , that the Lord has made known to us . ”
42002016	So they hurried off and located Mary and Joseph , and found the baby lying in a manger .
42002017	When they saw him , they related what they had been told about this child ,
42002018	and all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds said .
42002019	But Mary treasured up all these words , pondering in her heart what they might mean .
42002020	So the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen ; everything was just as they had been told .
42002021	At the end of eight days , when he was circumcised , he was named Jesus , the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
42002022	Now when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses , Joseph and Mary brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
42002023	( just as it is written in the law of the Lord , “ Every firstborn male will be set apart to the Lord ” ) ,
42002024	and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord , a pair of doves or two young pigeons .
42002025	Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout , looking for the restoration of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
42002026	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ .
42002027	So Simeon , directed by the Spirit , came into the temple courts , and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law ,
42002028	Simeon took him in his arms and blessed God , saying ,
42002029	“ Now , according to your word , Sovereign Lord , permit your servant to depart in peace .
42002030	For my eyes have seen your salvation
42002031	that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples :
42002032	a light , for revelation to the Gentiles , and for glory to your people Israel . ”
42002033	So the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him .
42002034	Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary , “ Listen carefully : This child is destined to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be rejected .
42002035	Indeed , as a result of him the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed – and a sword will pierce your own soul as well ! ”
42002036	There was also a prophetess , Anna the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was very old , having been married to her husband for seven years until his death .
42002037	She had lived as a widow since then for eighty-four years . She never left the temple , worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day .
42002038	At that moment , she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem .
42002039	So when Joseph and Mary had performed everything according to the law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee , to their own town of Nazareth .
42002040	And the child grew and became strong , filled with wisdom , and the favor of God was upon him .
42002041	Now Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of the Passover .
42002042	When he was twelve years old , they went up according to custom .
42002043	But when the feast was over , as they were returning home , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents did not know it ,
42002044	but ( because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers ) they went a day’s journey . Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances .
42002045	When they did not find him , they returned to Jerusalem to look for him .
42002046	After three days they found him in the temple courts , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers .
42002048	When his parents saw him , they were overwhelmed . His mother said to him , “ Child , why have you treated us like this ? Look , your father and I have been looking for you anxiously . ”
42002049	But he replied , “ Why were you looking for me ? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house ? ”
42002050	Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them .
42002051	Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth , and was obedient to them . But his mother kept all these things in her heart .
42002052	And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature , and in favor with God and with people .
42003001	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene ,
42003002	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness .
42003003	He went into all the region around the Jordan River , preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
42003004	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , “ The voice of one shouting in the wilderness : ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord , make his paths straight .
42003005	Every valley will be filled , and every mountain and hill will be brought low , and the crooked will be made straight , and the rough ways will be made smooth ,
42003006	and all humanity will see the salvation of God . ’ ”
42003007	So John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him , “ You offspring of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
42003008	Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance , and don’t begin to say to yourselves , ‘ We have Abraham as our father . ’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones !
42003009	Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees , and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire . ”
42003010	So the crowds were asking him , “ What then should we do ? ”
42003011	John answered them , “ The person who has two tunics must share with the person who has none , and the person who has food must do likewise . ”
42003012	Tax collectors also came to be baptized , and they said to him , “ Teacher , what should we do ? ”
42003013	He told them , “ Collect no more than you are required to . ”
42003014	Then some soldiers also asked him , “ And as for us – what should we do ? ” He told them , “ Take money from no one by violence or by false accusation , and be content with your pay . ”
42003015	While the people were filled with anticipation and they all wondered whether perhaps John could be the Christ ,
42003016	John answered them all , “ I baptize you with water , but one more powerful than I am is coming – I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
42003017	His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse , but the chaff he will burn up with inextinguishable fire . ”
42003018	And in this way , with many other exhortations , John proclaimed good news to the people .
42003019	But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias , his brother’s wife , and because of all the evil deeds that he had done ,
42003020	Herod added this to them all : He locked up John in prison .
42003021	Now when all the people were baptized , Jesus also was baptized . And while he was praying , the heavens opened ,
42003022	and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove . And a voice came from heaven , “ You are my one dear Son ; in you I take great delight . ”
42003023	So Jesus , when he began his ministry , was about thirty years old . He was the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	the son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	the son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	the son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	the son of Joshua , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	the son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	the son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	the son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Sala , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	the son of Amminadab , the son of Admin , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	the son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	the son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	the son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	the son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalalel , the son of Kenan ,
42003038	the son of Enosh , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	Then Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan River and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness ,
42004002	where for forty days he endured temptations from the devil . He ate nothing during those days , and when they were completed , he was famished .
42004003	The devil said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , command this stone to become bread . ”
42004004	Jesus answered him , “ It is written , ‘ Man does not live by bread alone . ’ ”
42004005	Then the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in a flash all the kingdoms of the world .
42004006	And he said to him , “ To you I will grant this whole realm – and the glory that goes along with it , for it has been relinquished to me , and I can give it to anyone I wish .
42004007	So then , if you will worship me , all this will be yours . ”
42004008	Jesus answered him , “ It is written , ‘ You are to worship the Lord your God and serve only him . ’ ”
42004009	Then the devil brought him to Jerusalem , had him stand on the highest point of the temple , and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down from here ,
42004010	for it is written , ‘ He will command his angels concerning you , to protect you , ’
42004011	and ‘ with their hands they will lift you up , so that you will not strike your foot against a stone . ’ ”
42004012	Jesus answered him , “ It is said , ‘ You are not to put the Lord your God to the test . ’ ”
42004013	So when the devil had completed every temptation , he departed from him until a more opportune time .
42004014	Then Jesus , in the power of the Spirit , returned to Galilee , and news about him spread throughout the surrounding countryside .
42004015	He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by all .
42004016	Now Jesus came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up , and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , as was his custom . He stood up to read ,
42004017	and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him . He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written ,
42004018	“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and the regaining of sight to the blind , to set free those who are oppressed ,
42004019	to proclaim the year of the Lord ’ s favor . ”
42004020	Then he rolled up the scroll , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him .
42004021	Then he began to tell them , “ Today this scripture has been fulfilled even as you heard it being read . ”
42004022	All were speaking well of him , and were amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth . They said , “ Isn’t this Joseph’s son ? ”
42004023	Jesus said to them , “ No doubt you will quote to me the proverb , ‘ Physician , heal yourself ! ’ and say , ‘ What we have heard that you did in Capernaum , do here in your hometown too . ’ ”
42004024	And he added , “ I tell you the truth , no prophet is acceptable in his hometown .
42004025	But in truth I tell you , there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days , when the sky was shut up three and a half years , and there was a great famine over all the land .
42004026	Yet Elijah was sent to none of them , but only to a woman who was a widow at Zarephath in Sidon .
42004027	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha , yet none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian . ”
42004028	When they heard this , all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage .
42004029	They got up , forced him out of the town , and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built , so that they could throw him down the cliff .
42004030	But he passed through the crowd and went on his way .
42004031	So he went down to Capernaum , a town in Galilee , and on the Sabbath he began to teach the people .
42004032	They were amazed at his teaching , because he spoke with authority .
42004033	Now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
42004034	“ Ha ! Leave us alone , Jesus the Nazarene ! Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are – the Holy One of God . ”
42004035	But Jesus rebuked him : “ Silence ! Come out of him ! ” Then , after the demon threw the man down in their midst , he came out of him without hurting him .
42004036	They were all amazed and began to say to one another , “ What’s happening here ? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out ! ”
42004037	So the news about him spread into all areas of the region .
42004038	After Jesus left the synagogue , he entered Simon’s house . Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever , and they asked Jesus to help her .
42004039	So he stood over her , commanded the fever , and it left her . Immediately she got up and began to serve them .
42004040	As the sun was setting , all those who had any relatives sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus . He placed his hands on every one of them and healed them .
42004041	Demons also came out of many , crying out , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But he rebuked them , and would not allow them to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
42004042	The next morning Jesus departed and went to a deserted place . Yet the crowds were seeking him , and they came to him and tried to keep him from leaving them .
42004043	But Jesus said to them , “ I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns too , for that is what I was sent to do . ”
42004044	So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea .
42005001	Now Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret , and the crowd was pressing around him to hear the word of God .
42005002	He saw two boats by the lake , but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets .
42005003	He got into one of the boats , which was Simon’s , and asked him to put out a little way from the shore . Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowds from the boat .
42005004	When he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , “ Put out into the deep water and lower your nets for a catch . ”
42005005	Simon answered , “ Master , we worked hard all night and caught nothing ! But at your word I will lower the nets . ”
42005006	When they had done this , they caught so many fish that their nets started to tear .
42005007	So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them . And they came and filled both boats , so that they were about to sink .
42005008	But when Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus’ knees , saying , “ Go away from me , Lord , for I am a sinful man ! ”
42005009	For Peter and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken ,
42005010	and so were James and John , Zebedee’s sons , who were Simon’s business partners . Then Jesus said to Simon , “ Do not be afraid ; from now on you will be catching people . ”
42005011	So when they had brought their boats to shore , they left everything and followed him .
42005012	While Jesus was in one of the towns , a man came to him who was covered with leprosy . When he saw Jesus , he bowed down with his face to the ground and begged him , “ Lord , if you are willing , you can make me clean . ”
42005013	So he stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I am willing . Be clean ! ” And immediately the leprosy left him .
42005014	Then he ordered the man to tell no one , but commanded him , “ Go and show yourself to a priest , and bring the offering for your cleansing , as Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . ”
42005015	But the news about him spread even more , and large crowds were gathering together to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses .
42005016	Yet Jesus himself frequently withdrew to the wilderness and prayed .
42005017	Now on one of those days , while he was teaching , there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting nearby ( who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem ) , and the power of the Lord was with him to heal .
42005018	Just then some men showed up , carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher . They were trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus .
42005019	But since they found no way to carry him in because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and let him down on the stretcher through the roof tiles right in front of Jesus .
42005020	When Jesus saw their faith he said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven . ”
42005021	Then the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to think to themselves , “ Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
42005022	When Jesus perceived their hostile thoughts , he said to them , “ Why are you raising objections within yourselves ?
42005023	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Stand up and walk ’ ?
42005024	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” – he said to the paralyzed man – “ I tell you , stand up , take your stretcher and go home . ”
42005025	Immediately he stood up before them , picked up the stretcher he had been lying on , and went home , glorifying God .
42005026	Then astonishment seized them all , and they glorified God . They were filled with awe , saying , “ We have seen incredible things today . ”
42005027	After this , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth . “ Follow me , ” he said to him .
42005028	And he got up and followed him , leaving everything behind .
42005029	Then Levi gave a great banquet in his house for Jesus , and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table with them .
42005030	But the Pharisees and their experts in the law complained to his disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
42005031	Jesus answered them , “ Those who are well don’t need a physician , but those who are sick do .
42005032	I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . ”
42005033	Then they said to him , “ John’s disciples frequently fast and pray , and so do the disciples of the Pharisees , but yours continue to eat and drink . ”
42005034	So Jesus said to them , “ You cannot make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them , can you ?
42005035	But those days are coming , and when the bridegroom is taken from them , at that time they will fast . ”
42005036	He also told them a parable : “ No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old garment . If he does , he will have torn the new , and the piece from the new will not match the old .
42005037	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins . If he does , the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled , and the skins will be destroyed .
42005038	Instead new wine must be poured into new wineskins .
42005039	No one after drinking old wine wants the new , for he says , ‘ The old is good enough . ’ ”
42006001	Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath , and his disciples picked some heads of wheat , rubbed them in their hands , and ate them .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees said , “ Why are you doing what is against the law on the Sabbath ? ”
42006003	Jesus answered them , “ Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry –
42006004	how he entered the house of God , took and ate the sacred bread , which is not lawful for any to eat but the priests alone , and gave it to his companions ? ”
42006005	Then he said to them , “ The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath . ”
42006006	On another Sabbath , Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching . Now a man was there whose right hand was withered .
42006007	The experts in the law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath , so that they could find a reason to accuse him .
42006008	But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Get up and stand here . ” So he rose and stood there .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them , “ I ask you , is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil , to save a life or to destroy it ? ”
42006010	After looking around at them all , he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” The man did so , and his hand was restored .
42006011	But they were filled with mindless rage and began debating with one another what they would do to Jesus .
42006012	Now it was during this time that Jesus went out to the mountain to pray , and he spent all night in prayer to God .
42006013	When morning came , he called his disciples and chose twelve of them , whom he also named apostles :
42006014	Simon ( whom he named Peter ) , and his brother Andrew ; and James , John , Philip , Bartholomew ,
42006015	Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon who was called the Zealot ,
42006016	Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
42006017	Then he came down with them and stood on a level place . And a large number of his disciples had gathered along with a vast multitude from all over Judea , from Jerusalem , and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon . They came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases ,
42006018	and those who suffered from unclean spirits were cured .
42006019	The whole crowd was trying to touch him , because power was coming out from him and healing them all .
42006020	Then he looked up at his disciples and said : “ Blessed are you who are poor , for the kingdom of God belongs to you .
42006021	“ Blessed are you who hunger now , for you will be satisfied . “ Blessed are you who weep now , for you will laugh .
42006022	“ Blessed are you when people hate you , and when they exclude you and insult you and reject you as evil on account of the Son of Man !
42006023	Rejoice in that day , and jump for joy , because your reward is great in heaven . For their ancestors did the same things to the prophets .
42006024	“ But woe to you who are rich , for you have received your comfort already .
42006025	“ Woe to you who are well satisfied with food now , for you will be hungry . “ Woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
42006026	“ Woe to you when all people speak well of you , for their ancestors did the same things to the false prophets .
42006027	“ But I say to you who are listening : Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
42006028	bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you .
42006029	To the person who strikes you on the cheek , offer the other as well , and from the person who takes away your coat , do not withhold your tunic either .
42006030	Give to everyone who asks you , and do not ask for your possessions back from the person who takes them away .
42006031	Treat others in the same way that you would want them to treat you .
42006032	“ If you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? For even sinners love those who love them .
42006033	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners do the same .
42006034	And if you lend to those from whom you hope to be repaid , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , so that they may be repaid in full .
42006035	But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing back . Then your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High , because he is kind to ungrateful and evil people .
42006036	Be merciful , just as your Father is merciful .
42006037	“ Do not judge , and you will not be judged ; do not condemn , and you will not be condemned ; forgive , and you will be forgiven .
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you : A good measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over , will be poured into your lap . For the measure you use will be the measure you receive . ”
42006039	He also told them a parable : “ Someone who is blind cannot lead another who is blind , can he ? Won’t they both fall into a pit ?
42006040	A disciple is not greater than his teacher , but everyone when fully trained will be like his teacher .
42006041	Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye , but fail to see the beam of wood in your own ?
42006042	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me remove the speck from your eye , ’ while you yourself don’t see the beam in your own ? You hypocrite ! First remove the beam from your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye .
42006043	“ For no good tree bears bad fruit , nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit ,
42006044	for each tree is known by its own fruit . For figs are not gathered from thorns , nor are grapes picked from brambles .
42006045	The good person out of the good treasury of his heart produces good , and the evil person out of his evil treasury produces evil , for his mouth speaks from what fills his heart .
42006046	“ Why do you call me ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ and don’t do what I tell you ?
42006047	“ Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and puts them into practice – I will show you what he is like :
42006048	He is like a man building a house , who dug down deep , and laid the foundation on bedrock . When a flood came , the river burst against that house but could not shake it , because it had been well built .
42006049	But the person who hears and does not put my words into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation . When the river burst against that house , it collapsed immediately , and was utterly destroyed ! ”
42007001	After Jesus had finished teaching all this to the people , he entered Capernaum .
42007002	A centurion there had a slave who was highly regarded , but who was sick and at the point of death .
42007003	When the centurion heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to him , asking him to come and heal his slave .
42007004	When they came to Jesus , they urged him earnestly , “ He is worthy to have you do this for him ,
42007005	because he loves our nation , and even built our synagogue . ”
42007006	So Jesus went with them . When he was not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to say to him , “ Lord , do not trouble yourself , for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof .
42007007	That is why I did not presume to come to you . Instead , say the word , and my servant must be healed .
42007008	For I too am a man set under authority , with soldiers under me . I say to this one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come , ’ and he comes , and to my slave , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it . ”
42007009	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed at him . He turned and said to the crowd that followed him , “ I tell you , not even in Israel have I found such faith ! ”
42007010	So when those who had been sent returned to the house , they found the slave well .
42007011	Soon afterward Jesus went to a town called Nain , and his disciples and a large crowd went with him .
42007012	As he approached the town gate , a man who had died was being carried out , the only son of his mother ( who was a widow ) , and a large crowd from the town was with her .
42007013	When the Lord saw her , he had compassion for her and said to her , “ Do not weep . ”
42007014	Then he came up and touched the bier , and those who carried it stood still . He said , “ Young man , I say to you , get up ! ”
42007015	So the dead man sat up and began to speak , and Jesus gave him back to his mother .
42007016	Fear seized them all , and they began to glorify God , saying , “ A great prophet has appeared among us ! ” and “ God has come to help his people ! ”
42007017	This report about Jesus circulated throughout Judea and all the surrounding country .
42007018	John’s disciples informed him about all these things . So John called two of his disciples
42007019	and sent them to Jesus to ask , “ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? ”
42007020	When the men came to Jesus , they said , “ John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask , ‘ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? ’ ”
42007021	At that very time Jesus cured many people of diseases , sicknesses , and evil spirits , and granted sight to many who were blind .
42007022	So he answered them , “ Go tell John what you have seen and heard : The blind see , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , the poor have good news proclaimed to them .
42007023	Blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me . ”
42007024	When John’s messengers had gone , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
42007025	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fancy clothes ? Look , those who wear fancy clothes and live in luxury are in kings’ courts !
42007026	What did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	This is the one about whom it is written , ‘ Look , I am sending my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way before you . ’
42007028	I tell you , among those born of women no one is greater than John . Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he is . ”
42007029	( Now all the people who heard this , even the tax collectors , acknowledged God’s justice , because they had been baptized with John’s baptism .
42007030	However , the Pharisees and the experts in religious law rejected God’s purpose for themselves , because they had not been baptized by John . )
42007031	“ To what then should I compare the people of this generation , and what are they like ?
42007032	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another , ‘ We played the flute for you , yet you did not dance ; we wailed in mourning , yet you did not weep . ’
42007033	For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
42007034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Look at him , a glutton and a drunk , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
42007035	But wisdom is vindicated by all her children . ”
42007036	Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him , so he went into the Pharisee’s house and took his place at the table .
42007037	Then when a woman of that town , who was a sinner , learned that Jesus was dining at the Pharisee’s house , she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil .
42007038	As she stood behind him at his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears . She wiped them with her hair , kissed them , and anointed them with the perfumed oil .
42007039	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this , he said to himself , “ If this man were a prophet , he would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him , that she is a sinner . ”
42007040	So Jesus answered him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you . ” He replied , “ Say it , Teacher . ”
42007041	“ A certain creditor had two debtors ; one owed him five hundred silver coins , and the other fifty .
42007042	When they could not pay , he canceled the debts of both . Now which of them will love him more ? ”
42007043	Simon answered , “ I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled . ” Jesus said to him , “ You have judged rightly . ”
42007044	Then , turning toward the woman , he said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered your house . You gave me no water for my feet , but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You gave me no kiss of greeting , but from the time I entered she has not stopped kissing my feet .
42007046	You did not anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with perfumed oil .
42007047	Therefore I tell you , her sins , which were many , are forgiven , thus she loved much ; but the one who is forgiven little loves little . ”
42007048	Then Jesus said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven . ”
42007049	But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves , “ Who is this , who even forgives sins ? ”
42007050	He said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you ; go in peace . ”
42008001	Some time afterward he went on through towns and villages , preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God . The twelve were with him ,
42008002	and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and disabilities : Mary ( called Magdalene ) , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
42008003	and Joanna the wife of Cuza ( Herod’s household manager ) , Susanna , and many others who provided for them out of their own resources .
42008004	While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one town after another , he spoke to them in a parable :
42008005	“ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell along the path and was trampled on , and the wild birds devoured it .
42008006	Other seed fell on rock , and when it came up , it withered because it had no moisture .
42008007	Other seed fell among the thorns , and they grew up with it and choked it .
42008008	But other seed fell on good soil and grew , and it produced a hundred times as much grain . ” As he said this , he called out , “ The one who has ears to hear had better listen ! ”
42008009	Then his disciples asked him what this parable meant .
42008010	He said , “ You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of God , but for others they are in parables , so that although they see they may not see , and although they hear they may not understand .
42008011	“ Now the parable means this : The seed is the word of God .
42008012	Those along the path are the ones who have heard ; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts , so that they may not believe and be saved .
42008013	Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it , but they have no root . They believe for a while , but in a time of testing fall away .
42008014	As for the seed that fell among thorns , these are the ones who hear , but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life , and their fruit does not mature .
42008015	But as for the seed that landed on good soil , these are the ones who , after hearing the word , cling to it with an honest and good heart , and bear fruit with steadfast endurance .
42008016	“ No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed , but puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in can see the light .
42008017	For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed , and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light .
42008018	So listen carefully , for whoever has will be given more , but whoever does not have , even what he thinks he has will be taken from him . ”
42008019	Now Jesus’ mother and his brothers came to him , but they could not get near him because of the crowd .
42008020	So he was told , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , wanting to see you . ”
42008021	But he replied to them , “ My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it . ”
42008022	One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them , “ Let’s go across to the other side of the lake . ” So they set out ,
42008023	and as they sailed he fell asleep . Now a violent windstorm came down on the lake , and the boat started filling up with water , and they were in danger .
42008024	They came and woke him , saying , “ Master , Master , we are about to die ! ” So he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves ; they died down , and it was calm .
42008025	Then he said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” But they were afraid and amazed , saying to one another , “ Who then is this ? He commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him ! ”
42008026	So they sailed over to the region of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42008027	As Jesus stepped ashore , a certain man from the town met him who was possessed by demons . For a long time this man had worn no clothes and had not lived in a house , but among the tombs .
42008028	When he saw Jesus , he cried out , fell down before him , and shouted with a loud voice , “ Leave me alone , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ! I beg you , do not torment me ! ”
42008029	For Jesus had started commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man . ( For it had seized him many times , so he would be bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard . But he would break the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places . )
42008030	Jesus then asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He said , “ Legion , ” because many demons had entered him .
42008031	And they began to beg him not to order them to depart into the abyss .
42008032	Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside , and the demonic spirits begged Jesus to let them go into them . He gave them permission .
42008033	So the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs , and the herd of pigs rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned .
42008034	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside .
42008035	So the people went out to see what had happened , and they came to Jesus . They found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting at Jesus’ feet , clothed and in his right mind , and they were afraid .
42008036	Those who had seen it told them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed .
42008037	Then all the people of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Jesus to leave them alone , for they were seized with great fear . So he got into the boat and left .
42008038	The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him , but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
42008039	“ Return to your home , and declare what God has done for you . ” So he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole town what Jesus had done for him .
42008040	Now when Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , because they were all waiting for him .
42008041	Then a man named Jairus , who was a ruler of the synagogue , came up . Falling at Jesus’ feet , he pleaded with him to come to his house ,
42008042	because he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . As Jesus was on his way , the crowds pressed around him .
42008043	Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years but could not be healed by anyone .
42008044	She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak , and at once the bleeding stopped .
42008045	Then Jesus asked , “ Who was it who touched me ? ” When they all denied it , Peter said , “ Master , the crowds are surrounding you and pressing against you ! ”
42008046	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me , for I know that power has gone out from me . ”
42008047	When the woman saw that she could not escape notice , she came trembling and fell down before him . In the presence of all the people , she explained why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed .
42008048	Then he said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has made you well . Go in peace . ”
42008049	While he was still speaking , someone from the synagogue ruler’s house came and said , “ Your daughter is dead ; do not trouble the teacher any longer . ”
42008050	But when Jesus heard this , he told him , “ Do not be afraid ; just believe , and she will be healed . ”
42008051	Now when he came to the house , Jesus did not let anyone go in with him except Peter , John , and James , and the child’s father and mother .
42008052	Now they were all wailing and mourning for her , but he said , “ Stop your weeping ; she is not dead but asleep . ”
42008053	And they began making fun of him , because they knew that she was dead .
42008054	But Jesus gently took her by the hand and said , “ Child , get up . ”
42008055	Her spirit returned , and she got up immediately . Then he told them to give her something to eat .
42008056	Her parents were astonished , but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened .
42009001	After Jesus called the twelve together , he gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases ,
42009002	and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick .
42009003	He said to them , “ Take nothing for your journey – no staff , no bag , no bread , no money , and do not take an extra tunic .
42009004	Whatever house you enter , stay there until you leave the area .
42009005	Wherever they do not receive you , as you leave that town , shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them . ”
42009006	Then they departed and went throughout the villages , proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening , and he was thoroughly perplexed , because some people were saying that John had been raised from the dead ,
42009008	while others were saying that Elijah had appeared , and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had risen .
42009009	Herod said , “ I had John beheaded , but who is this about whom I hear such things ? ” So Herod wanted to learn about Jesus .
42009010	When the apostles returned , they told Jesus everything they had done . Then he took them with him and they withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida .
42009011	But when the crowds found out , they followed him . He welcomed them , spoke to them about the kingdom of God , and cured those who needed healing .
42009012	Now the day began to draw to a close , so the twelve came and said to Jesus , “ Send the crowd away , so they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and food , because we are in an isolated place . ”
42009013	But he said to them , “ You give them something to eat . ” They replied , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fish – unless we go and buy food for all these people . ”
42009014	( Now about five thousand men were there . ) Then he said to his disciples , “ Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each . ”
42009015	So they did as Jesus directed , and the people all sat down .
42009016	Then he took the five loaves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke them . He gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd .
42009017	They all ate and were satisfied , and what was left over was picked up – twelve baskets of broken pieces .
42009018	Once when Jesus was praying by himself , and his disciples were nearby , he asked them , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ”
42009019	They answered , “ John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others that one of the prophets of long ago has risen . ”
42009020	Then he said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered , “ The Christ of God . ”
42009021	But he forcefully commanded them not to tell this to anyone ,
42009022	saying , “ The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and experts in the law , and be killed , and on the third day be raised . ”
42009023	Then he said to them all , “ If anyone wants to become my follower , he must deny himself , take up his cross daily , and follow me .
42009024	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it .
42009025	For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself ?
42009026	For whoever is ashamed of me and my words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	But I tell you most certainly , there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God . ”
42009028	Now about eight days after these sayings , Jesus took with him Peter , John , and James , and went up the mountain to pray .
42009029	As he was praying , the appearance of his face was transformed , and his clothes became very bright , a brilliant white .
42009030	Then two men , Moses and Elijah , began talking with him .
42009031	They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke about his departure that he was about to carry out at Jerusalem .
42009032	Now Peter and those with him were quite sleepy , but as they became fully awake , they saw his glory and the two men standing with him .
42009033	Then as the men were starting to leave , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good for us to be here . Let us make three shelters , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah ” – not knowing what he was saying .
42009034	As he was saying this , a cloud came and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered the cloud .
42009035	Then a voice came from the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , my Chosen One . Listen to him ! ”
42009036	After the voice had spoken , Jesus was found alone . So they kept silent and told no one at that time anything of what they had seen .
42009037	Now on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , a large crowd met him .
42009038	Then a man from the crowd cried out , “ Teacher , I beg you to look at my son – he is my only child !
42009039	A spirit seizes him , and he suddenly screams ; it throws him into convulsions and causes him to foam at the mouth . It hardly ever leaves him alone , torturing him severely .
42009040	I begged your disciples to cast it out , but they could not do so . ”
42009041	Jesus answered , “ You unbelieving and perverse generation ! How much longer must I be with you and endure you ? Bring your son here . ”
42009042	As the boy was approaching , the demon threw him to the ground and shook him with convulsions . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	Then they were all astonished at the mighty power of God . But while the entire crowd was amazed at everything Jesus was doing , he said to his disciples ,
42009044	“ Take these words to heart , for the Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men . ”
42009045	But they did not understand this statement ; its meaning had been concealed from them , so that they could not grasp it . Yet they were afraid to ask him about this statement .
42009046	Now an argument started among the disciples as to which of them might be the greatest .
42009047	But when Jesus discerned their innermost thoughts , he took a child , had him stand by his side ,
42009048	and said to them , “ Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me , and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me , for the one who is least among you all is the one who is great . ”
42009049	John answered , “ Master , we saw someone casting out demons in your name , and we tried to stop him because he is not a disciple along with us . ”
42009050	But Jesus said to him , “ Do not stop him , for whoever is not against you is for you . ”
42009051	Now when the days drew near for him to be taken up , Jesus set out resolutely to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	He sent messengers on ahead of him . As they went along , they entered a Samaritan village to make things ready in advance for him ,
42009053	but the villagers refused to welcome him , because he was determined to go to Jerusalem .
42009054	Now when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them ? ”
42009055	But Jesus turned and rebuked them ,
42009056	and they went on to another village .
42009057	As they were walking along the road , someone said to him , “ I will follow you wherever you go . ”
42009058	Jesus said to him , “ Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky have nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . ”
42009059	Jesus said to another , “ Follow me . ” But he replied , “ Lord , first let me go and bury my father . ”
42009060	But Jesus said to him , “ Let the dead bury their own dead , but as for you , go and proclaim the kingdom of God . ”
42009061	Yet another said , “ I will follow you , Lord , but first let me say goodbye to my family . ”
42009062	Jesus said to him , “ No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God . ”
42010001	After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he himself was about to go .
42010002	He said to them , “ The harvest is plentiful , but the workers are few . Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest .
42010003	Go ! I am sending you out like lambs surrounded by wolves .
42010004	Do not carry a money bag , a traveler’s bag , or sandals , and greet no one on the road .
42010005	Whenever you enter a house , first say , ‘ May peace be on this house ! ’
42010006	And if a peace-loving person is there , your peace will remain on him , but if not , it will return to you .
42010007	Stay in that same house , eating and drinking what they give you , for the worker deserves his pay . Do not move around from house to house .
42010008	Whenever you enter a town and the people welcome you , eat what is set before you .
42010009	Heal the sick in that town and say to them , ‘ The kingdom of God has come upon you ! ’
42010010	But whenever you enter a town and the people do not welcome you , go into its streets and say ,
42010011	‘ Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you . Nevertheless know this : The kingdom of God has come . ’
42010012	I tell you , it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town !
42010013	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you !
42010015	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? No , you will be thrown down to Hades !
42010016	“ The one who listens to you listens to me , and the one who rejects you rejects me , and the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me . ”
42010017	Then the seventy-two returned with joy , saying , “ Lord , even the demons submit to us in your name ! ”
42010018	So he said to them , “ I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven .
42010019	Look , I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and on the full force of the enemy , and nothing will hurt you .
42010020	Nevertheless , do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you , but rejoice that your names stand written in heaven . ”
42010021	On that same occasion Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent , and revealed them to little children . Yes , Father , for this was your gracious will .
42010022	All things have been given to me by my Father . No one knows who the Son is except the Father , or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him . ”
42010023	Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said privately , “ Blessed are the eyes that see what you see !
42010024	For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see but did not see it , and to hear what you hear but did not hear it . ”
42010025	Now an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus , saying , “ Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
42010026	He said to him , “ What is written in the law ? How do you understand it ? ”
42010027	The expert answered , “ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your strength , and with all your mind , and love your neighbor as yourself . ”
42010028	Jesus said to him , “ You have answered correctly ; do this , and you will live . ”
42010029	But the expert , wanting to justify himself , said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
42010030	Jesus replied , “ A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell into the hands of robbers , who stripped him , beat him up , and went off , leaving him half dead .
42010031	Now by chance a priest was going down that road , but when he saw the injured man he passed by on the other side .
42010032	So too a Levite , when he came up to the place and saw him , passed by on the other side .
42010033	But a Samaritan who was traveling came to where the injured man was , and when he saw him , he felt compassion for him .
42010034	He went up to him and bandaged his wounds , pouring oil and wine on them . Then he put him on his own animal , brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
42010035	The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper , saying , ‘ Take care of him , and whatever else you spend , I will repay you when I come back this way . ’
42010036	Which of these three do you think became a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers ? ”
42010037	The expert in religious law said , “ The one who showed mercy to him . ” So Jesus said to him , “ Go and do the same . ”
42010038	Now as they went on their way , Jesus entered a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him as a guest .
42010039	She had a sister named Mary , who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to what he said .
42010040	But Martha was distracted with all the preparations she had to make , so she came up to him and said , “ Lord , don’t you care that my sister has left me to do all the work alone ? Tell her to help me . ”
42010041	But the Lord answered her , “ Martha , Martha , you are worried and troubled about many things ,
42010042	but one thing is needed . Mary has chosen the best part ; it will not be taken away from her . ”
42011001	Now Jesus was praying in a certain place . When he stopped , one of his disciples said to him , “ Lord , teach us to pray , just as John taught his disciples . ”
42011002	So he said to them , “ When you pray , say : Father , may your name be honored ; may your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us each day our daily bread ,
42011004	and forgive us our sins , for we also forgive everyone who sins against us . And do not lead us into temptation . ”
42011005	Then he said to them , “ Suppose one of you has a friend , and you go to him at midnight and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves of bread ,
42011006	because a friend of mine has stopped here while on a journey , and I have nothing to set before him . ’
42011007	Then he will reply from inside , ‘ Do not bother me . The door is already shut , and my children and I are in bed . I cannot get up and give you anything . ’
42011008	I tell you , even though the man inside will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend , yet because of the first man’s sheer persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs .
42011009	“ So I tell you : Ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and the door will be opened for you .
42011010	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks , the door will be opened .
42011011	What father among you , if your son asks for a fish , will give him a snake instead of a fish ?
42011012	Or if he asks for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
42011013	If you then , although you are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ”
42011014	Now he was casting out a demon that was mute . When the demon had gone out , the man who had been mute began to speak , and the crowds were amazed .
42011015	But some of them said , “ By the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons , he casts out demons . ”
42011016	Others , to test him , began asking for a sign from heaven .
42011017	But Jesus , realizing their thoughts , said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed , and a divided household falls .
42011018	So if Satan too is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? I ask you this because you claim that I cast out demons by Beelzebul .
42011019	Now if I cast out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons cast them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
42011020	But if I cast out demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has already overtaken you .
42011021	When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his possessions are safe .
42011022	But when a stronger man attacks and conquers him , he takes away the first man’s armor on which the man relied and divides up his plunder .
42011023	Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
42011024	“ When an unclean spirit goes out of a person , it passes through waterless places looking for rest but not finding any . Then it says , ‘ I will return to the home I left . ’
42011025	When it returns , it finds the house swept clean and put in order .
42011026	Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and live there , so the last state of that person is worse than the first . ”
42011027	As he said these things , a woman in the crowd spoke out to him , “ Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed ! ”
42011028	But he replied , “ Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it ! ”
42011029	As the crowds were increasing , Jesus began to say , “ This generation is a wicked generation ; it looks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah .
42011030	For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh , so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon – and now , something greater than Solomon is here !
42011032	The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they repented when Jonah preached to them – and now , something greater than Jonah is here !
42011033	“ No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a hidden place or under a basket , but on a lampstand , so that those who come in can see the light .
42011034	Your eye is the lamp of your body . When your eye is healthy , your whole body is full of light , but when it is diseased , your body is full of darkness .
42011035	Therefore see to it that the light in you is not darkness .
42011036	If then your whole body is full of light , with no part in the dark , it will be as full of light as when the light of a lamp shines on you . ”
42011037	As he spoke , a Pharisee invited Jesus to have a meal with him , so he went in and took his place at the table .
42011038	The Pharisee was astonished when he saw that Jesus did not first wash his hands before the meal .
42011039	But the Lord said to him , “ Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the plate , but inside you are full of greed and wickedness .
42011040	You fools ! Didn’t the one who made the outside make the inside as well ?
42011041	But give from your heart to those in need , and then everything will be clean for you .
42011042	“ But woe to you Pharisees ! You give a tenth of your mint , rue , and every herb , yet you neglect justice and love for God ! But you should have done these things without neglecting the others .
42011043	Woe to you Pharisees ! You love the best seats in the synagogues and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces !
42011044	Woe to you ! You are like unmarked graves , and people walk over them without realizing it ! ”
42011045	One of the experts in religious law answered him , “ Teacher , when you say these things you insult us too . ”
42011046	But Jesus replied , “ Woe to you experts in religious law as well ! You load people down with burdens difficult to bear , yet you yourselves refuse to touch the burdens with even one of your fingers !
42011047	Woe to you ! You build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed .
42011048	So you testify that you approve of the deeds of your ancestors , because they killed the prophets and you build their tombs !
42011049	For this reason also the wisdom of God said , ‘ I will send them prophets and apostles , some of whom they will kill and persecute , ’
42011050	so that this generation may be held accountable for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world ,
42011051	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , it will be charged against this generation .
42011052	Woe to you experts in religious law ! You have taken away the key to knowledge ! You did not go in yourselves , and you hindered those who were going in . ”
42011053	When he went out from there , the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to oppose him bitterly , and to ask him hostile questions about many things ,
42011054	plotting against him , to catch him in something he might say .
42012001	Meanwhile , when many thousands of the crowd had gathered so that they were trampling on one another , Jesus began to speak first to his disciples , “ Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
42012002	Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed , and nothing is secret that will not be made known .
42012003	So then whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light , and what you have whispered in private rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops .
42012004	“ I tell you , my friends , do not be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have nothing more they can do .
42012005	But I will warn you whom you should fear : Fear the one who , after the killing , has authority to throw you into hell . Yes , I tell you , fear him !
42012006	Aren’t five sparrows sold for two pennies ? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God .
42012007	In fact , even the hairs on your head are all numbered . Do not be afraid ; you are more valuable than many sparrows .
42012008	“ I tell you , whoever acknowledges me before men , the Son of Man will also acknowledge before God’s angels .
42012009	But the one who denies me before men will be denied before God’s angels .
42012010	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but the person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
42012011	But when they bring you before the synagogues , the rulers , and the authorities , do not worry about how you should make your defense or what you should say ,
42012012	for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you must say . ”
42012013	Then someone from the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me . ”
42012014	But Jesus said to him , “ Man , who made me a judge or arbitrator between you two ? ”
42012015	Then he said to them , “ Watch out and guard yourself from all types of greed , because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions . ”
42012016	He then told them a parable : “ The land of a certain rich man produced an abundant crop ,
42012017	so he thought to himself , ‘ What should I do , for I have nowhere to store my crops ? ’
42012018	Then he said , ‘ I will do this : I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
42012019	And I will say to myself , “ You have plenty of goods stored up for many years ; relax , eat , drink , celebrate ! ” ’
42012020	But God said to him , ‘ You fool ! This very night your life will be demanded back from you , but who will get what you have prepared for yourself ? ’
42012021	So it is with the one who stores up riches for himself , but is not rich toward God . ”
42012022	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat , or about your body , what you will wear .
42012023	For there is more to life than food , and more to the body than clothing .
42012024	Consider the ravens : They do not sow or reap , they have no storeroom or barn , yet God feeds them . How much more valuable are you than the birds !
42012025	And which of you by worrying can add an hour to his life ?
42012026	So if you cannot do such a very little thing as this , why do you worry about the rest ?
42012027	Consider how the flowers grow ; they do not work or spin . Yet I tell you , not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these !
42012028	And if this is how God clothes the wild grass , which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven , how much more will he clothe you , you people of little faith !
42012029	So do not be overly concerned about what you will eat and what you will drink , and do not worry about such things .
42012030	For all the nations of the world pursue these things , and your Father knows that you need them .
42012031	Instead , pursue his kingdom , and these things will be given to you as well .
42012032	“ Do not be afraid , little flock , for your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Sell your possessions and give to the poor . Provide yourselves purses that do not wear out – a treasure in heaven that never decreases , where no thief approaches and no moth destroys .
42012034	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
42012035	“ Get dressed for service and keep your lamps burning ;
42012036	be like people waiting for their master to come back from the wedding celebration , so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him .
42012037	Blessed are those slaves whom their master finds alert when he returns ! I tell you the truth , he will dress himself to serve , have them take their place at the table , and will come and wait on them !
42012038	Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them alert , blessed are those slaves !
42012039	But understand this : If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have let his house be broken into .
42012040	You also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him . ”
42012041	Then Peter said , “ Lord , are you telling this parable for us or for everyone ? ”
42012042	The Lord replied , “ Who then is the faithful and wise manager , whom the master puts in charge of his household servants , to give them their allowance of food at the proper time ?
42012043	Blessed is that slave whom his master finds at work when he returns .
42012044	I tell you the truth , the master will put him in charge of all his possessions .
42012045	But if that slave should say to himself , ‘ My master is delayed in returning , ’ and he begins to beat the other slaves , both men and women , and to eat , drink , and get drunk ,
42012046	then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee , and will cut him in two , and assign him a place with the unfaithful .
42012047	That servant who knew his master’s will but did not get ready or do what his master asked will receive a severe beating .
42012048	But the one who did not know his master’s will and did things worthy of punishment will receive a light beating . From everyone who has been given much , much will be required , and from the one who has been entrusted with much , even more will be asked .
42012049	“ I have come to bring fire on the earth – and how I wish it were already kindled !
42012050	I have a baptism to undergo , and how distressed I am until it is finished !
42012051	Do you think I have come to bring peace on earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division !
42012052	For from now on there will be five in one household divided , three against two and two against three .
42012053	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law . ”
42012054	Jesus also said to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud rising in the west , you say at once , ‘ A rainstorm is coming , ’ and it does .
42012055	And when you see the south wind blowing , you say , ‘ There will be scorching heat , ’ and there is .
42012056	You hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky , but how can you not know how to interpret the present time ?
42012057	“ And why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right ?
42012058	As you are going with your accuser before the magistrate , make an effort to settle with him on the way , so that he will not drag you before the judge , and the judge hand you over to the officer , and the officer throw you into prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will never get out of there until you have paid the very last cent ! ”
42013001	Now there were some present on that occasion who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
42013002	He answered them , “ Do you think these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans , because they suffered these things ?
42013003	No , I tell you ! But unless you repent , you will all perish as well !
42013004	Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them , do you think they were worse offenders than all the others who live in Jerusalem ?
42013005	No , I tell you ! But unless you repent you will all perish as well ! ”
42013006	Then Jesus told this parable : “ A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came looking for fruit on it and found none .
42013007	So he said to the worker who tended the vineyard , ‘ For three years now , I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree , and each time I inspect it I find none . Cut it down ! Why should it continue to deplete the soil ? ’
42013008	But the worker answered him , ‘ Sir , leave it alone this year too , until I dig around it and put fertilizer on it .
42013009	Then if it bears fruit next year , very well , but if not , you can cut it down . ’ ”
42013010	Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath ,
42013011	and a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years . She was bent over and could not straighten herself up completely .
42013012	When Jesus saw her , he called her to him and said , “ Woman , you are freed from your infirmity . ”
42013013	Then he placed his hands on her , and immediately she straightened up and praised God .
42013014	But the president of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , said to the crowd , “ There are six days on which work should be done ! So come and be healed on those days , and not on the Sabbath day . ”
42013015	Then the Lord answered him , “ You hypocrites ! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from its stall , and lead it to water ?
42013016	Then shouldn’t this woman , a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years , be released from this imprisonment on the Sabbath day ? ”
42013017	When he said this all his adversaries were humiliated , but the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things he was doing .
42013018	Thus Jesus asked , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? To what should I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden . It grew and became a tree , and the wild birds nested in its branches . ”
42013020	Again he said , “ To what should I compare the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen . ”
42013022	Then Jesus traveled throughout towns and villages , teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem .
42013023	Someone asked him , “ Lord , will only a few be saved ? ” So he said to them ,
42013024	“ Exert every effort to enter through the narrow door , because many , I tell you , will try to enter and will not be able to .
42013025	Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door , then you will stand outside and start to knock on the door and beg him , ‘ Lord , let us in ! ’ But he will answer you , ‘ I don’t know where you come from . ’
42013026	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . ’
42013027	But he will reply , ‘ I don’t know where you come from ! Go away from me , all you evildoers ! ’
42013028	There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves thrown out .
42013029	Then people will come from east and west , and from north and south , and take their places at the banquet table in the kingdom of God .
42013030	But indeed , some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last . ”
42013031	At that time , some Pharisees came up and said to Jesus , “ Get away from here , because Herod wants to kill you . ”
42013032	But he said to them , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘ Look , I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I will complete my work .
42013033	Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day , because it is impossible that a prophet should be killed outside Jerusalem . ’
42013034	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you ! How often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you would have none of it !
42013035	Look , your house is forsaken ! And I tell you , you will not see me until you say , ‘ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ ”
42014001	Now one Sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader of the Pharisees , they were watching him closely .
42014002	There right in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy .
42014003	So Jesus asked the experts in religious law and the Pharisees , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not ? ”
42014004	But they remained silent . So Jesus took hold of the man , healed him , and sent him away .
42014005	Then he said to them , “ Which of you , if you have a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day , will not immediately pull him out ? ”
42014006	But they could not reply to this .
42014007	Then when Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor , he told them a parable . He said to them ,
42014008	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , do not take the place of honor , because a person more distinguished than you may have been invited by your host .
42014009	So the host who invited both of you will come and say to you , ‘ Give this man your place . ’ Then , ashamed , you will begin to move to the least important place .
42014010	But when you are invited , go and take the least important place , so that when your host approaches he will say to you , ‘ Friend , move up here to a better place . ’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who share the meal with you .
42014011	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42014012	He said also to the man who had invited him , “ When you host a dinner or a banquet , don’t invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors so you can be invited by them in return and get repaid .
42014013	But when you host an elaborate meal , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , and the blind .
42014014	Then you will be blessed , because they cannot repay you , for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous . ”
42014015	When one of those at the meal with Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ Blessed is everyone who will feast in the kingdom of God ! ”
42014016	But Jesus said to him , “ A man once gave a great banquet and invited many guests .
42014017	At the time for the banquet he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited , ‘ Come , because everything is now ready . ’
42014018	But one after another they all began to make excuses . The first said to him , ‘ I have bought a field , and I must go out and see it . Please excuse me . ’
42014019	Another said , ‘ I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going out to examine them . Please excuse me . ’
42014020	Another said , ‘ I just got married , and I cannot come . ’
42014021	So the slave came back and reported this to his master . Then the master of the household was furious and said to his slave , ‘ Go out quickly to the streets and alleys of the city , and bring in the poor , the crippled , the blind , and the lame . ’
42014022	Then the slave said , ‘ Sir , what you instructed has been done , and there is still room . ’
42014023	So the master said to his slave , ‘ Go out to the highways and country roads and urge people to come in , so that my house will be filled .
42014024	For I tell you , not one of those individuals who were invited will taste my banquet ! ’ ”
42014025	Now large crowds were accompanying Jesus , and turning to them he said ,
42014026	“ If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother , and wife and children , and brothers and sisters , and even his own life , he cannot be my disciple .
42014027	Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple .
42014028	For which of you , wanting to build a tower , doesn’t sit down first and compute the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it ?
42014029	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish the tower , all who see it will begin to make fun of him .
42014030	They will say , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish ! ’
42014031	Or what king , going out to confront another king in battle , will not sit down first and determine whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	If he cannot succeed , he will send a representative while the other is still a long way off and ask for terms of peace .
42014033	In the same way therefore not one of you can be my disciple if he does not renounce all his own possessions .
42014034	“ Salt is good , but if salt loses its flavor , how can its flavor be restored ?
42014035	It is of no value for the soil or for the manure pile ; it is to be thrown out . The one who has ears to hear had better listen ! ”
42015001	Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to hear him .
42015002	But the Pharisees and the experts in the law were complaining , “ This man welcomes sinners and eats with them . ”
42015003	So Jesus told them this parable :
42015004	“ Which one of you , if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them , would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go look for the one that is lost until he finds it ?
42015005	Then when he has found it , he places it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	Returning home , he calls together his friends and neighbors , telling them , ‘ Rejoice with me , because I have found my sheep that was lost . ’
42015007	I tell you , in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent .
42015008	“ Or what woman , if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them , does not light a lamp , sweep the house , and search thoroughly until she finds it ?
42015009	Then when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin that I had lost . ’
42015010	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents . ”
42015011	Then Jesus said , “ A man had two sons .
42015012	The younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of the estate that will belong to me . ’ So he divided his assets between them .
42015013	After a few days , the younger son gathered together all he had and left on a journey to a distant country , and there he squandered his wealth with a wild lifestyle .
42015014	Then after he had spent everything , a severe famine took place in that country , and he began to be in need .
42015015	So he went and worked for one of the citizens of that country , who sent him to his fields to feed pigs .
42015016	He was longing to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating , but no one gave him anything .
42015017	But when he came to his senses he said , ‘ How many of my father’s hired workers have food enough to spare , but here I am dying from hunger !
42015018	I will get up and go to my father and say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you .
42015019	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; treat me like one of your hired workers . ” ’
42015020	So he got up and went to his father . But while he was still a long way from home his father saw him , and his heart went out to him ; he ran and hugged his son and kissed him .
42015021	Then his son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son . ’
42015022	But the father said to his slaves , ‘ Hurry ! Bring the best robe , and put it on him ! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet !
42015023	Bring the fattened calf and kill it ! Let us eat and celebrate ,
42015024	because this son of mine was dead , and is alive again – he was lost and is found ! ’ So they began to celebrate .
42015025	“ Now his older son was in the field . As he came and approached the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	So he called one of the slaves and asked what was happening .
42015027	The slave replied , ‘ Your brother has returned , and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got his son back safe and sound . ’
42015028	But the older son became angry and refused to go in . His father came out and appealed to him ,
42015029	but he answered his father , ‘ Look ! These many years I have worked like a slave for you , and I never disobeyed your commands . Yet you never gave me even a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends !
42015030	But when this son of yours came back , who has devoured your assets with prostitutes , you killed the fattened calf for him ! ’
42015031	Then the father said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and everything that belongs to me is yours .
42015032	It was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for your brother was dead , and is alive ; he was lost and is found . ’ ”
42016001	Jesus also said to the disciples , “ There was a rich man who was informed of accusations that his manager was wasting his assets .
42016002	So he called the manager in and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Turn in the account of your administration , because you can no longer be my manager . ’
42016003	Then the manager said to himself , ‘ What should I do , since my master is taking my position away from me ? I’m not strong enough to dig , and I’m too ashamed to beg .
42016004	I know what to do so that when I am put out of management , people will welcome me into their homes . ’
42016005	So he contacted his master’s debtors one by one . He asked the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
42016006	The man replied , ‘ A hundred measures of olive oil . ’ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill , sit down quickly , and write fifty . ’
42016007	Then he said to another , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ The second man replied , ‘ A hundred measures of wheat . ’ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill , and write eighty . ’
42016008	The master commended the dishonest manager because he acted shrewdly . For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their contemporaries than the people of light .
42016009	And I tell you , make friends for yourselves by how you use worldly wealth , so that when it runs out you will be welcomed into the eternal homes .
42016010	“ The one who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much , and the one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much .
42016011	If then you haven’t been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth , who will entrust you with the true riches ?
42016012	And if you haven’t been trustworthy with someone else’s property , who will give you your own ?
42016013	No servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and money . ”
42016014	The Pharisees ( who loved money ) heard all this and ridiculed him .
42016015	But Jesus said to them , “ You are the ones who justify yourselves in men’s eyes , but God knows your hearts . For what is highly prized among men is utterly detestable in God’s sight .
42016016	“ The law and the prophets were in force until John ; since then , the good news of the kingdom of God has been proclaimed , and everyone is urged to enter it .
42016017	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a letter in the law to become void .
42016018	“ Everyone who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery , and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery .
42016019	“ There was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day .
42016020	But at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus whose body was covered with sores ,
42016021	who longed to eat what fell from the rich man’s table . In addition , the dogs came and licked his sores .
42016022	“ Now the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side . The rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	And in hell , as he was in torment , he looked up and saw Abraham far off with Lazarus at his side .
42016024	So he called out , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I am in anguish in this fire . ’
42016025	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember that in your lifetime you received your good things and Lazarus likewise bad things , but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish .
42016026	Besides all this , a great chasm has been fixed between us , so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so , and no one can cross from there to us . ’
42016027	So the rich man said , ‘ Then I beg you , father – send Lazarus to my father’s house
42016028	( for I have five brothers ) to warn them so that they don’t come into this place of torment . ’
42016029	But Abraham said , ‘ They have Moses and the prophets ; they must respond to them . ’
42016030	Then the rich man said , ‘ No , father Abraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent . ’
42016031	He replied to him , ‘ If they do not respond to Moses and the prophets , they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead . ’ ”
42017001	Jesus said to his disciples , “ Stumbling blocks are sure to come , but woe to the one through whom they come !
42017002	It would be better for him to have a millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin .
42017003	Watch yourselves ! If your brother sins , rebuke him . If he repents , forgive him .
42017004	Even if he sins against you seven times in a day , and seven times returns to you saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you must forgive him . ”
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith ! ”
42017006	So the Lord replied , “ If you had faith the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this black mulberry tree , ‘ Be pulled out by the roots and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
42017007	“ Would any one of you say to your slave who comes in from the field after plowing or shepherding sheep , ‘ Come at once and sit down for a meal ’ ?
42017008	Won’t the master instead say to him , ‘ Get my dinner ready , and make yourself ready to serve me while I eat and drink . Then you may eat and drink ’ ?
42017009	He won’t thank the slave because he did what he was told , will he ?
42017010	So you too , when you have done everything you were commanded to do , should say , ‘ We are slaves undeserving of special praise ; we have only done what was our duty . ’ ”
42017011	Now on the way to Jerusalem , Jesus was passing along between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he was entering a village , ten men with leprosy met him . They stood at a distance ,
42017013	raised their voices and said , “ Jesus , Master , have mercy on us . ”
42017014	When he saw them he said , “ Go and show yourselves to the priests . ” And as they went along , they were cleansed .
42017015	Then one of them , when he saw he was healed , turned back , praising God with a loud voice .
42017016	He fell with his face to the ground at Jesus’ feet and thanked him . ( Now he was a Samaritan . )
42017017	Then Jesus said , “ Were not ten cleansed ? Where are the other nine ?
42017018	Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner ? ”
42017019	Then he said to the man , “ Get up and go your way . Your faith has made you well . ”
42017020	Now at one point the Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God was coming , so he answered , “ The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed ,
42017021	nor will they say , ‘ Look , here it is ! ’ or ‘ There ! ’ For indeed , the kingdom of God is in your midst . ”
42017022	Then he said to the disciples , “ The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
42017023	Then people will say to you , ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ or ‘ Look , here he is ! ’ Do not go out or chase after them .
42017024	For just like the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other , so will the Son of Man be in his day .
42017025	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation .
42017026	Just as it was in the days of Noah , so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man .
42017027	People were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were being given in marriage – right up to the day Noah entered the ark . Then the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	Likewise , just as it was in the days of Lot , people were eating , drinking , buying , selling , planting , building ;
42017029	but on the day Lot went out from Sodom , fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all .
42017030	It will be the same on the day the Son of Man is revealed .
42017031	On that day , anyone who is on the roof , with his goods in the house , must not come down to take them away , and likewise the person in the field must not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife !
42017033	Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life will preserve it .
42017034	I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed ; one will be taken and the other left .
42017035	There will be two women grinding grain together ; one will be taken and the other left . ”
42017037	Then the disciples said to him , “ Where , Lord ? ” He replied to them , “ Where the dead body is , there the vultures will gather . ”
42018001	Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart .
42018002	He said , “ In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people .
42018003	There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying , ‘ Give me justice against my adversary . ’
42018004	For a while he refused , but later on he said to himself , ‘ Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people ,
42018005	yet because this widow keeps on bothering me , I will give her justice , or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas . ’ ”
42018006	And the Lord said , “ Listen to what the unrighteous judge says !
42018007	Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones , who cry out to him day and night ? Will he delay long to help them ?
42018008	I tell you , he will give them justice speedily . Nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on earth ? ”
42018009	Jesus also told this parable to some who were confident that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else .
42018010	“ Two men went up to the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself like this : ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other people : extortionists , unrighteous people , adulterers – or even like this tax collector .
42018012	I fast twice a week ; I give a tenth of everything I get . ’
42018013	The tax collector , however , stood far off and would not even look up to heaven , but beat his breast and said , ‘ God , be merciful to me , sinner that I am ! ’
42018014	I tell you that this man went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee . For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted . ”
42018015	Now people were even bringing their babies to him for him to touch . But when the disciples saw it , they began to scold those who brought them .
42018016	But Jesus called for the children , saying , “ Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
42018017	I tell you the truth , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it . ”
42018018	Now a certain ruler asked him , “ Good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
42018019	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
42018020	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery , do not murder , do not steal , do not give false testimony , honor your father and mother . ’ ”
42018021	The man replied , “ I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth . ”
42018022	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ One thing you still lack . Sell all that you have and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me . ”
42018023	But when the man heard this he became very sad , for he was extremely wealthy .
42018024	When Jesus noticed this , he said , “ How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God !
42018025	In fact , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God . ”
42018026	Those who heard this said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
42018027	He replied , “ What is impossible for mere humans is possible for God . ”
42018028	And Peter said , “ Look , we have left everything we own to follow you ! ”
42018029	Then Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the truth , there is no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of God’s kingdom
42018030	who will not receive many times more in this age – and in the age to come , eternal life . ”
42018031	Then Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them , “ Look , we are going up to Jerusalem , and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished .
42018032	For he will be handed over to the Gentiles ; he will be mocked , mistreated , and spat on .
42018033	They will flog him severely and kill him . Yet on the third day he will rise again . ”
42018034	But the twelve understood none of these things . This saying was hidden from them , and they did not grasp what Jesus meant .
42018035	As Jesus approached Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the road begging .
42018036	When he heard a crowd going by , he asked what was going on .
42018037	They told him , “ Jesus the Nazarene is passing by . ”
42018038	So he called out , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018039	And those who were in front scolded him to get him to be quiet , but he shouted even more , “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
42018040	So Jesus stopped and ordered the beggar to be brought to him . When the man came near , Jesus asked him ,
42018041	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He replied , “ Lord , let me see again . ”
42018042	Jesus said to him , “ Receive your sight ; your faith has healed you . ”
42018043	And immediately he regained his sight and followed Jesus , praising God . When all the people saw it , they too gave praise to God .
42019001	Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it .
42019002	Now a man named Zacchaeus was there ; he was a chief tax collector and was rich .
42019003	He was trying to get a look at Jesus , but being a short man he could not see over the crowd .
42019004	So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him , because Jesus was going to pass that way .
42019005	And when Jesus came to that place , he looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , come down quickly , because I must stay at your house today . ”
42019006	So he came down quickly and welcomed Jesus joyfully .
42019007	And when the people saw it , they all complained , “ He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner . ”
42019008	But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord , “ Look , Lord , half of my possessions I now give to the poor , and if I have cheated anyone of anything , I am paying back four times as much ! ”
42019009	Then Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this household , because he too is a son of Abraham !
42019010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost . ”
42019011	While the people were listening to these things , Jesus proceeded to tell a parable , because he was near to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately .
42019012	Therefore he said , “ A nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return .
42019013	And he summoned ten of his slaves , gave them ten minas , and said to them , ‘ Do business with these until I come back . ’
42019014	But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this man to be king over us ! ’
42019015	When he returned after receiving the kingdom , he summoned these slaves to whom he had given the money . He wanted to know how much they had earned by trading .
42019016	So the first one came before him and said , ‘ Sir , your mina has made ten minas more . ’
42019017	And the king said to him , ‘ Well done , good slave ! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter , you will have authority over ten cities . ’
42019018	Then the second one came and said , ‘ Sir , your mina has made five minas . ’
42019019	So the king said to him , ‘ And you are to be over five cities . ’
42019020	Then another slave came and said , ‘ Sir , here is your mina that I put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth .
42019021	For I was afraid of you , because you are a severe man . You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow . ’
42019022	The king said to him , ‘ I will judge you by your own words , you wicked slave ! So you knew , did you , that I was a severe man , withdrawing what I didn’t deposit and reaping what I didn’t sow ?
42019023	Why then didn’t you put my money in the bank , so that when I returned I could have collected it with interest ? ’
42019024	And he said to his attendants , ‘ Take the mina from him , and give it to the one who has ten . ’
42019025	But they said to him , ‘ Sir , he has ten minas already ! ’
42019026	‘ I tell you that everyone who has will be given more , but from the one who does not have , even what he has will be taken away .
42019027	But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king , bring them here and slaughter them in front of me ! ’ ”
42019028	After Jesus had said this , he continued on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	Now when he approached Bethphage and Bethany , at the place called the Mount of Olives , he sent two of the disciples ,
42019030	telling them , “ Go to the village ahead of you . When you enter it , you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
42019031	If anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ just say , ‘ The Lord needs it . ’ ”
42019032	So those who were sent ahead found it exactly as he had told them .
42019033	As they were untying the colt , its owners asked them , “ Why are you untying that colt ? ”
42019034	They replied , “ The Lord needs it . ”
42019035	Then they brought it to Jesus , threw their cloaks on the colt , and had Jesus get on it .
42019036	As he rode along , they spread their cloaks on the road .
42019037	As he approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen :
42019038	“ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! ”
42019039	But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , rebuke your disciples . ”
42019040	He answered , “ I tell you , if they keep silent , the very stones will cry out ! ”
42019041	Now when Jesus approached and saw the city , he wept over it ,
42019042	saying , “ If you had only known on this day , even you , the things that make for peace ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and surround you and close in on you from every side .
42019044	They will demolish you – you and your children within your walls – and they will not leave within you one stone on top of another , because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God . ”
42019045	Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling things there ,
42019046	saying to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house will be a house of prayer , ’ but you have turned it into a den of robbers ! ”
42019047	Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts . The chief priests and the experts in the law and the prominent leaders among the people were seeking to assassinate him ,
42019048	but they could not find a way to do it , for all the people hung on his words .
42020001	Now one day , as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel , the chief priests and the experts in the law with the elders came up
42020002	and said to him , “ Tell us : By what authority are you doing these things ? Or who it is who gave you this authority ? ”
42020003	He answered them , “ I will also ask you a question , and you tell me :
42020004	John’s baptism – was it from heaven or from people ? ”
42020005	So they discussed it with one another , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’
42020006	But if we say , ‘ From people , ’ all the people will stone us , because they are convinced that John was a prophet . ”
42020007	So they replied that they did not know where it came from .
42020008	Then Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by whose authority I do these things . ”
42020009	Then he began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard , leased it to tenant farmers , and went on a journey for a long time .
42020010	When harvest time came , he sent a slave to the tenants so that they would give him his portion of the crop . However , the tenants beat his slave and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	So he sent another slave . They beat this one too , treated him outrageously , and sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	So he sent still a third . They even wounded this one , and threw him out .
42020013	Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What should I do ? I will send my one dear son ; perhaps they will respect him . ’
42020014	But when the tenants saw him , they said to one another , ‘ This is the heir ; let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours ! ’
42020015	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others . ” When the people heard this , they said , “ May this never happen ! ”
42020017	But Jesus looked straight at them and said , “ Then what is the meaning of that which is written : ‘ The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ’ ?
42020018	Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , and the one on whom it falls will be crushed . ”
42020019	Then the experts in the law and the chief priests wanted to arrest him that very hour , because they realized he had told this parable against them . But they were afraid of the people .
42020020	Then they watched him carefully and sent spies who pretended to be sincere . They wanted to take advantage of what he might say so that they could deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor .
42020021	Thus they asked him , “ Teacher , we know that you speak and teach correctly , and show no partiality , but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth .
42020022	Is it right for us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar or not ? ”
42020023	But Jesus perceived their deceit and said to them ,
42020024	“ Show me a denarius . Whose image and inscription are on it ? ” They said , “ Caesar’s . ”
42020025	So he said to them , “ Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s . ”
42020026	Thus they were unable in the presence of the people to trap him with his own words . And stunned by his answer , they fell silent .
42020027	Now some Sadducees ( who contend that there is no resurrection ) came to him .
42020028	They asked him , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies leaving a wife but no children , that man must marry the widow and father children for his brother .
42020029	Now there were seven brothers . The first one married a woman and died without children .
42020030	The second
42020031	and then the third married her , and in this same way all seven died , leaving no children .
42020032	Finally the woman died too .
42020033	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife will the woman be ? For all seven had married her . ”
42020034	So Jesus said to them , “ The people of this age marry and are given in marriage .
42020035	But those who are regarded as worthy to share in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage .
42020036	In fact , they can no longer die , because they are equal to angels and are sons of God , since they are sons of the resurrection .
42020037	But even Moses revealed that the dead are raised in the passage about the bush , where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob .
42020038	Now he is not God of the dead , but of the living , for all live before him . ”
42020039	Then some of the experts in the law answered , “ Teacher , you have spoken well ! ”
42020040	For they did not dare any longer to ask him anything .
42020041	But he said to them , “ How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son ?
42020042	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , ‘ The Lord said to my lord , “ Sit at my right hand ,
42020043	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . ” ’
42020044	If David then calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how can he be his son ? ”
42020045	As all the people were listening , Jesus said to his disciples ,
42020046	“ Beware of the experts in the law . They like walking around in long robes , and they love elaborate greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
42020047	They devour widows’ property , and as a show make long prayers . They will receive a more severe punishment . ”
42021001	Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box .
42021002	He also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins .
42021003	He said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow has put in more than all of them .
42021004	For they all offered their gifts out of their wealth . But she , out of her poverty , put in everything she had to live on . ”
42021005	Now while some were speaking about the temple , how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings , Jesus said ,
42021006	“ As for these things that you are gazing at , the days will come when not one stone will be left on another . All will be torn down ! ”
42021007	So they asked him , “ Teacher , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that these things are about to take place ? ”
42021008	He said , “ Watch out that you are not misled . For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and , ‘ The time is near . ’ Do not follow them !
42021009	And when you hear of wars and rebellions , do not be afraid . For these things must happen first , but the end will not come at once . ”
42021010	Then he said to them , “ Nation will rise up in arms against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	There will be great earthquakes , and famines and plagues in various places , and there will be terrifying sights and great signs from heaven .
42021012	But before all this , they will seize you and persecute you , handing you over to the synagogues and prisons . You will be brought before kings and governors because of my name .
42021013	This will be a time for you to serve as witnesses .
42021014	Therefore be resolved not to rehearse ahead of time how to make your defense .
42021015	For I will give you the words along with the wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict .
42021016	You will be betrayed even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends , and they will have some of you put to death .
42021017	You will be hated by everyone because of my name .
42021018	Yet not a hair of your head will perish .
42021019	By your endurance you will gain your lives .
42021020	“ But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then know that its desolation has come near .
42021021	Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains . Those who are inside the city must depart . Those who are out in the country must not enter it ,
42021022	because these are days of vengeance , to fulfill all that is written .
42021023	Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days ! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people .
42021024	They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away as captives among all nations . Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled .
42021025	“ And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars , and on the earth nations will be in distress , anxious over the roaring of the sea and the surging waves .
42021026	People will be fainting from fear and from the expectation of what is coming on the world , for the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
42021027	Then they will see the Son of Man arriving in a cloud with power and great glory .
42021028	But when these things begin to happen , stand up and raise your heads , because your redemption is drawing near . ”
42021029	Then he told them a parable : “ Look at the fig tree and all the other trees .
42021030	When they sprout leaves , you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near .
42021031	So also you , when you see these things happening , know that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	I tell you the truth , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place .
42021033	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
42021034	“ But be on your guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life , and that day close down upon you suddenly like a trap .
42021035	For it will overtake all who live on the face of the whole earth .
42021036	But stay alert at all times , praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that must happen , and to stand before the Son of Man . ”
42021037	So every day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts , but at night he went and stayed on the Mount of Olives .
42021038	And all the people came to him early in the morning to listen to him in the temple courts .
42022001	Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread , which is called the Passover , was approaching .
42022002	The chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find some way to execute Jesus , for they were afraid of the people .
42022003	Then Satan entered Judas , the one called Iscariot , who was one of the twelve .
42022004	He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he might betray Jesus , handing him over to them .
42022005	They were delighted and arranged to give him money .
42022006	So Judas agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present .
42022007	Then the day for the feast of Unleavened Bread came , on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed .
42022008	Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat . ”
42022009	They said to him , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
42022010	He said to them , “ Listen , when you have entered the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house that he enters ,
42022011	and tell the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher says to you , “ Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? ” ’
42022012	Then he will show you a large furnished room upstairs . Make preparations there . ”
42022013	So they went and found things just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
42022014	Now when the hour came , Jesus took his place at the table and the apostles joined him .
42022015	And he said to them , “ I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
42022016	For I tell you , I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God . ”
42022017	Then he took a cup , and after giving thanks he said , “ Take this and divide it among yourselves .
42022018	For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes . ”
42022019	Then he took bread , and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is my body which is given for you . Do this in remembrance of me . ”
42022020	And in the same way he took the cup after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood .
42022021	“ But look , the hand of the one who betrays me is with me on the table .
42022022	For the Son of Man is to go just as it has been determined , but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed ! ”
42022023	So they began to question one another as to which of them it could possibly be who would do this .
42022024	A dispute also started among them over which of them was to be regarded as the greatest .
42022025	So Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them , and those in authority over them are called ‘ benefactors . ’
42022026	Not so with you ; instead the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest , and the leader like the one who serves .
42022027	For who is greater , the one who is seated at the table , or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who is seated at the table ? But I am among you as one who serves .
42022028	“ You are the ones who have remained with me in my trials .
42022029	Thus I grant to you a kingdom , just as my Father granted to me ,
42022030	that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	“ Simon , Simon , pay attention ! Satan has demanded to have you all , to sift you like wheat ,
42022032	but I have prayed for you , Simon , that your faith may not fail . When you have turned back , strengthen your brothers . ”
42022033	But Peter said to him , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death ! ”
42022034	Jesus replied , “ I tell you , Peter , the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me . ”
42022035	Then Jesus said to them , “ When I sent you out with no money bag , or traveler’s bag , or sandals , you didn’t lack anything , did you ? ” They replied , “ Nothing . ”
42022036	He said to them , “ But now , the one who has a money bag must take it , and likewise a traveler’s bag too . And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one .
42022037	For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me , ‘ And he was counted with the transgressors . ’ For what is written about me is being fulfilled . ”
42022038	So they said , “ Look , Lord , here are two swords . ” Then he told them , “ It is enough . ”
42022039	Then Jesus went out and made his way , as he customarily did , to the Mount of Olives , and the disciples followed him .
42022040	When he came to the place , he said to them , “ Pray that you will not fall into temptation . ”
42022041	He went away from them about a stone’s throw , knelt down , and prayed ,
42022042	“ Father , if you are willing , take this cup away from me . Yet not my will but yours be done . ” [
42022043	Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him .
42022044	And in his anguish he prayed more earnestly , and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground . ]
42022045	When he got up from prayer , he came to the disciples and found them sleeping , exhausted from grief .
42022046	So he said to them , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray that you will not fall into temptation ! ”
42022047	While he was still speaking , suddenly a crowd appeared , and the man named Judas , one of the twelve , was leading them . He walked up to Jesus to kiss him .
42022048	But Jesus said to him , “ Judas , would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
42022049	When those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said , “ Lord , should we use our swords ? ”
42022050	Then one of them struck the high priest’s slave , cutting off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus said , “ Enough of this ! ” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to the chief priests , the officers of the temple guard , and the elders who had come out to get him , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs like you would against an outlaw ?
42022053	Day after day when I was with you in the temple courts , you did not arrest me . But this is your hour , and that of the power of darkness ! ”
42022054	Then they arrested Jesus , led him away , and brought him into the high priest’s house . But Peter was following at a distance .
42022055	When they had made a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together , Peter sat down among them .
42022056	Then a slave girl , seeing him as he sat in the firelight , stared at him and said , “ This man was with him too ! ”
42022057	But Peter denied it : “ Woman , I don’t know him ! ”
42022058	Then a little later someone else saw him and said , “ You are one of them too . ” But Peter said , “ Man , I am not ! ”
42022059	And after about an hour still another insisted , “ Certainly this man was with him , because he too is a Galilean . ”
42022060	But Peter said , “ Man , I don’t know what you’re talking about ! ” At that moment , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42022061	Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter , and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said to him , “ Before a rooster crows today , you will deny me three times . ”
42022062	And he went outside and wept bitterly .
42022063	Now the men who were holding Jesus under guard began to mock him and beat him .
42022064	They blindfolded him and asked him repeatedly , “ Prophesy ! Who hit you ? ”
42022065	They also said many other things against him , reviling him .
42022066	When day came , the council of the elders of the people gathered together , both the chief priests and the experts in the law . Then they led Jesus away to their council
42022067	and said , “ If you are the Christ , tell us . ” But he said to them , “ If I tell you , you will not believe ,
42022068	and if I ask you , you will not answer .
42022069	But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . ”
42022070	So they all said , “ Are you the Son of God , then ? ” He answered them , “ You say that I am . ”
42022071	Then they said , “ Why do we need further testimony ? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips ! ”
42023001	Then the whole group of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate .
42023002	They began to accuse him , saying , “ We found this man subverting our nation , forbidding us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar and claiming that he himself is Christ , a king . ”
42023003	So Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” He replied , “ You say so . ”
42023004	Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , “ I find no basis for an accusation against this man . ”
42023005	But they persisted in saying , “ He incites the people by teaching throughout all Judea . It started in Galilee and ended up here ! ”
42023006	Now when Pilate heard this , he asked whether the man was a Galilean .
42023007	When he learned that he was from Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent him over to Herod , who also happened to be in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	When Herod saw Jesus , he was very glad , for he had long desired to see him , because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some miraculous sign .
42023009	So Herod questioned him at considerable length ; Jesus gave him no answer .
42023010	The chief priests and the experts in the law were there , vehemently accusing him .
42023011	Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him . Then , dressing him in elegant clothes , Herod sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	That very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other , for prior to this they had been enemies .
42023013	Then Pilate called together the chief priests , the rulers , and the people ,
42023014	and said to them , “ You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people . When I examined him before you , I did not find this man guilty of anything you accused him of doing .
42023015	Neither did Herod , for he sent him back to us . Look , he has done nothing deserving death .
42023016	I will therefore have him flogged and release him . ”
42023018	But they all shouted out together , “ Take this man away ! Release Barabbas for us ! ”
42023019	( This was a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city , and for murder . )
42023020	Pilate addressed them once again because he wanted to release Jesus .
42023021	But they kept on shouting , “ Crucify , crucify him ! ”
42023022	A third time he said to them , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? I have found him guilty of no crime deserving death . I will therefore flog him and release him . ”
42023023	But they were insistent , demanding with loud shouts that he be crucified . And their shouts prevailed .
42023024	So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted .
42023025	He released the man they asked for , who had been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder . But he handed Jesus over to their will .
42023026	As they led him away , they seized Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country . They placed the cross on his back and made him carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	A great number of the people followed him , among them women who were mourning and wailing for him .
42023028	But Jesus turned to them and said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	For this is certain : The days are coming when they will say , ‘ Blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore children , and the breasts that never nursed ! ’
42023030	Then they will begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’
42023031	For if such things are done when the wood is green , what will happen when it is dry ? ”
42023032	Two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him .
42023033	So when they came to the place that is called “ The Skull , ” they crucified him there , along with the criminals , one on his right and one on his left .
42023034	[ But Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them , for they don’t know what they are doing . ” ] Then they threw dice to divide his clothes .
42023035	The people also stood there watching , but the rulers ridiculed him , saying , “ He saved others . Let him save himself if he is the Christ of God , his chosen one ! ”
42023036	The soldiers also mocked him , coming up and offering him sour wine ,
42023037	and saying , “ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
42023038	There was also an inscription over him , “ This is the king of the Jews . ”
42023039	One of the criminals who was hanging there railed at him , saying , “ Aren’t you the Christ ? Save yourself and us ! ”
42023040	But the other rebuked him , saying , “ Don’t you fear God , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ?
42023041	And we rightly so , for we are getting what we deserve for what we did , but this man has done nothing wrong . ”
42023042	Then he said , “ Jesus , remember me when you come in your kingdom . ”
42023043	And Jesus said to him , “ I tell you the truth , today you will be with me in paradise . ”
42023044	It was now about noon , and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon ,
42023045	because the sun’s light failed . The temple curtain was torn in two .
42023046	Then Jesus , calling out with a loud voice , said , “ Father , into your hands I commit my spirit ! ” And after he said this he breathed his last .
42023047	Now when the centurion saw what had happened , he praised God and said , “ Certainly this man was innocent ! ”
42023048	And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle , when they saw what had taken place , returned home beating their breasts .
42023049	And all those who knew Jesus stood at a distance , and the women who had followed him from Galilee saw these things .
42023050	Now there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the council , a good and righteous man .
42023051	( He had not consented to their plan and action . ) He was from the Judean town of Arimathea , and was looking forward to the kingdom of God .
42023052	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42023053	Then he took it down , wrapped it in a linen cloth , and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock , where no one had yet been buried .
42023054	It was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was beginning .
42023055	The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed , and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it .
42023056	Then they returned and prepared aromatic spices and perfumes . On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment .
42024001	Now on the first day of the week , at early dawn , the women went to the tomb , taking the aromatic spices they had prepared .
42024002	They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb ,
42024003	but when they went in , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	While they were perplexed about this , suddenly two men stood beside them in dazzling attire .
42024005	The women were terribly frightened and bowed their faces to the ground , but the men said to them , “ Why do you look for the living among the dead ?
42024006	He is not here , but has been raised ! Remember how he told you , while he was still in Galilee ,
42024007	that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and on the third day rise again . ”
42024008	Then the women remembered his words ,
42024009	and when they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
42024010	Now it was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles .
42024011	But these words seemed like pure nonsense to them , and they did not believe them .
42024012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . He bent down and saw only the strips of linen cloth ; then he went home , wondering what had happened .
42024013	Now that very day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	They were talking to each other about all the things that had happened .
42024015	While they were talking and debating these things , Jesus himself approached and began to accompany them
42024016	( but their eyes were kept from recognizing him ) .
42024017	Then he said to them , “ What are these matters you are discussing so intently as you walk along ? ” And they stood still , looking sad .
42024018	Then one of them , named Cleopas , answered him , “ Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that have happened there in these days ? ”
42024019	He said to them , “ What things ? ” “ The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene , ” they replied , “ a man who , with his powerful deeds and words , proved to be a prophet before God and all the people ;
42024020	and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
42024021	But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel . Not only this , but it is now the third day since these things happened .
42024022	Furthermore , some women of our group amazed us . They were at the tomb early this morning ,
42024023	and when they did not find his body , they came back and said they had seen a vision of angels , who said he was alive .
42024024	Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb , and found it just as the women had said , but they did not see him . ”
42024025	So he said to them , “ You foolish people – how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken !
42024026	Wasn’t it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory ? ”
42024027	Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets , he interpreted to them the things written about himself in all the scriptures .
42024028	So they approached the village where they were going . He acted as though he wanted to go farther ,
42024029	but they urged him , “ Stay with us , because it is getting toward evening and the day is almost done . ” So he went in to stay with them .
42024030	When he had taken his place at the table with them , he took the bread , blessed and broke it , and gave it to them .
42024031	At this point their eyes were opened and they recognized him . Then he vanished out of their sight .
42024032	They said to each other , “ Didn’t our hearts burn within us while he was speaking with us on the road , while he was explaining the scriptures to us ? ”
42024033	So they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem . They found the eleven and those with them gathered together
42024034	and saying , “ The Lord has really risen , and has appeared to Simon ! ”
42024035	Then they told what had happened on the road , and how they recognized him when he broke the bread .
42024036	While they were saying these things , Jesus himself stood among them and said to them , “ Peace be with you . ”
42024037	But they were startled and terrified , thinking they saw a ghost .
42024038	Then he said to them , “ Why are you frightened , and why do doubts arise in your hearts ?
42024039	Look at my hands and my feet ; it’s me ! Touch me and see ; a ghost does not have flesh and bones like you see I have . ”
42024040	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
42024041	And while they still could not believe it ( because of their joy ) and were amazed , he said to them , “ Do you have anything here to eat ? ”
42024042	So they gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
42024043	and he took it and ate it in front of them .
42024044	Then he said to them , “ These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you , that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled . ”
42024045	Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures ,
42024046	and said to them , “ Thus it stands written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day ,
42024047	and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And look , I am sending you what my Father promised . But stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high . ”
42024050	Then Jesus led them out as far as Bethany , and lifting up his hands , he blessed them .
42024051	Now during the blessing he departed and was taken up into heaven .
42024052	So they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
42024053	and were continually in the temple courts blessing God .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was fully God .
43001002	The Word was with God in the beginning .
43001003	All things were created by him , and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created .
43001004	In him was life , and the life was the light of mankind .
43001005	And the light shines on in the darkness , but the darkness has not mastered it .
43001006	A man came , sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	He came as a witness to testify about the light , so that everyone might believe through him .
43001008	He himself was not the light , but he came to testify about the light .
43001009	The true light , who gives light to everyone , was coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and the world was created by him , but the world did not recognize him .
43001011	He came to what was his own , but his own people did not receive him .
43001012	But to all who have received him – those who believe in his name – he has given the right to become God’s children
43001013	– children not born by human parents or by human desire or a husband’s decision , but by God .
43001014	Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us . We saw his glory – the glory of the one and only , full of grace and truth , who came from the Father .
43001015	John testified about him and shouted out , “ This one was the one about whom I said , ‘ He who comes after me is greater than I am , because he existed before me . ’ ”
43001016	For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another .
43001017	For the law was given through Moses , but grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God . The only one , himself God , who is in closest fellowship with the Father , has made God known .
43001019	Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
43001020	He confessed – he did not deny but confessed – “ I am not the Christ ! ”
43001021	So they asked him , “ Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” He said , “ I am not ! ” “ Are you the Prophet ? ” He answered , “ No ! ”
43001022	Then they said to him , “ Who are you ? Tell us so that we can give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
43001023	John said , “ I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Make straight the way for the Lord , ’ as Isaiah the prophet said . ”
43001024	( Now they had been sent from the Pharisees . )
43001025	So they asked John , “ Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? ”
43001026	John answered them , “ I baptize with water . Among you stands one whom you do not recognize ,
43001027	who is coming after me . I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal ! ”
43001028	These things happened in Bethany across the Jordan River where John was baptizing .
43001029	On the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said , “ Look , the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is the one about whom I said , ‘ After me comes a man who is greater than I am , because he existed before me . ’
43001031	I did not recognize him , but I came baptizing with water so that he could be revealed to Israel . ”
43001032	Then John testified , “ I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven , and it remained on him .
43001033	And I did not recognize him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me , ‘ The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining – this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . ’
43001034	I have both seen and testified that this man is the Chosen One of God . ”
43001035	Again the next day John was standing there with two of his disciples .
43001036	Gazing at Jesus as he walked by , he said , “ Look , the Lamb of God ! ”
43001037	When John’s two disciples heard him say this , they followed Jesus .
43001038	Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them , “ What do you want ? ” So they said to him , “ Rabbi ” ( which is translated Teacher ) , “ where are you staying ? ”
43001039	Jesus answered , “ Come and you will see . ” So they came and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day . Now it was about four o’clock in the afternoon .
43001040	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus .
43001041	He first found his own brother Simon and told him , “ We have found the Messiah ! ” ( which is translated Christ ) .
43001042	Andrew brought Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon , the son of John . You will be called Cephas ” ( which is translated Peter ) .
43001043	On the next day Jesus wanted to set out for Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow me . ”
43001044	( Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the town of Andrew and Peter . )
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law , and the prophets also wrote about – Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . ”
43001046	Nathanael replied , “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ” Philip replied , “ Come and see . ”
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and exclaimed , “ Look , a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit ! ”
43001048	Nathanael asked him , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus replied , “ Before Philip called you , when you were under the fig tree , I saw you . ”
43001049	Nathanael answered him , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God ; you are the king of Israel ! ”
43001050	Jesus said to him , “ Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree , do you believe ? You will see greater things than these . ”
43001051	He continued , “ I tell all of you the solemn truth – you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . ”
43002001	Now on the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee . Jesus’ mother was there ,
43002002	and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding .
43002003	When the wine ran out , Jesus’ mother said to him , “ They have no wine left . ”
43002004	Jesus replied , “ Woman , why are you saying this to me ? My time has not yet come . ”
43002005	His mother told the servants , “ Whatever he tells you , do it . ”
43002006	Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing , each holding twenty or thirty gallons .
43002007	Jesus told the servants , “ Fill the water jars with water . ” So they filled them up to the very top .
43002008	Then he told them , “ Now draw some out and take it to the head steward , ” and they did .
43002009	When the head steward tasted the water that had been turned to wine , not knowing where it came from ( though the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , he called the bridegroom
43002010	and said to him , “ Everyone serves the good wine first , and then the cheaper wine when the guests are drunk . You have kept the good wine until now ! ”
43002011	Jesus did this as the first of his miraculous signs , in Cana of Galilee . In this way he revealed his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples , and they stayed there a few days .
43002013	Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near , so Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	He found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the money changers sitting at tables .
43002015	So he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts , with the sheep and the oxen . He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables .
43002016	To those who sold the doves he said , “ Take these things away from here ! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace ! ”
43002017	His disciples remembered that it was written , “ Zeal for your house will devour me . ”
43002018	So then the Jewish leaders responded , “ What sign can you show us , since you are doing these things ? ”
43002019	Jesus replied , “ Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again . ”
43002020	Then the Jewish leaders said to him , “ This temple has been under construction for forty-six years , and are you going to raise it up in three days ? ”
43002021	But Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body .
43002022	So after he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this , and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken .
43002023	Now while Jesus was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover , many people believed in his name because they saw the miraculous signs he was doing .
43002024	But Jesus would not entrust himself to them , because he knew all people .
43002025	He did not need anyone to testify about man , for he knew what was in man .
43003001	Now a certain man , a Pharisee named Nicodemus , who was a member of the Jewish ruling council ,
43003002	came to Jesus at night and said to him , “ Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher who has come from God . For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him . ”
43003003	Jesus replied , “ I tell you the solemn truth , unless a person is born from above , he cannot see the kingdom of God . ”
43003004	Nicodemus said to him , “ How can a man be born when he is old ? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time , can he ? ”
43003005	Jesus answered , “ I tell you the solemn truth , unless a person is born of water and spirit , he cannot enter the kingdom of God .
43003006	What is born of the flesh is flesh , and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Do not be amazed that I said to you , ‘ You must all be born from above . ’
43003008	The wind blows wherever it will , and you hear the sound it makes , but do not know where it comes from and where it is going . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit . ”
43003009	Nicodemus replied , “ How can these things be ? ”
43003010	Jesus answered , “ Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don’t understand these things ?
43003011	I tell you the solemn truth , we speak about what we know and testify about what we have seen , but you people do not accept our testimony .
43003012	If I have told you people about earthly things and you don’t believe , how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven – the Son of Man .
43003014	Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
43003015	so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life . ”
43003016	For this is the way God loved the world : He gave his one and only Son , so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world should be saved through him .
43003018	The one who believes in him is not condemned . The one who does not believe has been condemned already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
43003019	Now this is the basis for judging : that the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light , because their deeds were evil .
43003020	For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light , so that their deeds will not be exposed .
43003021	But the one who practices the truth comes to the light , so that it may be plainly evident that his deeds have been done in God .
43003022	After this , Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory , and there he spent time with them and was baptizing .
43003023	John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because water was plentiful there , and people were coming to him and being baptized .
43003024	( For John had not yet been thrown into prison . )
43003025	Now a dispute came about between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew concerning ceremonial washing .
43003026	So they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River , about whom you testified – see , he is baptizing , and everyone is flocking to him ! ”
43003027	John replied , “ No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves can testify that I said , ‘ I am not the Christ , ’ but rather , ‘ I have been sent before him . ’
43003029	The one who has the bride is the bridegroom . The friend of the bridegroom , who stands by and listens for him , rejoices greatly when he hears the bridegroom’s voice . This then is my joy , and it is complete .
43003030	He must become more important while I become less important . ”
43003031	The one who comes from above is superior to all . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things . The one who comes from heaven is superior to all .
43003032	He testifies about what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts his testimony .
43003033	The one who has accepted his testimony has confirmed clearly that God is truthful .
43003034	For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for he does not give the Spirit sparingly .
43003035	The Father loves the Son and has placed all things under his authority .
43003036	The one who believes in the Son has eternal life . The one who rejects the Son will not see life , but God’s wrath remains on him .
43004001	Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more disciples than John
43004002	( although Jesus himself was not baptizing , but his disciples were ) ,
43004003	he left Judea and set out once more for Galilee .
43004004	But he had to pass through Samaria .
43004005	Now he came to a Samaritan town called Sychar , near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob’s well was there , so Jesus , since he was tired from the journey , sat right down beside the well . It was about noon .
43004007	A Samaritan woman came to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give me some water to drink . ”
43004008	( For his disciples had gone off into the town to buy supplies . )
43004009	So the Samaritan woman said to him , “ How can you – a Jew – ask me , a Samaritan woman , for water to drink ? ” ( For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans . )
43004010	Jesus answered her , “ If you had known the gift of God and who it is who said to you , ‘ Give me some water to drink , ’ you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . ”
43004011	“ Sir , ” the woman said to him , “ you have no bucket and the well is deep ; where then do you get this living water ?
43004012	Surely you’re not greater than our ancestor Jacob , are you ? For he gave us this well and drank from it himself , along with his sons and his livestock . ”
43004013	Jesus replied , “ Everyone who drinks some of this water will be thirsty again .
43004014	But whoever drinks some of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again , but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life . ”
43004015	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water , so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water . ”
43004016	He said to her , “ Go call your husband and come back here . ”
43004017	The woman replied , “ I have no husband . ” Jesus said to her , “ Right you are when you said , ‘ I have no husband , ’
43004018	for you have had five husbands , and the man you are living with now is not your husband . This you said truthfully ! ”
43004019	The woman said to him , “ Sir , I see that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , and you people say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem . ”
43004021	Jesus said to her , “ Believe me , woman , a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
43004022	You people worship what you do not know . We worship what we know , because salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	But a time is coming – and now is here – when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers .
43004024	God is spirit , and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . ”
43004025	The woman said to him , “ I know that Messiah is coming ” ( the one called Christ ) ; “ whenever he comes , he will tell us everything . ”
43004026	Jesus said to her , “ I , the one speaking to you , am he . ”
43004027	Now at that very moment his disciples came back . They were shocked because he was speaking with a woman . However , no one said , “ What do you want ? ” or “ Why are you speaking with her ? ”
43004028	Then the woman left her water jar , went off into the town and said to the people ,
43004029	“ Come , see a man who told me everything I ever did . Surely he can’t be the Messiah , can he ? ”
43004030	So they left the town and began coming to him .
43004031	Meanwhile the disciples were urging him , “ Rabbi , eat something . ”
43004032	But he said to them , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about . ”
43004033	So the disciples began to say to one another , “ No one brought him anything to eat , did they ? ”
43004034	Jesus said to them , “ My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to complete his work .
43004035	Don’t you say , ‘ There are four more months and then comes the harvest ? ’ I tell you , look up and see that the fields are already white for harvest !
43004036	The one who reaps receives pay and gathers fruit for eternal life , so that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together .
43004037	For in this instance the saying is true , ‘ One sows and another reaps . ’
43004038	I sent you to reap what you did not work for ; others have labored and you have entered into their labor . ”
43004039	Now many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the report of the woman who testified , “ He told me everything I ever did . ”
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to him , they began asking him to stay with them . He stayed there two days ,
43004041	and because of his word many more believed .
43004042	They said to the woman , “ No longer do we believe because of your words , for we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this one really is the Savior of the world . ”
43004043	After the two days he departed from there to Galilee .
43004044	( For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country . )
43004045	So when he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast ( for they themselves had gone to the feast ) .
43004046	Now he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine . In Capernaum there was a certain royal official whose son was sick .
43004047	When he heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee , he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son , who was about to die .
43004048	So Jesus said to him , “ Unless you people see signs and wonders you will never believe ! ”
43004049	“ Sir , ” the official said to him , “ come down before my child dies . ”
43004050	Jesus told him , “ Go home ; your son will live . ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and set off for home .
43004051	While he was on his way down , his slaves met him and told him that his son was going to live .
43004052	So he asked them the time when his condition began to improve , and they told him , “ Yesterday at one o’clock in the afternoon the fever left him . ”
43004053	Then the father realized that it was the very time Jesus had said to him , “ Your son will live , ” and he himself believed along with his entire household .
43004054	Jesus did this as his second miraculous sign when he returned from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	After this there was a Jewish feast , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool called Bethzatha in Aramaic , which has five covered walkways .
43005003	A great number of sick , blind , lame , and paralyzed people were lying in these walkways .
43005005	Now a man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw him lying there and when he realized that the man had been disabled a long time already , he said to him , “ Do you want to become well ? ”
43005007	The sick man answered him , “ Sir , I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up . While I am trying to get into the water , someone else goes down there before me . ”
43005008	Jesus said to him , “ Stand up ! Pick up your mat and walk . ”
43005009	Immediately the man was healed , and he picked up his mat and started walking . ( Now that day was a Sabbath . )
43005010	So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed , “ It is the Sabbath , and you are not permitted to carry your mat . ”
43005011	But he answered them , “ The man who made me well said to me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk . ’ ”
43005012	They asked him , “ Who is the man who said to you , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk ’ ? ”
43005013	But the man who had been healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had slipped out , since there was a crowd in that place .
43005014	After this Jesus found him at the temple and said to him , “ Look , you have become well . Don’t sin any more , lest anything worse happen to you . ”
43005015	The man went away and informed the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the one who had made him well .
43005016	Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath , the Jewish leaders began persecuting him .
43005017	So he told them , “ My Father is working until now , and I too am working . ”
43005018	For this reason the Jewish leaders were trying even harder to kill him , because not only was he breaking the Sabbath , but he was also calling God his own Father , thus making himself equal with God .
43005019	So Jesus answered them , “ I tell you the solemn truth , the Son can do nothing on his own initiative , but only what he sees the Father doing . For whatever the Father does , the Son does likewise .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does , and will show him greater deeds than these , so that you will be amazed .
43005021	For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes .
43005022	Furthermore , the Father does not judge anyone , but has assigned all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	so that all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father . The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
43005024	“ I tell you the solemn truth , the one who hears my message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned , but has crossed over from death to life .
43005025	I tell you the solemn truth , a time is coming – and is now here – when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear will live .
43005026	For just as the Father has life in himself , thus he has granted the Son to have life in himself ,
43005027	and he has granted the Son authority to execute judgment , because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	“ Do not be amazed at this , because a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
43005029	and will come out – the ones who have done what is good to the resurrection resulting in life , and the ones who have done what is evil to the resurrection resulting in condemnation .
43005030	I can do nothing on my own initiative . Just as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is just , because I do not seek my own will , but the will of the one who sent me .
43005031	“ If I testify about myself , my testimony is not true .
43005032	There is another who testifies about me , and I know the testimony he testifies about me is true .
43005033	You have sent to John , and he has testified to the truth .
43005034	( I do not accept human testimony , but I say this so that you may be saved . )
43005035	He was a lamp that was burning and shining , and you wanted to rejoice greatly for a short time in his light .
43005036	“ But I have a testimony greater than that from John . For the deeds that the Father has assigned me to complete – the deeds I am now doing – testify about me that the Father has sent me .
43005037	And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me . You people have never heard his voice nor seen his form at any time ,
43005038	nor do you have his word residing in you , because you do not believe the one whom he sent .
43005039	You study the scriptures thoroughly because you think in them you possess eternal life , and it is these same scriptures that testify about me ,
43005040	but you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life .
43005041	“ I do not accept praise from people ,
43005042	but I know you , that you do not have the love of God within you .
43005043	I have come in my Father’s name , and you do not accept me . If someone else comes in his own name , you will accept him .
43005044	How can you believe , if you accept praise from one another and don’t seek the praise that comes from the only God ?
43005045	“ Do not suppose that I will accuse you before the Father . The one who accuses you is Moses , in whom you have placed your hope .
43005046	If you believed Moses , you would believe me , because he wrote about me .
43005047	But if you do not believe what Moses wrote , how will you believe my words ? ”
43006001	After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee ( also called the Sea of Tiberias ) .
43006002	A large crowd was following him because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing on the sick .
43006003	So Jesus went on up the mountainside and sat down there with his disciples .
43006004	( Now the Jewish feast of the Passover was near . )
43006005	Then Jesus , when he looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming to him , said to Philip , “ Where can we buy bread so that these people may eat ? ”
43006006	( Now Jesus said this to test him , for he knew what he was going to do . )
43006007	Philip replied , “ Two hundred silver coins worth of bread would not be enough for them , for each one to get a little . ”
43006008	One of Jesus’ disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , said to him ,
43006009	“ Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish , but what good are these for so many people ? ”
43006010	Jesus said , “ Have the people sit down . ” ( Now there was a lot of grass in that place . ) So the men sat down , about five thousand in number .
43006011	Then Jesus took the loaves , and when he had given thanks , he distributed the bread to those who were seated . He then did the same with the fish , as much as they wanted .
43006012	When they were all satisfied , Jesus said to his disciples , “ Gather up the broken pieces that are left over , so that nothing is wasted . ”
43006013	So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves left over by the people who had eaten .
43006014	Now when the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus performed , they began to say to one another , “ This is certainly the Prophet who is to come into the world . ”
43006015	Then Jesus , because he knew they were going to come and seize him by force to make him king , withdrew again up the mountainside alone .
43006016	Now when evening came , his disciples went down to the lake ,
43006017	got into a boat , and started to cross the lake to Capernaum . ( It had already become dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them . )
43006018	By now a strong wind was blowing and the sea was getting rough .
43006019	Then , when they had rowed about three or four miles , they caught sight of Jesus walking on the lake , approaching the boat , and they were frightened .
43006020	But he said to them , “ It is I . Do not be afraid . ”
43006021	Then they wanted to take him into the boat , and immediately the boat came to the land where they had been heading .
43006022	The next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the lake realized that only one small boat had been there , and that Jesus had not boarded it with his disciples , but that his disciples had gone away alone .
43006023	But some boats from Tiberias came to shore near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	So when the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they got into the boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
43006025	When they found him on the other side of the lake , they said to him , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
43006026	Jesus replied , “ I tell you the solemn truth , you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs , but because you ate all the loaves of bread you wanted .
43006027	Do not work for the food that disappears , but for the food that remains to eternal life – the food which the Son of Man will give to you . For God the Father has put his seal of approval on him . ”
43006028	So then they said to him , “ What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires ? ”
43006029	Jesus replied , “ This is the deed God requires – to believe in the one whom he sent . ”
43006030	So they said to him , “ Then what miraculous sign will you perform , so that we may see it and believe you ? What will you do ?
43006031	Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness , just as it is written , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
43006032	Then Jesus told them , “ I tell you the solemn truth , it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven , but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
43006034	So they said to him , “ Sir , give us this bread all the time ! ”
43006035	Jesus said to them , “ I am the bread of life . The one who comes to me will never go hungry , and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty .
43006036	But I told you that you have seen me and still do not believe .
43006037	Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me , and the one who comes to me I will never send away .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me .
43006039	Now this is the will of the one who sent me – that I should not lose one person of every one he has given me , but raise them all up at the last day .
43006040	For this is the will of my Father – for everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him to have eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day . ”
43006041	Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began complaining about him because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven , ”
43006042	and they said , “ Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How can he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
43006043	Jesus replied , “ Do not complain about me to one another .
43006044	No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him , and I will raise him up at the last day .
43006045	It is written in the prophets , ‘ And they will all be taught by God . ’ Everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to me .
43006046	( Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God – he has seen the Father . )
43006047	I tell you the solemn truth , the one who believes has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
43006050	This is the bread that has come down from heaven , so that a person may eat from it and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . If anyone eats from this bread he will live forever . The bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh . ”
43006052	Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began to argue with one another , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
43006053	Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the solemn truth , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you have no life in yourselves .
43006054	The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
43006056	The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me , and I in him .
43006057	Just as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so the one who consumes me will live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread that came down from heaven ; it is not like the bread your ancestors ate , but then later died . The one who eats this bread will live forever . ”
43006059	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	Then many of his disciples , when they heard these things , said , “ This is a difficult saying ! Who can understand it ? ”
43006061	When Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining about this , he said to them , “ Does this cause you to be offended ?
43006062	Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before ?
43006063	The Spirit is the one who gives life ; human nature is of no help ! The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life .
43006064	But there are some of you who do not believe . ” ( For Jesus had already known from the beginning who those were who did not believe , and who it was who would betray him . )
43006065	So Jesus added , “ Because of this I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has allowed him to come . ”
43006066	After this many of his disciples quit following him and did not accompany him any longer .
43006067	So Jesus said to the twelve , “ You don’t want to go away too , do you ? ”
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , to whom would we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
43006069	We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God ! ”
43006070	Jesus replied , “ Didn’t I choose you , the twelve , and yet one of you is the devil ? ”
43006071	( Now he said this about Judas son of Simon Iscariot , for Judas , one of the twelve , was going to betray him . )
43007001	After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee . He stayed out of Judea because the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him .
43007002	Now the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near .
43007003	So Jesus’ brothers advised him , “ Leave here and go to Judea so your disciples may see your miracles that you are performing .
43007004	For no one who seeks to make a reputation for himself does anything in secret . If you are doing these things , show yourself to the world . ”
43007005	( For not even his own brothers believed in him . )
43007006	So Jesus replied , “ My time has not yet arrived , but you are ready at any opportunity !
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates me , because I am testifying about it that its deeds are evil .
43007008	You go up to the feast yourselves . I am not going up to this feast because my time has not yet fully arrived . ”
43007009	When he had said this , he remained in Galilee .
43007010	But when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then Jesus himself also went up , not openly but in secret .
43007011	So the Jewish leaders were looking for him at the feast , asking , “ Where is he ? ”
43007012	There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds . Some were saying , “ He is a good man , ” but others , “ He deceives the common people . ”
43007013	However , no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jewish leaders .
43007014	When the feast was half over , Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach .
43007015	Then the Jewish leaders were astonished and said , “ How does this man know so much when he has never had formal instruction ? ”
43007016	So Jesus replied , “ My teaching is not from me , but from the one who sent me .
43007017	If anyone wants to do God’s will , he will know about my teaching , whether it is from God or whether I speak from my own authority .
43007018	The person who speaks on his own authority desires to receive honor for himself ; the one who desires the honor of the one who sent him is a man of integrity , and there is no unrighteousness in him .
43007019	Hasn’t Moses given you the law ? Yet not one of you keeps the law ! Why do you want to kill me ? ”
43007020	The crowd answered , “ You’re possessed by a demon ! Who is trying to kill you ? ”
43007021	Jesus replied , “ I performed one miracle and you are all amazed .
43007022	However , because Moses gave you the practice of circumcision ( not that it came from Moses , but from the forefathers ) , you circumcise a male child on the Sabbath .
43007023	But if a male child is circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken , why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Do not judge according to external appearance , but judge with proper judgment . ”
43007025	Then some of the residents of Jerusalem began to say , “ Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill ?
43007026	Yet here he is , speaking publicly , and they are saying nothing to him . Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ ?
43007027	But we know where this man comes from . Whenever the Christ comes , no one will know where he comes from . ”
43007028	Then Jesus , while teaching in the temple courts , cried out , “ You both know me and know where I come from ! And I have not come on my own initiative , but the one who sent me is true . You do not know him ,
43007029	but I know him , because I have come from him and he sent me . ”
43007030	So then they tried to seize Jesus , but no one laid a hand on him , because his time had not yet come .
43007031	Yet many of the crowd believed in him and said , “ Whenever the Christ comes , he won’t perform more miraculous signs than this man did , will he ? ”
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Jesus , so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him .
43007033	Then Jesus said , “ I will be with you for only a little while longer , and then I am going to the one who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me but will not find me , and where I am you cannot come . ”
43007035	Then the Jewish leaders said to one another , “ Where is he going to go that we cannot find him ? He is not going to go to the Jewish people dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks , is he ?
43007036	What did he mean by saying , ‘ You will look for me but will not find me , and where I am you cannot come ’ ? ”
43007037	On the last day of the feast , the greatest day , Jesus stood up and shouted out , “ If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me , and
43007038	let the one who believes in me drink . Just as the scripture says , ‘ From within him will flow rivers of living water . ’ ”
43007039	( Now he said this about the Spirit , whom those who believed in him were going to receive , for the Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus was not yet glorified . )
43007040	When they heard these words , some of the crowd began to say , “ This really is the Prophet ! ”
43007041	Others said , “ This is the Christ ! ” But still others said , “ No , for the Christ doesn’t come from Galilee , does he ?
43007042	Don’t the scriptures say that the Christ is a descendant of David and comes from Bethlehem , the village where David lived ? ”
43007043	So there was a division in the crowd because of Jesus .
43007044	Some of them were wanting to seize him , but no one laid a hand on him .
43007045	Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees , who said to them , “ Why didn’t you bring him back with you ? ”
43007046	The officers replied , “ No one ever spoke like this man ! ”
43007047	Then the Pharisees answered , “ You haven’t been deceived too , have you ?
43007048	None of the rulers or the Pharisees have believed in him , have they ?
43007049	But this rabble who do not know the law are accursed ! ”
43007050	Nicodemus , who had gone to Jesus before and who was one of the rulers , said ,
43007051	“ Our law doesn’t condemn a man unless it first hears from him and learns what he is doing , does it ? ”
43007052	They replied , “ You aren’t from Galilee too , are you ? Investigate carefully and you will see that no prophet comes from Galilee ! ” [ [
43007053	And each one departed to his own house .
43008001	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	Early in the morning he came to the temple courts again . All the people came to him , and he sat down and began to teach them .
43008003	The experts in the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught committing adultery . They made her stand in front of them
43008004	and said to Jesus , “ Teacher , this woman was caught in the very act of adultery .
43008005	In the law Moses commanded us to stone to death such women . What then do you say ? ”
43008006	( Now they were asking this in an attempt to trap him , so that they could bring charges against him . ) Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger .
43008007	When they persisted in asking him , he stood up straight and replied , “ Whoever among you is guiltless may be the first to throw a stone at her . ”
43008008	Then he bent over again and wrote on the ground .
43008009	Now when they heard this , they began to drift away one at a time , starting with the older ones , until Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him .
43008010	Jesus stood up straight and said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Did no one condemn you ? ”
43008011	She replied , “ No one , Lord . ” And Jesus said , “ I do not condemn you either . Go , and from now on do not sin any more . ” ] ]
43008012	Then Jesus spoke out again , “ I am the light of the world . The one who follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . ”
43008013	So the Pharisees objected , “ You testify about yourself ; your testimony is not true ! ”
43008014	Jesus answered , “ Even if I testify about myself , my testimony is true , because I know where I came from and where I am going . But you people do not know where I came from or where I am going .
43008015	You people judge by outward appearances ; I do not judge anyone .
43008016	But if I judge , my evaluation is accurate , because I am not alone when I judge , but I and the Father who sent me do so together .
43008017	It is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true .
43008018	I testify about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me . ”
43008019	Then they began asking him , “ Who is your father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You do not know either me or my Father . If you knew me you would know my Father too . ”
43008020	( Jesus spoke these words near the offering box while he was teaching in the temple courts . No one seized him because his time had not yet come . )
43008021	Then Jesus said to them again , “ I am going away , and you will look for me but will die in your sin . Where I am going you cannot come . ”
43008022	So the Jewish leaders began to say , “ Perhaps he is going to kill himself , because he says , ‘ Where I am going you cannot come . ’ ”
43008023	Jesus replied , “ You people are from below ; I am from above . You people are from this world ; I am not from this world .
43008024	Thus I told you that you will die in your sins . For unless you believe that I am he , you will die in your sins . ”
43008025	So they said to him , “ Who are you ? ” Jesus replied , “ What I have told you from the beginning .
43008026	I have many things to say and to judge about you , but the Father who sent me is truthful , and the things I have heard from him I speak to the world . ”
43008027	( They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father . )
43008028	Then Jesus said , “ When you lift up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing on my own initiative , but I speak just what the Father taught me .
43008029	And the one who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , because I always do those things that please him . ”
43008030	While he was saying these things , many people believed in him .
43008031	Then Jesus said to those Judeans who had believed him , “ If you continue to follow my teaching , you are really my disciples
43008032	and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
43008033	“ We are descendants of Abraham , ” they replied , “ and have never been anyone’s slaves ! How can you say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ”
43008034	Jesus answered them , “ I tell you the solemn truth , everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin .
43008035	The slave does not remain in the family forever , but the son remains forever .
43008036	So if the son sets you free , you will be really free .
43008037	I know that you are Abraham’s descendants . But you want to kill me , because my teaching makes no progress among you .
43008038	I am telling you the things I have seen while with the Father ; as for you , practice the things you have heard from the Father ! ”
43008039	They answered him , “ Abraham is our father ! ” Jesus replied , “ If you are Abraham’s children , you would be doing the deeds of Abraham .
43008040	But now you are trying to kill me , a man who has told you the truth I heard from God . Abraham did not do this !
43008041	You people are doing the deeds of your father . ” Then they said to Jesus , “ We were not born as a result of immorality ! We have only one Father , God himself . ”
43008042	Jesus replied , “ If God were your Father , you would love me , for I have come from God and am now here . I have not come on my own initiative , but he sent me .
43008043	Why don’t you understand what I am saying ? It is because you cannot accept my teaching .
43008044	You people are from your father the devil , and you want to do what your father desires . He was a murderer from the beginning , and does not uphold the truth , because there is no truth in him . Whenever he lies , he speaks according to his own nature , because he is a liar and the father of lies .
43008045	But because I am telling you the truth , you do not believe me .
43008046	Who among you can prove me guilty of any sin ? If I am telling you the truth , why don’t you believe me ?
43008047	The one who belongs to God listens and responds to God’s words . You don’t listen and respond , because you don’t belong to God . ”
43008048	The Judeans replied , “ Aren’t we correct in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon ? ”
43008049	Jesus answered , “ I am not possessed by a demon , but I honor my Father – and yet you dishonor me .
43008050	I am not trying to get praise for myself . There is one who demands it , and he also judges .
43008051	I tell you the solemn truth , if anyone obeys my teaching , he will never see death . ”
43008052	Then the Judeans responded , “ Now we know you’re possessed by a demon ! Both Abraham and the prophets died , and yet you say , ‘ If anyone obeys my teaching , he will never experience death . ’
43008053	You aren’t greater than our father Abraham who died , are you ? And the prophets died too ! Who do you claim to be ? ”
43008054	Jesus replied , “ If I glorify myself , my glory is worthless . The one who glorifies me is my Father , about whom you people say , ‘ He is our God . ’
43008055	Yet you do not know him , but I know him . If I were to say that I do not know him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him , and I obey his teaching .
43008056	Your father Abraham was overjoyed to see my day , and he saw it and was glad . ”
43008057	Then the Judeans replied , “ You are not yet fifty years old ! Have you seen Abraham ? ”
43008058	Jesus said to them , “ I tell you the solemn truth , before Abraham came into existence , I am ! ”
43008059	Then they picked up stones to throw at him , but Jesus hid himself and went out from the temple area .
43009001	Now as Jesus was passing by , he saw a man who had been blind from birth .
43009002	His disciples asked him , “ Rabbi , who committed the sin that caused him to be born blind , this man or his parents ? ”
43009003	Jesus answered , “ Neither this man nor his parents sinned , but he was born blind so that the acts of God may be revealed through what happens to him .
43009004	We must perform the deeds of the one who sent me as long as it is daytime . Night is coming when no one can work .
43009005	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ”
43009006	Having said this , he spat on the ground and made some mud with the saliva . He smeared the mud on the blind man’s eyes
43009007	and said to him , “ Go wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated “ sent ” ) . So the blind man went away and washed , and came back seeing .
43009008	Then the neighbors and the people who had seen him previously as a beggar began saying , “ Is this not the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
43009009	Some people said , “ This is the man ! ” while others said , “ No , but he looks like him . ” The man himself kept insisting , “ I am the one ! ”
43009010	So they asked him , “ How then were you made to see ? ”
43009011	He replied , “ The man called Jesus made mud , smeared it on my eyes and told me , ‘ Go to Siloam and wash . ’ So I went and washed , and was able to see . ”
43009012	They said to him , “ Where is that man ? ” He replied , “ I don’t know . ”
43009013	They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees .
43009014	( Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and caused him to see was a Sabbath . )
43009015	So the Pharisees asked him again how he had gained his sight . He replied , “ He put mud on my eyes and I washed , and now I am able to see . ”
43009016	Then some of the Pharisees began to say , “ This man is not from God , because he does not observe the Sabbath . ” But others said , “ How can a man who is a sinner perform such miraculous signs ? ” Thus there was a division among them .
43009017	So again they asked the man who used to be blind , “ What do you say about him , since he caused you to see ? ” “ He is a prophet , ” the man replied .
43009018	Now the Jewish religious leaders refused to believe that he had really been blind and had gained his sight until at last they summoned the parents of the man who had become able to see .
43009019	They asked the parents , “ Is this your son , whom you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
43009020	So his parents replied , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
43009021	But we do not know how he is now able to see , nor do we know who caused him to see . Ask him , he is a mature adult . He will speak for himself . ”
43009022	( His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders . For the Jewish leaders had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue .
43009023	For this reason his parents said , “ He is a mature adult , ask him . ” )
43009024	Then they summoned the man who used to be blind a second time and said to him , “ Promise before God to tell the truth . We know that this man is a sinner . ”
43009025	He replied , “ I do not know whether he is a sinner . I do know one thing – that although I was blind , now I can see . ”
43009026	Then they said to him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he cause you to see ? ”
43009027	He answered , “ I told you already and you didn’t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? You people don’t want to become his disciples too , do you ? ”
43009028	They heaped insults on him , saying , “ You are his disciple ! We are disciples of Moses !
43009029	We know that God has spoken to Moses ! We do not know where this man comes from ! ”
43009030	The man replied , “ This is a remarkable thing , that you don’t know where he comes from , and yet he caused me to see !
43009031	We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners , but if anyone is devout and does his will , God listens to him .
43009032	Never before has anyone heard of someone causing a man born blind to see .
43009033	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . ”
43009034	They replied , “ You were born completely in sinfulness , and yet you presume to teach us ? ” So they threw him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , so he found the man and said to him , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
43009036	The man replied , “ And who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? ”
43009037	Jesus told him , “ You have seen him ; he is the one speaking with you . ” [
43009038	He said , “ Lord , I believe , ” and he worshiped him .
43009039	Jesus said , ] “ For judgment I have come into this world , so that those who do not see may gain their sight , and the ones who see may become blind . ”
43009040	Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked him , “ We are not blind too , are we ? ”
43009041	Jesus replied , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin , but now because you claim that you can see , your guilt remains . ”
43010001	“ I tell you the solemn truth , the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door , but climbs in some other way , is a thief and a robber .
43010002	The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The doorkeeper opens the door for him , and the sheep hear his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	When he has brought all his own sheep out , he goes ahead of them , and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice .
43010005	They will never follow a stranger , but will run away from him , because they do not recognize the stranger’s voice . ”
43010006	Jesus told them this parable , but they did not understand what he was saying to them .
43010007	So Jesus said to them again , “ I tell you the solemn truth , I am the door for the sheep .
43010008	All who came before me were thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
43010009	I am the door . If anyone enters through me , he will be saved , and will come in and go out , and find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy ; I have come so that they may have life , and may have it abundantly .
43010011	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
43010012	The hired hand , who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep , sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and runs away . So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .
43010013	Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep , he runs away .
43010014	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my own and my own know me –
43010015	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep .
43010016	I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold . I must bring them too , and they will listen to my voice , so that there will be one flock and one shepherd .
43010017	This is why the Father loves me – because I lay down my life , so that I may take it back again .
43010018	No one takes it away from me , but I lay it down of my own free will . I have the authority to lay it down , and I have the authority to take it back again . This commandment I received from my Father . ”
43010019	Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words .
43010020	Many of them were saying , “ He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind ! Why do you listen to him ? ”
43010021	Others said , “ These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon . A demon cannot cause the blind to see , can it ? ”
43010022	Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem .
43010023	It was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico .
43010024	The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked , “ How long will you keep us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . ”
43010025	Jesus replied , “ I told you and you do not believe . The deeds I do in my Father’s name testify about me .
43010026	But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep .
43010027	My sheep listen to my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life , and they will never perish ; no one will snatch them from my hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all , and no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand .
43010030	The Father and I are one . ”
43010031	The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death .
43010032	Jesus said to them , “ I have shown you many good deeds from the Father . For which one of them are you going to stone me ? ”
43010033	The Jewish leaders replied , “ We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy , because you , a man , are claiming to be God . ”
43010034	Jesus answered , “ Is it not written in your law , ‘ I said , you are gods ’ ?
43010035	If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘ gods’ ( and the scripture cannot be broken ) ,
43010036	do you say about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ because I said , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ?
43010037	If I do not perform the deeds of my Father , do not believe me .
43010038	But if I do them , even if you do not believe me , believe the deeds , so that you may come to know and understand that I am in the Father and the Father is in me . ”
43010039	Then they attempted again to seize him , but he escaped their clutches .
43010040	Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time , and he stayed there .
43010041	Many came to him and began to say , “ John performed no miraculous sign , but everything John said about this man was true ! ”
43010042	And many believed in Jesus there .
43011001	Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick . He was from Bethany , the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived .
43011002	( Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
43011003	So the sisters sent a message to Jesus , “ Lord , look , the one you love is sick . ”
43011004	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ This sickness will not lead to death , but to God’s glory , so that the Son of God may be glorified through it . ”
43011005	( Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus . )
43011006	So when he heard that Lazarus was sick , he remained in the place where he was for two more days .
43011007	Then after this , he said to his disciples , “ Let us go to Judea again . ”
43011008	The disciples replied , “ Rabbi , the Jewish leaders were just now trying to stone you to death ! Are you going there again ? ”
43011009	Jesus replied , “ Are there not twelve hours in a day ? If anyone walks around in the daytime , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	But if anyone walks around at night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . ”
43011011	After he said this , he added , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep . But I am going there to awaken him . ”
43011012	Then the disciples replied , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover . ”
43011013	( Now Jesus had been talking about his death , but they thought he had been talking about real sleep . )
43011014	Then Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus has died ,
43011015	and I am glad for your sake that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him . ”
43011016	So Thomas ( called Didymus ) said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us go too , so that we may die with him . ”
43011017	When Jesus arrived , he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already .
43011018	( Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem ,
43011019	so many of the Jewish people of the region had come to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of their brother . )
43011020	So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him , but Mary was sitting in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	But even now I know that whatever you ask from God , God will grant you . ”
43011023	Jesus replied , “ Your brother will come back to life again . ”
43011024	Martha said , “ I know that he will come back to life again in the resurrection at the last day . ”
43011025	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . The one who believes in me will live even if he dies ,
43011026	and the one who lives and believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
43011027	She replied , “ Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God who comes into the world . ”
43011028	And when she had said this , Martha went and called her sister Mary , saying privately , “ The Teacher is here and is asking for you . ”
43011029	So when Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to him .
43011030	( Now Jesus had not yet entered the village , but was still in the place where Martha had come out to meet him . )
43011031	Then the people who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out . They followed her , because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there .
43011032	Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet and said to him , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43011033	When Jesus saw her weeping , and the people who had come with her weeping , he was intensely moved in spirit and greatly distressed .
43011034	He asked , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They replied , “ Lord , come and see . ”
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	Thus the people who had come to mourn said , “ Look how much he loved him ! ”
43011037	But some of them said , “ This is the man who caused the blind man to see ! Couldn’t he have done something to keep Lazarus from dying ? ”
43011038	Jesus , intensely moved again , came to the tomb . ( Now it was a cave , and a stone was placed across it . )
43011039	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone . ” Martha , the sister of the deceased , replied , “ Lord , by this time the body will have a bad smell , because he has been buried four days . ”
43011040	Jesus responded , “ Didn’t I tell you that if you believe , you would see the glory of God ? ”
43011041	So they took away the stone . Jesus looked upward and said , “ Father , I thank you that you have listened to me .
43011042	I knew that you always listen to me , but I said this for the sake of the crowd standing around here , that they may believe that you sent me . ”
43011043	When he had said this , he shouted in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
43011044	The one who had died came out , his feet and hands tied up with strips of cloth , and a cloth wrapped around his face . Jesus said to them , “ Unwrap him and let him go . ”
43011045	Then many of the people , who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did , believed in him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done .
43011047	So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said , “ What are we doing ? For this man is performing many miraculous signs .
43011048	If we allow him to go on in this way , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away our sanctuary and our nation . ”
43011049	Then one of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , said , “ You know nothing at all !
43011050	You do not realize that it is more to your advantage to have one man die for the people than for the whole nation to perish . ”
43011051	( Now he did not say this on his own , but because he was high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation ,
43011052	and not for the Jewish nation only , but to gather together into one the children of God who are scattered . )
43011053	So from that day they planned together to kill him .
43011054	Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans , but went away from there to the region near the wilderness , to a town called Ephraim , and stayed there with his disciples .
43011055	Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near , and many people went up to Jerusalem from the rural areas before the Passover to cleanse themselves ritually .
43011056	Thus they were looking for Jesus , and saying to one another as they stood in the temple courts , “ What do you think ? That he won’t come to the feast ? ”
43011057	( Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it , so that they could arrest him . )
43012001	Then , six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus lived , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012002	So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there . Martha was serving , and Lazarus was among those present at the table with him .
43012003	Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus . She then wiped his feet dry with her hair . ( Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil . )
43012004	But Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples ( the one who was going to betray him ) said ,
43012005	“ Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor ? ”
43012006	( Now Judas said this not because he was concerned about the poor , but because he was a thief . As keeper of the money box , he used to steal what was put into it . )
43012007	So Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . She has kept it for the day of my burial .
43012008	For you will always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me ! ”
43012009	Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there , and so they came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too ,
43012011	for on account of him many of the Jewish people from Jerusalem were going away and believing in Jesus .
43012012	The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
43012013	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him . They began to shout , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! Blessed is the king of Israel ! ”
43012014	Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it , just as it is written ,
43012015	“ Do not be afraid , people of Zion ; look , your king is coming , seated on a donkey ’ s colt ! ”
43012016	( His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written about him and that these things had happened to him . )
43012017	So the crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify about it .
43012018	Because they had heard that Jesus had performed this miraculous sign , the crowd went out to meet him .
43012019	Thus the Pharisees said to one another , “ You see that you can do nothing . Look , the world has run off after him ! ”
43012020	Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up to worship at the feast .
43012021	So these approached Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and requested , “ Sir , we would like to see Jesus . ”
43012022	Philip went and told Andrew , and they both went and told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus replied , “ The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
43012024	I tell you the solemn truth , unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies , it remains by itself alone . But if it dies , it produces much grain .
43012025	The one who loves his life destroys it , and the one who hates his life in this world guards it for eternal life .
43012026	If anyone wants to serve me , he must follow me , and where I am , my servant will be too . If anyone serves me , the Father will honor him .
43012027	“ Now my soul is greatly distressed . And what should I say ? ‘ Father , deliver me from this hour ’ ? No , but for this very reason I have come to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify your name . ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again . ”
43012029	The crowd that stood there and heard the voice said that it had thundered . Others said that an angel had spoken to him .
43012030	Jesus said , “ This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours .
43012031	Now is the judgment of this world ; now the ruler of this world will be driven out .
43012032	And I , when I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all people to myself . ”
43012033	( Now he said this to indicate clearly what kind of death he was going to die . )
43012034	Then the crowd responded , “ We have heard from the law that the Christ will remain forever . How can you say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
43012035	Jesus replied , “ The light is with you for a little while longer . Walk while you have the light , so that the darkness may not overtake you . The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
43012036	While you have the light , believe in the light , so that you may become sons of light . ” When Jesus had said these things , he went away and hid himself from them .
43012037	Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them , they still refused to believe in him ,
43012038	so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled . He said , “ Lord , who has believed our message , and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ”
43012039	For this reason they could not believe , because again Isaiah said ,
43012040	“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart , so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their heart , and turn to me , and I would heal them . ”
43012041	Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ’s glory , and spoke about him .
43012042	Nevertheless , even among the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ , so that they would not be put out of the synagogue .
43012043	For they loved praise from men more than praise from God .
43012044	But Jesus shouted out , “ The one who believes in me does not believe in me , but in the one who sent me ,
43012045	and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me .
43012046	I have come as a light into the world , so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness .
43012047	If anyone hears my words and does not obey them , I do not judge him . For I have not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
43012048	The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge ; the word I have spoken will judge him at the last day .
43012049	For I have not spoken from my own authority , but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me what I should say and what I should speak .
43012050	And I know that his commandment is eternal life . Thus the things I say , I say just as the Father has told me . ”
43013001	Just before the Passover feast , Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father . Having loved his own who were in the world , he now loved them to the very end .
43013002	The evening meal was in progress , and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon’s son , that he should betray Jesus .
43013003	Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him , and that he had come from God and was going back to God ,
43013004	he got up from the meal , removed his outer clothes , took a towel and tied it around himself .
43013005	He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself .
43013006	Then he came to Simon Peter . Peter said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
43013007	Jesus replied , “ You do not understand what I am doing now , but you will understand after these things . ”
43013008	Peter said to him , “ You will never wash my feet ! ” Jesus replied , “ If I do not wash you , you have no share with me . ”
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , wash not only my feet , but also my hands and my head ! ”
43013010	Jesus replied , “ The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet , but is completely clean . And you disciples are clean , but not every one of you . ”
43013011	( For Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him . For this reason he said , “ Not every one of you is clean . ” )
43013012	So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on , he took his place at the table again and said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done for you ?
43013013	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and do so correctly , for that is what I am .
43013014	If I then , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you too ought to wash one another’s feet .
43013015	For I have given you an example – you should do just as I have done for you .
43013016	I tell you the solemn truth , the slave is not greater than his master , nor is the one who is sent as a messenger greater than the one who sent him .
43013017	If you understand these things , you will be blessed if you do them .
43013018	“ What I am saying does not refer to all of you . I know the ones I have chosen . But this is to fulfill the scripture , ‘ The one who eats my bread has turned against me . ’
43013019	I am telling you this now , before it happens , so that when it happens you may believe that I am he .
43013020	I tell you the solemn truth , whoever accepts the one I send accepts me , and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me . ”
43013021	When he had said these things , Jesus was greatly distressed in spirit , and testified , “ I tell you the solemn truth , one of you will betray me . ”
43013022	The disciples began to look at one another , worried and perplexed to know which of them he was talking about .
43013023	One of his disciples , the one Jesus loved , was at the table to the right of Jesus in a place of honor .
43013024	So Simon Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to .
43013025	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
43013026	Jesus replied , “ It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish . ” Then he dipped the piece of bread in the dish and gave it to Judas Iscariot , Simon’s son .
43013027	And after Judas took the piece of bread , Satan entered into him . Jesus said to him , “ What you are about to do , do quickly . ”
43013028	( Now none of those present at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas .
43013029	Some thought that , because Judas had the money box , Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast , or to give something to the poor . )
43013030	Judas took the piece of bread and went out immediately . ( Now it was night . )
43013031	When Judas had gone out , Jesus said , “ Now the Son of Man is glorified , and God is glorified in him .
43013032	If God is glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and he will glorify him right away .
43013033	Children , I am still with you for a little while . You will look for me , and just as I said to the Jewish religious leaders , ‘ Where I am going you cannot come , ’ now I tell you the same .
43013034	“ I give you a new commandment – to love one another . Just as I have loved you , you also are to love one another .
43013035	Everyone will know by this that you are my disciples – if you have love for one another . ”
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus replied , “ Where I am going , you cannot follow me now , but you will follow later . ”
43013037	Peter said to him , “ Lord , why can’t I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you ! ”
43013038	Jesus answered , “ Will you lay down your life for me ? I tell you the solemn truth , the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times !
43014001	“ Do not let your hearts be distressed . You believe in God ; believe also in me .
43014002	There are many dwelling places in my Father’s house . Otherwise , I would have told you , because I am going away to make ready a place for you .
43014003	And if I go and make ready a place for you , I will come again and take you to be with me , so that where I am you may be too .
43014004	And you know the way where I am going . ”
43014005	Thomas said , “ Lord , we don’t know where you are going . How can we know the way ? ”
43014006	Jesus replied , “ I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
43014007	If you have known me , you will know my Father too . And from now on you do know him and have seen him . ”
43014008	Philip said , “ Lord , show us the Father , and we will be content . ”
43014009	Jesus replied , “ Have I been with you for so long , and you have not known me , Philip ? The person who has seen me has seen the Father ! How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014010	Do you not believe that I am in the Father , and the Father is in me ? The words that I say to you , I do not speak on my own initiative , but the Father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds .
43014011	Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father is in me , but if you do not believe me , believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves .
43014012	I tell you the solemn truth , the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing , and will perform greater deeds than these , because I am going to the Father .
43014013	And I will do whatever you ask in my name , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	If you ask me anything in my name , I will do it .
43014015	“ If you love me , you will obey my commandments .
43014016	Then I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever –
43014017	the Spirit of truth , whom the world cannot accept , because it does not see him or know him . But you know him , because he resides with you and will be in you .
43014018	“ I will not abandon you as orphans , I will come to you .
43014019	In a little while the world will not see me any longer , but you will see me ; because I live , you will live too .
43014020	You will know at that time that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you .
43014021	The person who has my commandments and obeys them is the one who loves me . The one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will reveal myself to him . ”
43014022	“ Lord , ” Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) said , “ what has happened that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
43014023	Jesus replied , “ If anyone loves me , he will obey my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and take up residence with him .
43014024	The person who does not love me does not obey my words . And the word you hear is not mine , but the Father’s who sent me .
43014025	“ I have spoken these things while staying with you .
43014026	But the Advocate , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you everything , and will cause you to remember everything I said to you .
43014027	“ Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give to you ; I do not give it to you as the world does . Do not let your hearts be distressed or lacking in courage .
43014028	You heard me say to you , ‘ I am going away and I am coming back to you . ’ If you loved me , you would be glad that I am going to the Father , because the Father is greater than I am .
43014029	I have told you now before it happens , so that when it happens you may believe .
43014030	I will not speak with you much longer , for the ruler of this world is coming . He has no power over me ,
43014031	but I am doing just what the Father commanded me , so that the world may know that I love the Father . Get up , let us go from here . ”
43015001	“ I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener .
43015002	He takes away every branch that does not bear fruit in me . He prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit .
43015003	You are clean already because of the word that I have spoken to you .
43015004	Remain in me , and I will remain in you . Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you unless you remain in me .
43015005	“ I am the vine ; you are the branches . The one who remains in me – and I in him – bears much fruit , because apart from me you can accomplish nothing .
43015006	If anyone does not remain in me , he is thrown out like a branch , and dries up ; and such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire , and are burned up .
43015007	If you remain in me and my words remain in you , ask whatever you want , and it will be done for you .
43015008	My Father is honored by this , that you bear much fruit and show that you are my disciples .
43015009	“ Just as the Father has loved me , I have also loved you ; remain in my love .
43015010	If you obey my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I have obeyed my Father’s commandments and remain in his love .
43015011	I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you , and your joy may be complete .
43015012	My commandment is this – to love one another just as I have loved you .
43015013	No one has greater love than this – that one lays down his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
43015015	I no longer call you slaves , because the slave does not understand what his master is doing . But I have called you friends , because I have revealed to you everything I heard from my Father .
43015016	You did not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit , fruit that remains , so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you .
43015017	This I command you – to love one another .
43015018	“ If the world hates you , be aware that it hated me first .
43015019	If you belonged to the world , the world would love you as its own . However , because you do not belong to the world , but I chose you out of the world , for this reason the world hates you .
43015020	Remember what I told you , ‘ A slave is not greater than his master . ’ If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . If they obeyed my word , they will obey yours too .
43015021	But they will do all these things to you on account of my name , because they do not know the one who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin . But they no longer have any excuse for their sin .
43015023	The one who hates me hates my Father too .
43015024	If I had not performed among them the miraculous deeds that no one else did , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have seen the deeds and have hated both me and my Father .
43015025	Now this happened to fulfill the word that is written in their law , ‘ They hated me without reason . ’
43015026	When the Advocate comes , whom I will send you from the Father – the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father – he will testify about me ,
43015027	and you also will testify , because you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	“ I have told you all these things so that you will not fall away .
43016002	They will put you out of the synagogue , yet a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he is offering service to God .
43016003	They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me .
43016004	But I have told you these things so that when their time comes , you will remember that I told you about them . “ I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you .
43016005	But now I am going to the one who sent me , and not one of you is asking me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016006	Instead your hearts are filled with sadness because I have said these things to you .
43016007	But I tell you the truth , it is to your advantage that I am going away . For if I do not go away , the Advocate will not come to you , but if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	And when he comes , he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment –
43016009	concerning sin , because they do not believe in me ;
43016010	concerning righteousness , because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer ;
43016011	and concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world has been condemned .
43016012	“ I have many more things to say to you , but you cannot bear them now .
43016013	But when he , the Spirit of truth , comes , he will guide you into all truth . For he will not speak on his own authority , but will speak whatever he hears , and will tell you what is to come .
43016014	He will glorify me , because he will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you .
43016015	Everything that the Father has is mine ; that is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you .
43016016	In a little while you will see me no longer ; again after a little while , you will see me . ”
43016017	Then some of his disciples said to one another , “ What is the meaning of what he is saying , ‘ In a little while you will not see me ; again after a little while , you will see me , ’ and , ‘ because I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
43016018	So they kept on repeating , “ What is the meaning of what he says , ‘ In a little while ’ ? We do not understand what he is talking about . ”
43016019	Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things , so he said to them , “ Are you asking each other about this – that I said , ‘ In a little while you will not see me ; again after a little while , you will see me ’ ?
43016020	I tell you the solemn truth , you will weep and wail , but the world will rejoice ; you will be sad , but your sadness will turn into joy .
43016021	When a woman gives birth , she has distress because her time has come , but when her child is born , she no longer remembers the suffering because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world .
43016022	So also you have sorrow now , but I will see you again , and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you .
43016023	At that time you will ask me nothing . I tell you the solemn truth , whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you .
43016024	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask and you will receive it , so that your joy may be complete .
43016025	“ I have told you these things in obscure figures of speech ; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures , but will tell you plainly about the Father .
43016026	At that time you will ask in my name , and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
43016027	For the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God .
43016028	I came from the Father and entered into the world , but in turn , I am leaving the world and going back to the Father . ”
43016029	His disciples said , “ Look , now you are speaking plainly and not in obscure figures of speech !
43016030	Now we know that you know everything and do not need anyone to ask you anything . Because of this we believe that you have come from God . ”
43016031	Jesus replied , “ Do you now believe ?
43016032	Look , a time is coming – and has come – when you will be scattered , each one to his own home , and I will be left alone . Yet I am not alone , because my Father is with me .
43016033	I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace . In the world you have trouble and suffering , but take courage – I have conquered the world . ”
43017001	When Jesus had finished saying these things , he looked upward to heaven and said , “ Father , the time has come . Glorify your Son , so that your Son may glorify you –
43017002	just as you have given him authority over all humanity , so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him .
43017003	Now this is eternal life – that they know you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom you sent .
43017004	I glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do .
43017005	And now , Father , glorify me at your side with the glory I had with you before the world was created .
43017006	“ I have revealed your name to the men you gave me out of the world . They belonged to you , and you gave them to me , and they have obeyed your word .
43017007	Now they understand that everything you have given me comes from you ,
43017008	because I have given them the words you have given me . They accepted them and really understand that I came from you , and they believed that you sent me .
43017009	I am praying on behalf of them . I am not praying on behalf of the world , but on behalf of those you have given me , because they belong to you .
43017010	Everything I have belongs to you , and everything you have belongs to me , and I have been glorified by them .
43017011	I am no longer in the world , but they are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them safe in your name that you have given me , so that they may be one just as we are one .
43017012	When I was with them I kept them safe and watched over them in your name that you have given me . Not one of them was lost except the one destined for destruction , so that the scripture could be fulfilled .
43017013	But now I am coming to you , and I am saying these things in the world , so they may experience my joy completed in themselves .
43017014	I have given them your word , and the world has hated them , because they do not belong to the world , just as I do not belong to the world .
43017015	I am not asking you to take them out of the world , but that you keep them safe from the evil one .
43017016	They do not belong to the world just as I do not belong to the world .
43017017	Set them apart in the truth ; your word is truth .
43017018	Just as you sent me into the world , so I sent them into the world .
43017019	And I set myself apart on their behalf , so that they too may be truly set apart .
43017020	“ I am not praying only on their behalf , but also on behalf of those who believe in me through their testimony ,
43017021	that they will all be one , just as you , Father , are in me and I am in you . I pray that they will be in us , so that the world will believe that you sent me .
43017022	The glory you gave to me I have given to them , that they may be one just as we are one –
43017023	I in them and you in me – that they may be completely one , so that the world will know that you sent me , and you have loved them just as you have loved me .
43017024	“ Father , I want those you have given me to be with me where I am , so that they can see my glory that you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world .
43017025	Righteous Father , even if the world does not know you , I know you , and these men know that you sent me .
43017026	I made known your name to them , and I will continue to make it known , so that the love you have loved me with may be in them , and I may be in them . ”
43018001	When he had said these things , Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley . There was an orchard there , and he and his disciples went into it .
43018002	( Now Judas , the one who betrayed him , knew the place too , because Jesus had met there many times with his disciples . )
43018003	So Judas obtained a squad of soldiers and some officers of the chief priests and Pharisees . They came to the orchard with lanterns and torches and weapons .
43018004	Then Jesus , because he knew everything that was going to happen to him , came and asked them , “ Who are you looking for ? ”
43018005	They replied , “ Jesus the Nazarene . ” He told them , “ I am he . ” ( Now Judas , the one who betrayed him , was standing there with them . )
43018006	So when Jesus said to them , “ I am he , ” they retreated and fell to the ground .
43018007	Then Jesus asked them again , “ Who are you looking for ? ” And they said , “ Jesus the Nazarene . ”
43018008	Jesus replied , “ I told you that I am he . If you are looking for me , let these men go . ”
43018009	He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken , “ I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me . ”
43018010	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , pulled it out and struck the high priest’s slave , cutting off his right ear . ( Now the slave’s name was Malchus . )
43018011	But Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword back into its sheath ! Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me ? ”
43018012	Then the squad of soldiers with their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up .
43018013	They brought him first to Annas , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
43018014	( Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was to their advantage that one man die for the people . )
43018015	Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas . ( Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest , and he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard . )
43018016	But Simon Peter was left standing outside by the door . So the other disciple who was acquainted with the high priest came out and spoke to the slave girl who watched the door , and brought Peter inside .
43018017	The girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter , “ You’re not one of this man’s disciples too , are you ? ” He replied , “ I am not . ”
43018018	( Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire they had made , warming themselves because it was cold . Peter also was standing with them , warming himself . )
43018019	While this was happening , the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching .
43018020	Jesus replied , “ I have spoken publicly to the world . I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple courts , where all the Jewish people assemble together . I have said nothing in secret .
43018021	Why do you ask me ? Ask those who heard what I said . They know what I said . ”
43018022	When Jesus had said this , one of the high priest’s officers who stood nearby struck him on the face and said , “ Is that the way you answer the high priest ? ”
43018023	Jesus replied , “ If I have said something wrong , confirm what is wrong . But if I spoke correctly , why strike me ? ”
43018024	Then Annas sent him , still tied up , to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing in the courtyard warming himself . They said to him , “ You aren’t one of his disciples too , are you ? ” Peter denied it : “ I am not ! ”
43018026	One of the high priest’s slaves , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , said , “ Did I not see you in the orchard with him ? ”
43018027	Then Peter denied it again , and immediately a rooster crowed .
43018028	Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s residence . ( Now it was very early morning . ) They did not go into the governor’s residence so they would not be ceremonially defiled , but could eat the Passover meal .
43018029	So Pilate came outside to them and said , “ What accusation do you bring against this man ? ”
43018030	They replied , “ If this man were not a criminal , we would not have handed him over to you . ”
43018031	Pilate told them , “ Take him yourselves and pass judgment on him according to your own law ! ” The Jewish leaders replied , “ We cannot legally put anyone to death . ”
43018032	( This happened to fulfill the word Jesus had spoken when he indicated what kind of death he was going to die . )
43018033	So Pilate went back into the governor’s residence , summoned Jesus , and asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
43018034	Jesus replied , “ Are you saying this on your own initiative , or have others told you about me ? ”
43018035	Pilate answered , “ I am not a Jew , am I ? Your own people and your chief priests handed you over to me . What have you done ? ”
43018036	Jesus replied , “ My kingdom is not from this world . If my kingdom were from this world , my servants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish authorities . But as it is , my kingdom is not from here . ”
43018037	Then Pilate said , “ So you are a king ! ” Jesus replied , “ You say that I am a king . For this reason I was born , and for this reason I came into the world – to testify to the truth . Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice . ”
43018038	Pilate asked , “ What is truth ? ” When he had said this he went back outside to the Jewish leaders and announced , “ I find no basis for an accusation against him .
43018039	But it is your custom that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover . So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews ? ”
43018040	Then they shouted back , “ Not this man , but Barabbas ! ” ( Now Barabbas was a revolutionary . )
43019001	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged severely .
43019002	The soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and they clothed him in a purple robe .
43019003	They came up to him again and again and said , “ Hail , king of the Jews ! ” And they struck him repeatedly in the face .
43019004	Again Pilate went out and said to the Jewish leaders , “ Look , I am bringing him out to you , so that you may know that I find no reason for an accusation against him . ”
43019005	So Jesus came outside , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ Look , here is the man ! ”
43019006	When the chief priests and their officers saw him , they shouted out , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said , “ You take him and crucify him ! Certainly I find no reason for an accusation against him ! ”
43019007	The Jewish leaders replied , “ We have a law , and according to our law he ought to die , because he claimed to be the Son of God ! ”
43019008	When Pilate heard what they said , he was more afraid than ever ,
43019009	and he went back into the governor’s residence and said to Jesus , “ Where do you come from ? ” But Jesus gave him no answer .
43019010	So Pilate said , “ Do you refuse to speak to me ? Don’t you know I have the authority to release you , and to crucify you ? ”
43019011	Jesus replied , “ You would have no authority over me at all , unless it was given to you from above . Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of greater sin . ”
43019012	From this point on , Pilate tried to release him . But the Jewish leaders shouted out , “ If you release this man , you are no friend of Caesar ! Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar ! ”
43019013	When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in the place called “ The Stone Pavement ” ( Gabbatha in Aramaic ) .
43019014	( Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover , about noon . ) Pilate said to the Jewish leaders , “ Look , here is your king ! ”
43019015	Then they shouted out , “ Away with him ! Away with him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate asked , “ Shall I crucify your king ? ” The high priests replied , “ We have no king except Caesar ! ”
43019016	Then Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified . So they took Jesus ,
43019017	and carrying his own cross he went out to the place called “ The Place of the Skull ” ( called in Aramaic Golgotha ) .
43019018	There they crucified him along with two others , one on each side , with Jesus in the middle .
43019019	Pilate also had a notice written and fastened to the cross , which read : “ Jesus the Nazarene , the king of the Jews . ”
43019020	Thus many of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and the notice was written in Aramaic , Latin , and Greek .
43019021	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ The king of the Jews , ’ but rather , ‘ This man said , I am king of the Jews . ’ ”
43019022	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written . ”
43019023	Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and made four shares , one for each soldier , and the tunic remained . ( Now the tunic was seamless , woven from top to bottom as a single piece . )
43019024	So the soldiers said to one another , “ Let’s not tear it , but throw dice to see who will get it . ” This took place to fulfill the scripture that says , “ They divided my garments among them , and for my clothing they threw dice . ” So the soldiers did these things .
43019025	Now standing beside Jesus’ cross were his mother , his mother’s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , “ Woman , look , here is your son ! ”
43019027	He then said to his disciple , “ Look , here is your mother ! ” From that very time the disciple took her into his own home .
43019028	After this Jesus , realizing that by this time everything was completed , said ( in order to fulfill the scripture ) , “ I am thirsty ! ”
43019029	A jar full of sour wine was there , so they put a sponge soaked in sour wine on a branch of hyssop and lifted it to his mouth .
43019030	When he had received the sour wine , Jesus said , “ It is completed ! ” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
43019031	Then , because it was the day of preparation , so that the bodies should not stay on the crosses on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was an especially important one ) , the Jewish leaders asked Pilate to have the victims’ legs broken and the bodies taken down .
43019032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who had been crucified with Jesus , first the one and then the other .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and blood and water flowed out immediately .
43019035	And the person who saw it has testified ( and his testimony is true , and he knows that he is telling the truth ) , so that you also may believe .
43019036	For these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled , “ Not a bone of his will be broken . ”
43019037	And again another scripture says , “ They will look on the one whom they have pierced . ”
43019038	After this , Joseph of Arimathea , a disciple of Jesus ( but secretly , because he feared the Jewish leaders ) , asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus . Pilate gave him permission , so he went and took the body away .
43019039	Nicodemus , the man who had previously come to Jesus at night , accompanied Joseph , carrying a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about seventy-five pounds .
43019040	Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it , with the aromatic spices , in strips of linen cloth according to Jewish burial customs .
43019041	Now at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden , and in the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried .
43019042	And so , because it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby , they placed Jesus’ body there .
43020001	Now very early on the first day of the week , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved away from the entrance .
43020002	So she went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told them , “ They have taken the Lord from the tomb , and we don’t know where they have put him ! ”
43020003	Then Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb .
43020004	The two were running together , but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first .
43020005	He bent down and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .
43020006	Then Simon Peter , who had been following him , arrived and went right into the tomb . He saw the strips of linen cloth lying there ,
43020007	and the face cloth , which had been around Jesus’ head , not lying with the strips of linen cloth but rolled up in a place by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , came in , and he saw and believed .
43020009	( For they did not yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead . )
43020010	So the disciples went back to their homes .
43020011	But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping . As she wept , she bent down and looked into the tomb .
43020012	And she saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been lying , one at the head and one at the feet .
43020013	They said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” Mary replied , “ They have taken my Lord away , and I do not know where they have put him ! ”
43020014	When she had said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not know that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Who are you looking for ? ” Because she thought he was the gardener , she said to him , “ Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have put him , and I will take him . ”
43020016	Jesus said to her , “ Mary . ” She turned and said to him in Aramaic , “ Rabboni ” ( which means Teacher ) .
43020017	Jesus replied , “ Do not touch me , for I have not yet ascended to my Father . Go to my brothers and tell them , ‘ I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ’ ”
43020018	Mary Magdalene came and informed the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord ! ” And she told them what Jesus had said to her .
43020019	On the evening of that day , the first day of the week , the disciples had gathered together and locked the doors of the place because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders . Jesus came and stood among them and said to them , “ Peace be with you . ”
43020020	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord .
43020021	So Jesus said to them again , “ Peace be with you . Just as the Father has sent me , I also send you . ”
43020022	And after he said this , he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive anyone’s sins , they are forgiven ; if you retain anyone’s sins , they are retained . ”
43020024	Now Thomas ( called Didymus ) , one of the twelve , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	The other disciples told him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he replied , “ Unless I see the wounds from the nails in his hands , and put my finger into the wounds from the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will never believe it ! ”
43020026	Eight days later the disciples were again together in the house , and Thomas was with them . Although the doors were locked , Jesus came and stood among them and said , “ Peace be with you ! ”
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and examine my hands . Extend your hand and put it into my side . Do not continue in your unbelief , but believe . ”
43020028	Thomas replied to him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
43020029	Jesus said to him , “ Have you believed because you have seen me ? Blessed are the people who have not seen and yet have believed . ”
43020030	Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of the disciples , which are not recorded in this book .
43020031	But these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that by believing you may have life in his name .
43021001	After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias . Now this is how he did so .
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas ( called Didymus ) , Nathanael ( who was from Cana in Galilee ) , the sons of Zebedee , and two other disciples of his were together .
43021003	Simon Peter told them , “ I am going fishing . ” “ We will go with you , ” they replied . They went out and got into the boat , but that night they caught nothing .
43021004	When it was already very early morning , Jesus stood on the beach , but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
43021005	So Jesus said to them , “ Children , you don’t have any fish , do you ? ” They replied , “ No . ”
43021006	He told them , “ Throw your net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some . ” So they threw the net , and were not able to pull it in because of the large number of fish .
43021007	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” So Simon Peter , when he heard that it was the Lord , tucked in his outer garment ( for he had nothing on underneath it ) , and plunged into the sea .
43021008	Meanwhile the other disciples came with the boat , dragging the net full of fish , for they were not far from land , only about a hundred yards .
43021009	When they got out on the beach , they saw a charcoal fire ready with a fish placed on it , and bread .
43021010	Jesus said , “ Bring some of the fish you have just now caught . ”
43021011	So Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net to shore . It was full of large fish , one hundred fifty-three , but although there were so many , the net was not torn .
43021012	“ Come , have breakfast , ” Jesus said . But none of the disciples dared to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , and did the same with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead .
43021015	Then when they had finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these do ? ” He replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know I love you . ” Jesus told him , “ Feed my lambs . ”
43021016	Jesus said a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” He replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know I love you . ” Jesus told him , “ Shepherd my sheep . ”
43021017	Jesus said a third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time , “ Do you love me ? ” and said , “ Lord , you know everything . You know that I love you . ” Jesus replied , “ Feed my sheep .
43021018	I tell you the solemn truth , when you were young , you tied your clothes around you and went wherever you wanted , but when you are old , you will stretch out your hands , and others will tie you up and bring you where you do not want to go . ”
43021019	( Now Jesus said this to indicate clearly by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God . ) After he said this , Jesus told Peter , “ Follow me . ”
43021020	Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them . ( This was the disciple who had leaned back against Jesus’ chest at the meal and asked , “ Lord , who is the one who is going to betray you ? ” )
43021021	So when Peter saw him , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
43021022	Jesus replied , “ If I want him to live until I come back , what concern is that of yours ? You follow me ! ”
43021023	So the saying circulated among the brothers and sisters that this disciple was not going to die . But Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die , but rather , “ If I want him to live until I come back , what concern is that of yours ? ”
43021024	This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things , and we know that his testimony is true .
43021025	There are many other things that Jesus did . If every one of them were written down , I suppose the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written .
44001001	I wrote the former account , Theophilus , about all that Jesus began to do and teach
44001002	until the day he was taken up to heaven , after he had given orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen .
44001003	To the same apostles also , after his suffering , he presented himself alive with many convincing proofs . He was seen by them over a forty-day period and spoke about matters concerning the kingdom of God .
44001004	While he was with them , he declared , “ Do not leave Jerusalem , but wait there for what my Father promised , which you heard about from me .
44001005	For John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now . ”
44001006	So when they had gathered together , they began to ask him , “ Lord , is this the time when you are restoring the kingdom to Israel ? ”
44001007	He told them , “ You are not permitted to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority .
44001008	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you , and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and to the farthest parts of the earth . ”
44001009	After he had said this , while they were watching , he was lifted up and a cloud hid him from their sight .
44001010	As they were still staring into the sky while he was going , suddenly two men in white clothing stood near them
44001011	and said , “ Men of Galilee , why do you stand here looking up into the sky ? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will come back in the same way you saw him go into heaven . ”
44001012	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Mount of Olives ( which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day’s journey away ) .
44001013	When they had entered Jerusalem , they went to the upstairs room where they were staying . Peter and John , and James , and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot , and Judas son of James were there .
44001014	All these continued together in prayer with one mind , together with the women , along with Mary the mother of Jesus , and his brothers .
44001015	In those days Peter stood up among the believers ( a gathering of about one hundred and twenty people ) and said ,
44001016	“ Brothers , the scripture had to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit foretold through David concerning Judas – who became the guide for those who arrested Jesus –
44001017	for he was counted as one of us and received a share in this ministry . ”
44001018	( Now this man Judas acquired a field with the reward of his unjust deed , and falling headfirst he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out .
44001019	This became known to all who lived in Jerusalem , so that in their own language they called that field Hakeldama , that is , “ Field of Blood . ” )
44001020	“ For it is written in the book of Psalms , ‘ Let his house become deserted , and let there be no one to live in it , ’ and ‘ Let another take his position of responsibility . ’
44001021	Thus one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time the Lord Jesus associated with us ,
44001022	beginning from his baptism by John until the day he was taken up from us – one of these must become a witness of his resurrection together with us . ”
44001023	So they proposed two candidates : Joseph called Barsabbas ( also called Justus ) and Matthias .
44001024	Then they prayed , “ Lord , you know the hearts of all . Show us which one of these two you have chosen
44001025	to assume the task of this service and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place . ”
44001026	Then they cast lots for them , and the one chosen was Matthias ; so he was counted with the eleven apostles .
44002001	Now when the day of Pentecost had come , they were all together in one place .
44002002	Suddenly a sound like a violent wind blowing came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting .
44002003	And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them .
44002004	All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit , and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them .
44002005	Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem .
44002006	When this sound occurred , a crowd gathered and was in confusion , because each one heard them speaking in his own language .
44002007	Completely baffled , they said , “ Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans ?
44002008	And how is it that each one of us hears them in our own native language ?
44002009	Parthians , Medes , Elamites , and residents of Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and the province of Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene , and visitors from Rome ,
44002011	both Jews and proselytes , Cretans and Arabs – we hear them speaking in our own languages about the great deeds God has done ! ”
44002012	All were astounded and greatly confused , saying to one another , “ What does this mean ? ”
44002013	But others jeered at the speakers , saying , “ They are drunk on new wine ! ”
44002014	But Peter stood up with the eleven , raised his voice , and addressed them : “ You men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem , know this and listen carefully to what I say .
44002015	In spite of what you think , these men are not drunk , for it is only nine o’clock in the morning .
44002016	But this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel :
44002017	‘ And in the last days it will be , ’ God says , ‘ that I will pour out my Spirit on all people , and your sons and your daughters will prophesy , and your young men will see visions , and your old men will dream dreams .
44002018	Even on my servants , both men and women , I will pour out my Spirit in those days , and they will prophesy .
44002019	And I will perform wonders in the sky above and miraculous signs on the earth below , blood and fire and clouds of smoke .
44002020	The sun will be changed to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes .
44002021	And then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . ’
44002022	“ Men of Israel , listen to these words : Jesus the Nazarene , a man clearly attested to you by God with powerful deeds , wonders , and miraculous signs that God performed among you through him , just as you yourselves know –
44002023	this man , who was handed over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God , you executed by nailing him to a cross at the hands of Gentiles .
44002024	But God raised him up , having released him from the pains of death , because it was not possible for him to be held in its power .
44002025	For David says about him , ‘ I saw the Lord always in front of me , for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken .
44002026	Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced ; my body also will live in hope ,
44002027	because you will not leave my soul in Hades , nor permit your Holy One to experience decay .
44002028	You have made known to me the paths of life ; you will make me full of joy with your presence . ’
44002029	“ Brothers , I can speak confidently to you about our forefather David , that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
44002030	So then , because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne ,
44002031	David by foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ , that he was neither abandoned to Hades , nor did his body experience decay .
44002032	This Jesus God raised up , and we are all witnesses of it .
44002033	So then , exalted to the right hand of God , and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father , he has poured out what you both see and hear .
44002034	For David did not ascend into heaven , but he himself says , ‘ The Lord said to my lord , “ Sit at my right hand
44002035	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . ” ’
44002036	Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt that God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ . ”
44002037	Now when they heard this , they were acutely distressed and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles , “ What should we do , brothers ? ”
44002038	Peter said to them , “ Repent , and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For the promise is for you and your children , and for all who are far away , as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . ”
44002040	With many other words he testified and exhorted them saying , “ Save yourselves from this perverse generation ! ”
44002041	So those who accepted his message were baptized , and that day about three thousand people were added .
44002042	They were devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship , to the breaking of bread and to prayer .
44002043	Reverential awe came over everyone , and many wonders and miraculous signs came about by the apostles .
44002044	All who believed were together and held everything in common ,
44002045	and they began selling their property and possessions and distributing the proceeds to everyone , as anyone had need .
44002046	Every day they continued to gather together by common consent in the temple courts , breaking bread from house to house , sharing their food with glad and humble hearts ,
44002047	praising God and having the good will of all the people . And the Lord was adding to their number every day those who were being saved .
44003001	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time for prayer , at three o’clock in the afternoon .
44003002	And a man lame from birth was being carried up , who was placed at the temple gate called “ the Beautiful Gate ” every day so he could beg for money from those going into the temple courts .
44003003	When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts , he asked them for money .
44003004	Peter looked directly at him ( as did John ) and said , “ Look at us ! ”
44003005	So the lame man paid attention to them , expecting to receive something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , “ I have no silver or gold , but what I do have I give you . In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene , stand up and walk ! ”
44003007	Then Peter took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up , and at once the man’s feet and ankles were made strong .
44003008	He jumped up , stood and began walking around , and he entered the temple courts with them , walking and leaping and praising God .
44003009	All the people saw him walking and praising God ,
44003010	and they recognized him as the man who used to sit and ask for donations at the Beautiful Gate of the temple , and they were filled with astonishment and amazement at what had happened to him .
44003011	While the man was hanging on to Peter and John , all the people , completely astounded , ran together to them in the covered walkway called Solomon’s Portico .
44003012	When Peter saw this , he declared to the people , “ Men of Israel , why are you amazed at this ? Why do you stare at us as if we had made this man walk by our own power or piety ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , the God of our forefathers , has glorified his servant Jesus , whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate after he had decided to release him .
44003014	But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a man who was a murderer be released to you .
44003015	You killed the Originator of life , whom God raised from the dead . To this fact we are witnesses !
44003016	And on the basis of faith in Jesus’ name , his very name has made this man – whom you see and know – strong . The faith that is through Jesus has given him this complete health in the presence of you all .
44003017	And now , brothers , I know you acted in ignorance , as your rulers did too .
44003018	But the things God foretold long ago through all the prophets – that his Christ would suffer – he has fulfilled in this way .
44003019	Therefore repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out ,
44003020	so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord , and so that he may send the Messiah appointed for you – that is , Jesus .
44003021	This one heaven must receive until the time all things are restored , which God declared from times long ago through his holy prophets .
44003022	Moses said , ‘ The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers . You must obey him in everything he tells you .
44003023	Every person who does not obey that prophet will be destroyed and thus removed from the people . ’
44003024	And all the prophets , from Samuel and those who followed him , have spoken about and announced these days .
44003025	You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors , saying to Abraham , ‘ And in your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed . ’
44003026	God raised up his servant and sent him first to you , to bless you by turning each one of you from your iniquities . ”
44004001	While Peter and John were speaking to the people , the priests and the commander of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them ,
44004002	angry because they were teaching the people and announcing in Jesus the resurrection of the dead .
44004003	So they seized them and put them in jail until the next day ( for it was already evening ) .
44004004	But many of those who had listened to the message believed , and the number of the men came to about five thousand .
44004005	On the next day , their rulers , elders , and experts in the law came together in Jerusalem .
44004006	Annas the high priest was there , and Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and others who were members of the high priest’s family .
44004007	After making Peter and John stand in their midst , they began to inquire , “ By what power or by what name did you do this ? ”
44004008	Then Peter , filled with the Holy Spirit , replied , “ Rulers of the people and elders ,
44004009	if we are being examined today for a good deed done to a sick man – by what means this man was healed –
44004010	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene whom you crucified , whom God raised from the dead , this man stands before you healthy .
44004011	This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you , the builders , that has become the cornerstone .
44004012	And there is salvation in no one else , for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved . ”
44004013	When they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and discovered that they were uneducated and ordinary men , they were amazed and recognized these men had been with Jesus .
44004014	And because they saw the man who had been healed standing with them , they had nothing to say against this .
44004015	But when they had ordered them to go outside the council , they began to confer with one another ,
44004016	saying , “ What should we do with these men ? For it is plain to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable miraculous sign has come about through them , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But to keep this matter from spreading any further among the people , let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name . ”
44004018	And they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John replied , “ Whether it is right before God to obey you rather than God , you decide ,
44004020	for it is impossible for us not to speak about what we have seen and heard . ”
44004021	After threatening them further , they released them , for they could not find how to punish them on account of the people , because they were all praising God for what had happened .
44004022	For the man , on whom this miraculous sign of healing had been performed , was over forty years old .
44004023	When they were released , Peter and John went to their fellow believers and reported everything the high priests and the elders had said to them .
44004024	When they heard this , they raised their voices to God with one mind and said , “ Master of all , you who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and everything that is in them ,
44004025	who said by the Holy Spirit through your servant David our forefather , ‘ Why do the nations rage , and the peoples plot foolish things ?
44004026	The kings of the earth stood together , and the rulers assembled together , against the Lord and against his Christ . ’
44004027	“ For indeed both Herod and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus , whom you anointed ,
44004028	to do as much as your power and your plan had decided beforehand would happen .
44004029	And now , Lord , pay attention to their threats , and grant to your servants to speak your message with great courage ,
44004030	while you extend your hand to heal , and to bring about miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus . ”
44004031	When they had prayed , the place where they were assembled together was shaken , and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God courageously .
44004032	The group of those who believed were of one heart and mind , and no one said that any of his possessions was his own , but everything was held in common .
44004033	With great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and great grace was on them all .
44004034	For there was no one needy among them , because those who were owners of land or houses were selling them and bringing the proceeds from the sales
44004035	and placing them at the apostles’ feet . The proceeds were distributed to each , as anyone had need .
44004036	So Joseph , a Levite who was a native of Cyprus , called by the apostles Barnabas ( which is translated “ son of encouragement ” ) ,
44004037	sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and placed it at the apostles’ feet .
44005001	Now a man named Ananias , together with Sapphira his wife , sold a piece of property .
44005002	He kept back for himself part of the proceeds with his wife’s knowledge ; he brought only part of it and placed it at the apostles’ feet .
44005003	But Peter said , “ Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back for yourself part of the proceeds from the sale of the land ?
44005004	Before it was sold , did it not belong to you ? And when it was sold , was the money not at your disposal ? How have you thought up this deed in your heart ? You have not lied to people but to God ! ”
44005005	When Ananias heard these words he collapsed and died , and great fear gripped all who heard about it .
44005006	So the young men came , wrapped him up , carried him out , and buried him .
44005007	After an interval of about three hours , his wife came in , but she did not know what had happened .
44005008	Peter said to her , “ Tell me , were the two of you paid this amount for the land ? ” Sapphira said , “ Yes , that much . ”
44005009	Peter then told her , “ Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord ? Look ! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out ! ”
44005010	At once she collapsed at his feet and died . So when the young men came in , they found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	Great fear gripped the whole church and all who heard about these things .
44005012	Now many miraculous signs and wonders came about among the people through the hands of the apostles . By common consent they were all meeting together in Solomon’s Portico .
44005013	None of the rest dared to join them , but the people held them in high honor .
44005014	More and more believers in the Lord were added to their number , crowds of both men and women .
44005015	Thus they even carried the sick out into the streets , and put them on cots and pallets , so that when Peter came by at least his shadow would fall on some of them .
44005016	A crowd of people from the towns around Jerusalem also came together , bringing the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits . They were all being healed .
44005017	Now the high priest rose up , and all those with him ( that is , the religious party of the Sadducees ) , and they were filled with jealousy .
44005018	They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail .
44005019	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison , led them out , and said ,
44005020	“ Go and stand in the temple courts and proclaim to the people all the words of this life . ”
44005021	When they heard this , they entered the temple courts at daybreak and began teaching . Now when the high priest and those who were with him arrived , they summoned the Sanhedrin – that is , the whole high council of the Israelites – and sent to the jail to have the apostles brought before them .
44005022	But the officers who came for them did not find them in the prison , so they returned and reported ,
44005023	“ We found the jail locked securely and the guards standing at the doors , but when we opened them , we found no one inside . ”
44005024	Now when the commander of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this report , they were greatly puzzled concerning it , wondering what this could be .
44005025	But someone came and reported to them , “ Look ! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple courts and teaching the people ! ”
44005026	Then the commander of the temple guard went with the officers and brought the apostles without the use of force ( for they were afraid of being stoned by the people ) .
44005027	When they had brought them , they stood them before the council , and the high priest questioned them ,
44005028	saying , “ We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name . Look , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and you intend to bring this man’s blood on us ! ”
44005029	But Peter and the apostles replied , “ We must obey God rather than people .
44005030	The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus , whom you seized and killed by hanging him on a tree .
44005031	God exalted him to his right hand as Leader and Savior , to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins .
44005032	And we are witnesses of these events , and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him . ”
44005033	Now when they heard this , they became furious and wanted to execute them .
44005034	But a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliel , a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people , stood up in the council and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time .
44005035	Then he said to the council , “ Men of Israel , pay close attention to what you are about to do to these men .
44005036	For some time ago Theudas rose up , claiming to be somebody , and about four hundred men joined him . He was killed , and all who followed him were dispersed and nothing came of it .
44005037	After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census , and incited people to follow him in revolt . He too was killed , and all who followed him were scattered .
44005038	So in this case I say to you , stay away from these men and leave them alone , because if this plan or this undertaking originates with people , it will come to nothing ,
44005039	but if it is from God , you will not be able to stop them , or you may even be found fighting against God . ” He convinced them ,
44005040	and they summoned the apostles and had them beaten . Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them .
44005041	So they left the council rejoicing because they had been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name .
44005042	And every day both in the temple courts and from house to house , they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus was the Christ .
44006001	Now in those days , when the disciples were growing in number , a complaint arose on the part of the Greek-speaking Jews against the native Hebraic Jews , because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food .
44006002	So the twelve called the whole group of the disciples together and said , “ It is not right for us to neglect the word of God to wait on tables .
44006003	But carefully select from among you , brothers , seven men who are well-attested , full of the Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may put in charge of this necessary task .
44006004	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word . ”
44006005	The proposal pleased the entire group , so they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , with Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and Nicolas , a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch .
44006006	They stood these men before the apostles , who prayed and placed their hands on them .
44006007	The word of God continued to spread , the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly , and a large group of priests became obedient to the faith .
44006008	Now Stephen , full of grace and power , was performing great wonders and miraculous signs among the people .
44006009	But some men from the Synagogue of the Freedmen ( as it was called ) , both Cyrenians and Alexandrians , as well as some from Cilicia and the province of Asia , stood up and argued with Stephen .
44006010	Yet they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke .
44006011	Then they secretly instigated some men to say , “ We have heard this man speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God . ”
44006012	They incited the people , the elders , and the experts in the law ; then they approached Stephen , seized him , and brought him before the council .
44006013	They brought forward false witnesses who said , “ This man does not stop saying things against this holy place and the law .
44006014	For we have heard him saying that Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us . ”
44006015	All who were sitting in the council looked intently at Stephen and saw his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	Then the high priest said , “ Are these things true ? ”
44007002	So he replied , “ Brothers and fathers , listen to me . The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia , before he settled in Haran ,
44007003	and said to him , ‘ Go out from your country and from your relatives , and come to the land I will show you . ’
44007004	Then he went out from the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran . After his father died , God made him move to this country where you now live .
44007005	He did not give any of it to him for an inheritance , not even a foot of ground , yet God promised to give it to him as his possession , and to his descendants after him , even though Abraham as yet had no child .
44007006	But God spoke as follows : ‘ Your descendants will be foreigners in a foreign country , whose citizens will enslave them and mistreat them for four hundred years .
44007007	But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves , ’ said God , ‘ and after these things they will come out of there and worship me in this place . ’
44007008	Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision , and so he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him when he was eight days old , and Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	The patriarchs , because they were jealous of Joseph , sold him into Egypt . But God was with him ,
44007010	and rescued him from all his troubles , and granted him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household .
44007011	Then a famine occurred throughout Egypt and Canaan , causing great suffering , and our ancestors could not find food .
44007012	So when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent our ancestors there the first time .
44007013	On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers again , and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh .
44007014	So Joseph sent a message and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come , seventy-five people in all .
44007015	So Jacob went down to Egypt and died there , along with our ancestors ,
44007016	and their bones were later moved to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a certain sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	“ But as the time drew near for God to fulfill the promise he had declared to Abraham , the people increased greatly in number in Egypt ,
44007018	until another king who did not know about Joseph ruled over Egypt .
44007019	This was the one who exploited our people and was cruel to our ancestors , forcing them to abandon their infants so they would die .
44007020	At that time Moses was born , and he was beautiful to God . For three months he was brought up in his father’s house ,
44007021	and when he had been abandoned , Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son .
44007022	So Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds .
44007023	But when he was about forty years old , it entered his mind to visit his fellow countrymen the Israelites .
44007024	When he saw one of them being hurt unfairly , Moses came to his defense and avenged the person who was mistreated by striking down the Egyptian .
44007025	He thought his own people would understand that God was delivering them through him , but they did not understand .
44007026	The next day Moses saw two men fighting , and tried to make peace between them , saying , ‘ Men , you are brothers ; why are you hurting one another ? ’
44007027	But the man who was unfairly hurting his neighbor pushed Moses aside , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and judge over us ?
44007028	You don’t want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday , do you ? ’
44007029	When the man said this , Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
44007030	“ After forty years had passed , an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai , in the flame of a burning bush .
44007031	When Moses saw it , he was amazed at the sight , and when he approached to investigate , there came the voice of the Lord ,
44007032	‘ I am the God of your forefathers , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . ’ Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look more closely .
44007033	But the Lord said to him , ‘ Take the sandals off your feet , for the place where you are standing is holy ground .
44007034	I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning , and I have come down to rescue them . Now come , I will send you to Egypt . ’
44007035	This same Moses they had rejected , saying , ‘ Who made you a ruler and judge ? ’ God sent as both ruler and deliverer through the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
44007036	This man led them out , performing wonders and miraculous signs in the land of Egypt , at the Red Sea , and in the wilderness for forty years .
44007037	This is the Moses who said to the Israelites , ‘ God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers . ’
44007038	This is the man who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai , and with our ancestors , and he received living oracles to give to you .
44007039	Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him , but pushed him aside and turned back to Egypt in their hearts ,
44007040	saying to Aaron , ‘ Make us gods who will go in front of us , for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt – we do not know what has happened to him ! ’
44007041	At that time they made an idol in the form of a calf , brought a sacrifice to the idol , and began rejoicing in the works of their hands .
44007042	But God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the host of heaven , as it is written in the book of the prophets : ‘ It was not to me that you offered slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness , was it , house of Israel ?
44007043	But you took along the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan , the images you made to worship , but I will deport you beyond Babylon . ’
44007044	Our ancestors had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness , just as God who spoke to Moses ordered him to make it according to the design he had seen .
44007045	Our ancestors received possession of it and brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors , until the time of David .
44007046	He found favor with God and asked that he could find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob .
44007047	But Solomon built a house for him .
44007048	Yet the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands , as the prophet says ,
44007049	‘ Heaven is my throne , and earth is the footstool for my feet . What kind of house will you build for me , says the Lord , or what is my resting place ?
44007050	Did my hand not make all these things ? ’
44007051	“ You stubborn people , with uncircumcised hearts and ears ! You are always resisting the Holy Spirit , like your ancestors did !
44007052	Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute ? They killed those who foretold long ago the coming of the Righteous One , whose betrayers and murderers you have now become !
44007053	You received the law by decrees given by angels , but you did not obey it . ”
44007054	When they heard these things , they became furious and ground their teeth at him .
44007055	But Stephen , full of the Holy Spirit , looked intently toward heaven and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing at the right hand of God .
44007056	“ Look ! ” he said . “ I see the heavens opened , and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God ! ”
44007057	But they covered their ears , shouting out with a loud voice , and rushed at him with one intent .
44007058	When they had driven him out of the city , they began to stone him , and the witnesses laid their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	They continued to stone Stephen while he prayed , “ Lord Jesus , receive my spirit ! ”
44007060	Then he fell to his knees and cried out with a loud voice , “ Lord , do not hold this sin against them ! ” When he had said this , he died .
44008001	And Saul agreed completely with killing him . Now on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem , and all except the apostles were forced to scatter throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria .
44008002	Some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him .
44008003	But Saul was trying to destroy the church ; entering one house after another , he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison .
44008004	Now those who had been forced to scatter went around proclaiming the good news of the word .
44008005	Philip went down to the main city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them .
44008006	The crowds were paying attention with one mind to what Philip said , as they heard and saw the miraculous signs he was performing .
44008007	For unclean spirits , crying with loud shrieks , were coming out of many who were possessed , and many paralyzed and lame people were healed .
44008008	So there was great joy in that city .
44008009	Now in that city was a man named Simon , who had been practicing magic and amazing the people of Samaria , claiming to be someone great .
44008010	All the people , from the least to the greatest , paid close attention to him , saying , “ This man is the power of God that is called ‘ Great . ’ ”
44008011	And they paid close attention to him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic .
44008012	But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they began to be baptized , both men and women .
44008013	Even Simon himself believed , and after he was baptized , he stayed close to Philip constantly , and when he saw the signs and great miracles that were occurring , he was amazed .
44008014	Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them .
44008015	These two went down and prayed for them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit .
44008016	( For the Spirit had not yet come upon any of them , but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . )
44008017	Then Peter and John placed their hands on the Samaritans , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Now Simon , when he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands , offered them money ,
44008019	saying , “ Give me this power too , so that everyone I place my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit . ”
44008020	But Peter said to him , “ May your silver perish with you , because you thought you could acquire God’s gift with money !
44008021	You have no share or part in this matter because your heart is not right before God !
44008022	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours , and pray to the Lord that he may perhaps forgive you for the intent of your heart .
44008023	For I see that you are bitterly envious and in bondage to sin . ”
44008024	But Simon replied , “ You pray to the Lord for me so that nothing of what you have said may happen to me . ”
44008025	So after Peter and John had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord , they started back to Jerusalem , proclaiming the good news to many Samaritan villages as they went .
44008026	Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip , “ Get up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . ” ( This is a desert road . )
44008027	So he got up and went . There he met an Ethiopian eunuch , a court official of Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , who was in charge of all her treasury . He had come to Jerusalem to worship ,
44008028	and was returning home , sitting in his chariot , reading the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	Then the Spirit said to Philip , “ Go over and join this chariot . ”
44008030	So Philip ran up to it and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet . He asked him , “ Do you understand what you’re reading ? ”
44008031	The man replied , “ How in the world can I , unless someone guides me ? ” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him .
44008032	Now the passage of scripture the man was reading was this : “ He was led like a sheep to slaughter , and like a lamb before its shearer is silent , so he did not open his mouth .
44008033	In humiliation justice was taken from him . Who can describe his posterity ? For his life was taken away from the earth . ”
44008034	Then the eunuch said to Philip , “ Please tell me , who is the prophet saying this about – himself or someone else ? ”
44008035	So Philip started speaking , and beginning with this scripture proclaimed the good news about Jesus to him .
44008036	Now as they were going along the road , they came to some water , and the eunuch said , “ Look , there is water ! What is to stop me from being baptized ? ”
44008038	So he ordered the chariot to stop , and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water , and Philip baptized him .
44008039	Now when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away , and the eunuch did not see him any more , but went on his way rejoicing .
44008040	Philip , however , found himself at Azotus , and as he passed through the area , he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea .
44009001	Meanwhile Saul , still breathing out threats to murder the Lord’s disciples , went to the high priest
44009002	and requested letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus , so that if he found any who belonged to the Way , either men or women , he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem .
44009003	As he was going along , approaching Damascus , suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him .
44009004	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ”
44009005	So he said , “ Who are you , Lord ? ” He replied , “ I am Jesus whom you are persecuting !
44009006	But stand up and enter the city and you will be told what you must do . ”
44009007	( Now the men who were traveling with him stood there speechless , because they heard the voice but saw no one . )
44009008	So Saul got up from the ground , but although his eyes were open , he could see nothing . Leading him by the hand , his companions brought him into Damascus .
44009009	For three days he could not see , and he neither ate nor drank anything .
44009010	Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias . The Lord said to him in a vision , “ Ananias , ” and he replied , “ Here I am , Lord . ”
44009011	Then the Lord told him , “ Get up and go to the street called ‘ Straight , ’ and at Judas’ house look for a man from Tarsus named Saul . For he is praying ,
44009012	and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and place his hands on him so that he may see again . ”
44009013	But Ananias replied , “ Lord , I have heard from many people about this man , how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem ,
44009014	and here he has authority from the chief priests to imprison all who call on your name ! ”
44009015	But the Lord said to him , “ Go , because this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before Gentiles and kings and the people of Israel .
44009016	For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name . ”
44009017	So Ananias departed and entered the house , placed his hands on Saul and said , “ Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus , who appeared to you on the road as you came here , has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44009018	Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes , and he could see again . He got up and was baptized ,
44009019	and after taking some food , his strength returned . For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus ,
44009020	and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues , saying , “ This man is the Son of God . ”
44009021	All who heard him were amazed and were saying , “ Is this not the man who in Jerusalem was ravaging those who call on this name , and who had come here to bring them as prisoners to the chief priests ? ”
44009022	But Saul became more and more capable , and was causing consternation among the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ .
44009023	Now after some days had passed , the Jews plotted together to kill him ,
44009024	but Saul learned of their plot against him . They were also watching the city gates day and night so that they could kill him .
44009025	But his disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall by lowering him in a basket .
44009026	When he arrived in Jerusalem , he attempted to associate with the disciples , and they were all afraid of him , because they did not believe that he was a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took Saul , brought him to the apostles , and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road , that the Lord had spoken to him , and how in Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus .
44009028	So he was staying with them , associating openly with them in Jerusalem , speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord .
44009029	He was speaking and debating with the Greek-speaking Jews , but they were trying to kill him .
44009030	When the brothers found out about this , they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus .
44009031	Then the church throughout Judea , Galilee , and Samaria experienced peace and thus was strengthened . Living in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit , the church increased in numbers .
44009032	Now as Peter was traveling around from place to place , he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda .
44009033	He found there a man named Aeneas who had been confined to a mattress for eight years because he was paralyzed .
44009034	Peter said to him , “ Aeneas , Jesus the Christ heals you . Get up and make your own bed ! ” And immediately he got up .
44009035	All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him , and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha ( which in translation means Dorcas ) . She was continually doing good deeds and acts of charity .
44009037	At that time she became sick and died . When they had washed her body , they placed it in an upstairs room .
44009038	Because Lydda was near Joppa , when the disciples heard that Peter was there , they sent two men to him and urged him , “ Come to us without delay . ”
44009039	So Peter got up and went with them , and when he arrived they brought him to the upper room . All the widows stood beside him , crying and showing him the tunics and other clothing Dorcas used to make while she was with them .
44009040	But Peter sent them all outside , knelt down , and prayed . Turning to the body , he said , “ Tabitha , get up . ” Then she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	He gave her his hand and helped her get up . Then he called the saints and widows and presented her alive .
44009042	This became known throughout all Joppa , and many believed in the Lord .
44009043	So Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a man named Simon , a tanner .
44010001	Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius , a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort .
44010002	He was a devout , God-fearing man , as was all his household ; he did many acts of charity for the people and prayed to God regularly .
44010003	About three o’clock one afternoon he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God who came in and said to him , “ Cornelius . ”
44010004	Staring at him and becoming greatly afraid , Cornelius replied , “ What is it , Lord ? ” The angel said to him , “ Your prayers and your acts of charity have gone up as a memorial before God .
44010005	Now send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon , who is called Peter .
44010006	This man is staying as a guest with a man named Simon , a tanner , whose house is by the sea . ”
44010007	When the angel who had spoken to him departed , Cornelius called two of his personal servants and a devout soldier from among those who served him ,
44010008	and when he had explained everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	About noon the next day , while they were on their way and approaching the city , Peter went up on the roof to pray .
44010010	He became hungry and wanted to eat , but while they were preparing the meal , a trance came over him .
44010011	He saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet descending , being let down to earth by its four corners .
44010012	In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and wild birds .
44010013	Then a voice said to him , “ Get up , Peter ; slaughter and eat ! ”
44010014	But Peter said , “ Certainly not , Lord , for I have never eaten anything defiled and ritually unclean ! ”
44010015	The voice spoke to him again , a second time , “ What God has made clean , you must not consider ritually unclean ! ”
44010016	This happened three times , and immediately the object was taken up into heaven .
44010017	Now while Peter was puzzling over what the vision he had seen could signify , the men sent by Cornelius had learned where Simon’s house was and approached the gate .
44010018	They called out to ask if Simon , known as Peter , was staying there as a guest .
44010019	While Peter was still thinking seriously about the vision , the Spirit said to him , “ Look ! Three men are looking for you .
44010020	But get up , go down , and accompany them without hesitation , because I have sent them . ”
44010021	So Peter went down to the men and said , “ Here I am , the person you’re looking for . Why have you come ? ”
44010022	They said , “ Cornelius the centurion , a righteous and God-fearing man , well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation , was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear a message from you . ”
44010023	So Peter invited them in and entertained them as guests . On the next day he got up and set out with them , and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	The following day he entered Caesarea . Now Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had called together his relatives and close friends .
44010025	So when Peter came in , Cornelius met him , fell at his feet , and worshiped him .
44010026	But Peter helped him up , saying , “ Stand up . I too am a mere mortal . ”
44010027	Peter continued talking with him as he went in , and he found many people gathered together .
44010028	He said to them , “ You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile , yet God has shown me that I should call no person defiled or ritually unclean .
44010029	Therefore when you sent for me , I came without any objection . Now may I ask why you sent for me ? ”
44010030	Cornelius replied , “ Four days ago at this very hour , at three o’clock in the afternoon , I was praying in my house , and suddenly a man in shining clothing stood before me
44010031	and said , ‘ Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and your acts of charity have been remembered before God .
44010032	Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon , who is called Peter . This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon the tanner , by the sea . ’
44010033	Therefore I sent for you at once , and you were kind enough to come . So now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to say to us . ”
44010034	Then Peter started speaking : “ I now truly understand that God does not show favoritism in dealing with people ,
44010035	but in every nation the person who fears him and does what is right is welcomed before him .
44010036	You know the message he sent to the people of Israel , proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ ( he is Lord of all ) –
44010037	you know what happened throughout Judea , beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John announced :
44010038	with respect to Jesus from Nazareth , that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power . He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , because God was with him .
44010039	We are witnesses of all the things he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem . They killed him by hanging him on a tree ,
44010040	but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen ,
44010041	not by all the people , but by us , the witnesses God had already chosen , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
44010042	He commanded us to preach to the people and to warn them that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	About him all the prophets testify , that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . ”
44010044	While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the message .
44010045	The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were greatly astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles ,
44010046	for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God . Then Peter said ,
44010047	“ No one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized , who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did , can he ? ”
44010048	So he gave orders to have them baptized in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they asked him to stay for several days .
44011001	Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles too had accepted the word of God .
44011002	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem , the circumcised believers took issue with him ,
44011003	saying , “ You went to uncircumcised men and shared a meal with them . ”
44011004	But Peter began and explained it to them point by point , saying ,
44011005	“ I was in the city of Joppa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision , an object something like a large sheet descending , being let down from heaven by its four corners , and it came to me .
44011006	As I stared I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth , wild animals , reptiles , and wild birds .
44011007	I also heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Get up , Peter ; slaughter and eat ! ’
44011008	But I said , ‘ Certainly not , Lord , for nothing defiled or ritually unclean has ever entered my mouth ! ’
44011009	But the voice replied a second time from heaven , ‘ What God has made clean , you must not consider ritually unclean ! ’
44011010	This happened three times , and then everything was pulled up to heaven again .
44011011	At that very moment , three men sent to me from Caesarea approached the house where we were staying .
44011012	The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation . These six brothers also went with me , and we entered the man’s house .
44011013	He informed us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying , ‘ Send to Joppa and summon Simon , who is called Peter ,
44011014	who will speak a message to you by which you and your entire household will be saved . ’
44011015	Then as I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he did on us at the beginning .
44011016	And I remembered the word of the Lord , as he used to say , ‘ John baptized with water , but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . ’
44011017	Therefore if God gave them the same gift as he also gave us after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I to hinder God ? ”
44011018	When they heard this , they ceased their objections and praised God , saying , “ So then , God has granted the repentance that leads to life even to the Gentiles . ”
44011019	Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , speaking the message to no one but Jews .
44011020	But there were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene among them who came to Antioch and began to speak to the Greeks too , proclaiming the good news of the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number who believed turned to the Lord .
44011022	A report about them came to the attention of the church in Jerusalem , and they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he came and saw the grace of God , he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with devoted hearts ,
44011024	because he was a good man , full of the Holy Spirit and of faith , and a significant number of people were brought to the Lord .
44011025	Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to look for Saul ,
44011026	and when he found him , he brought him to Antioch . So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught a significant number of people . Now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians .
44011027	At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	One of them , named Agabus , got up and predicted by the Spirit that a severe famine was about to come over the whole inhabited world . ( This took place during the reign of Claudius . )
44011029	So the disciples , each in accordance with his financial ability , decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea .
44011030	They did so , sending their financial aid to the elders by Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	About that time King Herod laid hands on some from the church to harm them .
44012002	He had James , the brother of John , executed with a sword .
44012003	When he saw that this pleased the Jews , he proceeded to arrest Peter too . ( This took place during the feast of Unleavened Bread . )
44012004	When he had seized him , he put him in prison , handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him . Herod planned to bring him out for public trial after the Passover .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison , but those in the church were earnestly praying to God for him .
44012006	On that very night before Herod was going to bring him out for trial , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains , while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison .
44012007	Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared , and a light shone in the prison cell . He struck Peter on the side and woke him up , saying , “ Get up quickly ! ” And the chains fell off Peter’s wrists .
44012008	The angel said to him , “ Fasten your belt and put on your sandals . ” Peter did so . Then the angel said to him , “ Put on your cloak and follow me . ”
44012009	Peter went out and followed him ; he did not realize that what was happening through the angel was real , but thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	After they had passed the first and second guards , they came to the iron gate leading into the city . It opened for them by itself , and they went outside and walked down one narrow street , when at once the angel left him .
44012011	When Peter came to himself , he said , “ Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting to happen . ”
44012012	When Peter realized this , he went to the house of Mary , the mother of John Mark , where many people had gathered together and were praying .
44012013	When he knocked at the door of the outer gate , a slave girl named Rhoda answered .
44012014	When she recognized Peter’s voice , she was so overjoyed she did not open the gate , but ran back in and told them that Peter was standing at the gate .
44012015	But they said to her , “ You’ve lost your mind ! ” But she kept insisting that it was Peter , and they kept saying , “ It is his angel ! ”
44012016	Now Peter continued knocking , and when they opened the door and saw him , they were greatly astonished .
44012017	He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet and then related how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . He said , “ Tell James and the brothers these things , ” and then he left and went to another place .
44012018	At daybreak there was great consternation among the soldiers over what had become of Peter .
44012019	When Herod had searched for him and did not find him , he questioned the guards and commanded that they be led away to execution . Then Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there .
44012020	Now Herod was having an angry quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon . So they joined together and presented themselves before him . And after convincing Blastus , the king’s personal assistant , to help them , they asked for peace , because their country’s food supply was provided by the king’s country .
44012021	On a day determined in advance , Herod put on his royal robes , sat down on the judgment seat , and made a speech to them .
44012022	But the crowd began to shout , “ The voice of a god , and not of a man ! ”
44012023	Immediately an angel of the Lord struck Herod down because he did not give the glory to God , and he was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	But the word of God kept on increasing and multiplying .
44012025	So Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem when they had completed their mission , bringing along with them John Mark .
44013001	Now there were these prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch : Barnabas , Simeon called Niger , Lucius the Cyrenian , Manaen ( a close friend of Herod the tetrarch from childhood ) and Saul .
44013002	While they were serving the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , “ Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them . ”
44013003	Then , after they had fasted and prayed and placed their hands on them , they sent them off .
44013004	So Barnabas and Saul , sent out by the Holy Spirit , went down to Seleucia , and from there they sailed to Cyprus .
44013005	When they arrived in Salamis , they began to proclaim the word of God in the Jewish synagogues . ( Now they also had John as their assistant . )
44013006	When they had crossed over the whole island as far as Paphos , they found a magician , a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus ,
44013007	who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus , an intelligent man . The proconsul summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word of God .
44013008	But the magician Elymas ( for that is the way his name is translated ) opposed them , trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith .
44013009	But Saul ( also known as Paul ) , filled with the Holy Spirit , stared straight at him
44013010	and said , “ You who are full of all deceit and all wrongdoing , you son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness – will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord ?
44013011	Now look , the hand of the Lord is against you , and you will be blind , unable to see the sun for a time ! ” Immediately mistiness and darkness came over him , and he went around seeking people to lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then when the proconsul saw what had happened , he believed , because he was greatly astounded at the teaching about the Lord .
44013013	Then Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia , but John left them and returned to Jerusalem .
44013014	Moving on from Perga , they arrived at Pisidian Antioch , and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	After the reading from the law and the prophets , the leaders of the synagogue sent them a message , saying , “ Brothers , if you have any message of exhortation for the people , speak it . ”
44013016	So Paul stood up , gestured with his hand and said , “ Men of Israel , and you Gentiles who fear God , listen :
44013017	The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay as foreigners in the country of Egypt , and with uplifted arm he led them out of it .
44013018	For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness .
44013019	After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave his people their land as an inheritance .
44013020	All this took about four hundred fifty years . After this he gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet .
44013021	Then they asked for a king , and God gave them Saul son of Kish , a man from the tribe of Benjamin , who ruled forty years .
44013022	After removing him , God raised up David their king . He testified about him : ‘ I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man after my heart , who will accomplish everything I want him to do . ’
44013023	From the descendants of this man God brought to Israel a Savior , Jesus , just as he promised .
44013024	Before Jesus arrived , John had proclaimed a baptism for repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	But while John was completing his mission , he said repeatedly , ‘ What do you think I am ? I am not he . But look , one is coming after me . I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet ! ’
44013026	Brothers , descendants of Abraham’s family , and those Gentiles among you who fear God , the message of this salvation has been sent to us .
44013027	For the people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize him , and they fulfilled the sayings of the prophets that are read every Sabbath by condemning him .
44013028	Though they found no basis for a death sentence , they asked Pilate to have him executed .
44013029	When they had accomplished everything that was written about him , they took him down from the cross and placed him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised him from the dead ,
44013031	and for many days he appeared to those who had accompanied him from Galilee to Jerusalem . These are now his witnesses to the people .
44013032	And we proclaim to you the good news about the promise to our ancestors ,
44013033	that this promise God has fulfilled to us , their children , by raising Jesus , as also it is written in the second psalm , ‘ You are my Son ; today I have fathered you . ’
44013034	But regarding the fact that he has raised Jesus from the dead , never again to be in a state of decay , God has spoken in this way : ‘ I will give you the holy and trustworthy promises made to David . ’
44013035	Therefore he also says in another psalm , ‘ You will not permit your Holy One to experience decay . ’
44013036	For David , after he had served God’s purpose in his own generation , died , was buried with his ancestors , and experienced decay ,
44013037	but the one whom God raised up did not experience decay .
44013038	Therefore let it be known to you , brothers , that through this one forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you ,
44013039	and by this one everyone who believes is justified from everything from which the law of Moses could not justify you .
44013040	Watch out , then , that what is spoken about by the prophets does not happen to you :
44013041	‘ Look , you scoffers ; be amazed and perish ! For I am doing a work in your days , a work you would never believe , even if someone tells you . ’ ”
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas were going out , the people were urging them to speak about these things on the next Sabbath .
44013043	When the meeting of the synagogue had broken up , many of the Jews and God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas , who were speaking with them and were persuading them to continue in the grace of God .
44013044	On the next Sabbath almost the whole city assembled together to hear the word of the Lord .
44013045	But when the Jews saw the crowds , they were filled with jealousy , and they began to contradict what Paul was saying by reviling him .
44013046	Both Paul and Barnabas replied courageously , “ It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first . Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life , we are turning to the Gentiles .
44013047	For this is what the Lord has commanded us : ‘ I have appointed you to be a light for the Gentiles , to bring salvation to the ends of the earth . ’ ”
44013048	When the Gentiles heard this , they began to rejoice and praise the word of the Lord , and all who had been appointed for eternal life believed .
44013049	So the word of the Lord was spreading through the entire region .
44013050	But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high social standing and the prominent men of the city , stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and threw them out of their region .
44013051	So after they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them , they went to Iconium .
44013052	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	The same thing happened in Iconium when Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a large group of both Jews and Greeks believed .
44014002	But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers .
44014003	So they stayed there for a considerable time , speaking out courageously for the Lord , who testified to the message of his grace , granting miraculous signs and wonders to be performed through their hands .
44014004	But the population of the city was divided ; some sided with the Jews , and some with the apostles .
44014005	When both the Gentiles and the Jews ( together with their rulers ) made an attempt to mistreat them and stone them ,
44014006	Paul and Barnabas learned about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding region .
44014007	There they continued to proclaim the good news .
44014008	In Lystra sat a man who could not use his feet , lame from birth , who had never walked .
44014009	This man was listening to Paul as he was speaking . When Paul stared intently at him and saw he had faith to be healed ,
44014010	he said with a loud voice , “ Stand upright on your feet . ” And the man leaped up and began walking .
44014011	So when the crowds saw what Paul had done , they shouted in the Lycaonian language , “ The gods have come down to us in human form ! ”
44014012	They began to call Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes , because he was the chief speaker .
44014013	The priest of the temple of Zeus , located just outside the city , brought bulls and garlands to the city gates ; he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices to them .
44014014	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it , they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd , shouting ,
44014015	“ Men , why are you doing these things ? We too are men , with human natures just like you ! We are proclaiming the good news to you , so that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God , who made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and everything that is in them .
44014016	In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways ,
44014017	yet he did not leave himself without a witness by doing good , by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons , satisfying you with food and your hearts with joy . ”
44014018	Even by saying these things , they scarcely persuaded the crowds not to offer sacrifice to them .
44014019	But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium , and after winning the crowds over , they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city , presuming him to be dead .
44014020	But after the disciples had surrounded him , he got up and went back into the city . On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe .
44014021	After they had proclaimed the good news in that city and made many disciples , they returned to Lystra , to Iconium , and to Antioch .
44014022	They strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith , saying , “ We must enter the kingdom of God through many persecutions . ”
44014023	When they had appointed elders for them in the various churches , with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the protection of the Lord in whom they had believed .
44014024	Then they passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia ,
44014025	and when they had spoken the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia .
44014026	From there they sailed back to Antioch , where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had now completed .
44014027	When they arrived and gathered the church together , they reported all the things God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles .
44014028	So they spent considerable time with the disciples .
44015001	Now some men came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers , “ Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved . ”
44015002	When Paul and Barnabas had a major argument and debate with them , the church appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to meet with the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this point of disagreement .
44015003	So they were sent on their way by the church , and as they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria , they were relating at length the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers .
44015004	When they arrived in Jerusalem , they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders , and they reported all the things God had done with them .
44015005	But some from the religious party of the Pharisees who had believed stood up and said , “ It is necessary to circumcise the Gentiles and to order them to observe the law of Moses . ”
44015006	Both the apostles and the elders met together to deliberate about this matter .
44015007	After there had been much debate , Peter stood up and said to them , “ Brothers , you know that some time ago God chose me to preach to the Gentiles so they would hear the message of the gospel and believe .
44015008	And God , who knows the heart , has testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us ,
44015009	and he made no distinction between them and us , cleansing their hearts by faith .
44015010	So now why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear ?
44015011	On the contrary , we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus , in the same way as they are . ”
44015012	The whole group kept quiet and listened to Barnabas and Paul while they explained all the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them .
44015013	After they stopped speaking , James replied , “ Brothers , listen to me .
44015014	Simeon has explained how God first concerned himself to select from among the Gentiles a people for his name .
44015015	The words of the prophets agree with this , as it is written ,
44015016	‘ After this I will return , and I will rebuild the fallen tent of David ; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it ,
44015017	so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord , namely , all the Gentiles I have called to be my own , ’ says the Lord , who makes these things
44015018	known from long ago .
44015019	“ Therefore I conclude that we should not cause extra difficulty for those among the Gentiles who are turning to God ,
44015020	but that we should write them a letter telling them to abstain from things defiled by idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood .
44015021	For Moses has had those who proclaim him in every town from ancient times , because he is read aloud in the synagogues every Sabbath . ”
44015022	Then the apostles and elders , with the whole church , decided to send men chosen from among them , Judas called Barsabbas and Silas , leaders among the brothers , to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas .
44015023	They sent this letter with them :
44015030	So when they were dismissed , they went down to Antioch , and after gathering the entire group together , they delivered the letter .
44015031	When they read it aloud , the people rejoiced at its encouragement .
44015032	Both Judas and Silas , who were prophets themselves , encouraged and strengthened the brothers with a long speech .
44015033	After they had spent some time there , they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them .
44015035	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch , teaching and proclaiming ( along with many others ) the word of the Lord .
44015036	After some days Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let’s return and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord to see how they are doing . ”
44015037	Barnabas wanted to bring John called Mark along with them too ,
44015038	but Paul insisted that they should not take along this one who had left them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work .
44015039	They had a sharp disagreement , so that they parted company . Barnabas took along Mark and sailed away to Cyprus ,
44015040	but Paul chose Silas and set out , commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers and sisters .
44015041	He passed through Syria and Cilicia , strengthening the churches .
44016001	He also came to Derbe and to Lystra . A disciple named Timothy was there , the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer , but whose father was a Greek .
44016002	The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him .
44016003	Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him , and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places , for they all knew that his father was Greek .
44016004	As they went through the towns , they passed on the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the Gentile believers to obey .
44016005	So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number every day .
44016006	They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia , having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in the province of Asia .
44016007	When they came to Mysia , they attempted to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to do this ,
44016008	so they passed through Mysia and went down to Troas .
44016009	A vision appeared to Paul during the night : A Macedonian man was standing there urging him , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us ! ”
44016010	After Paul saw the vision , we attempted immediately to go over to Macedonia , concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them .
44016011	We put out to sea from Troas and sailed a straight course to Samothrace , the next day to Neapolis ,
44016012	and from there to Philippi , which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia , a Roman colony . We stayed in this city for some days .
44016013	On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the side of the river , where we thought there would be a place of prayer , and we sat down and began to speak to the women who had assembled there .
44016014	A woman named Lydia , a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira , a God-fearing woman , listened to us . The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying .
44016015	After she and her household were baptized , she urged us , “ If you consider me to be a believer in the Lord , come and stay in my house . ” And she persuaded us .
44016016	Now as we were going to the place of prayer , a slave girl met us who had a spirit that enabled her to foretell the future by supernatural means . She brought her owners a great profit by fortune-telling .
44016017	She followed behind Paul and us and kept crying out , “ These men are servants of the Most High God , who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation . ”
44016018	She continued to do this for many days . But Paul became greatly annoyed , and turned and said to the spirit , “ I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! ” And it came out of her at once .
44016019	But when her owners saw their hope of profit was gone , they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities .
44016020	When they had brought them before the magistrates , they said , “ These men are throwing our city into confusion . They are Jews
44016021	and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us to accept or practice , since we are Romans . ”
44016022	The crowd joined the attack against them , and the magistrates tore the clothes off Paul and Silas and ordered them to be beaten with rods .
44016023	After they had beaten them severely , they threw them into prison and commanded the jailer to guard them securely .
44016024	Receiving such orders , he threw them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks .
44016025	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God , and the rest of the prisoners were listening to them .
44016026	Suddenly a great earthquake occurred , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken . Immediately all the doors flew open , and the bonds of all the prisoners came loose .
44016027	When the jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison standing open , he drew his sword and was about to kill himself , because he assumed the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul called out loudly , “ Do not harm yourself , for we are all here ! ”
44016029	Calling for lights , the jailer rushed in and fell down trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas .
44016030	Then he brought them outside and asked , “ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44016031	They replied , “ Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved , you and your household . ”
44016032	Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him , along with all those who were in his house .
44016033	At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds ; then he and all his family were baptized right away .
44016034	The jailer brought them into his house and set food before them , and he rejoiced greatly that he had come to believe in God , together with his entire household .
44016035	At daybreak the magistrates sent their police officers , saying , “ Release those men . ”
44016036	The jailer reported these words to Paul , saying , “ The magistrates have sent orders to release you . So come out now and go in peace . ”
44016037	But Paul said to the police officers , “ They had us beaten in public without a proper trial – even though we are Roman citizens – and they threw us in prison . And now they want to send us away secretly ? Absolutely not ! They themselves must come and escort us out ! ”
44016038	The police officers reported these words to the magistrates . They were frightened when they heard Paul and Silas were Roman citizens
44016039	and came and apologized to them . After they brought them out , they asked them repeatedly to leave the city .
44016040	When they came out of the prison , they entered Lydia’s house , and when they saw the brothers , they encouraged them and then departed .
44017001	After they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
44017002	Paul went to the Jews in the synagogue , as he customarily did , and on three Sabbath days he addressed them from the scriptures ,
44017003	explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and to rise from the dead , saying , “ This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ . ”
44017004	Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas , along with a large group of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women .
44017005	But the Jews became jealous , and gathering together some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace , they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar . They attacked Jason’s house , trying to find Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly .
44017006	When they did not find them , they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city officials , screaming , “ These people who have stirred up trouble throughout the world have come here too ,
44017007	and Jason has welcomed them as guests ! They are all acting against Caesar’s decrees , saying there is another king named Jesus ! ”
44017008	They caused confusion among the crowd and the city officials who heard these things .
44017009	After the city officials had received bail from Jason and the others , they released them .
44017010	The brothers sent Paul and Silas off to Berea at once , during the night . When they arrived , they went to the Jewish synagogue .
44017011	These Jews were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica , for they eagerly received the message , examining the scriptures carefully every day to see if these things were so .
44017012	Therefore many of them believed , along with quite a few prominent Greek women and men .
44017013	But when the Jews from Thessalonica heard that Paul had also proclaimed the word of God in Berea , they came there too , inciting and disturbing the crowds .
44017014	Then the brothers sent Paul away to the coast at once , but Silas and Timothy remained in Berea .
44017015	Those who accompanied Paul escorted him as far as Athens , and after receiving an order for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible , they left .
44017016	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens , his spirit was greatly upset because he saw the city was full of idols .
44017017	So he was addressing the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles in the synagogue , and in the marketplace every day those who happened to be there .
44017018	Also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him , and some were asking , “ What does this foolish babbler want to say ? ” Others said , “ He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods . ” ( They said this because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection . )
44017019	So they took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus , saying , “ May we know what this new teaching is that you are proclaiming ?
44017020	For you are bringing some surprising things to our ears , so we want to know what they mean . ”
44017021	( All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there used to spend their time in nothing else than telling or listening to something new . )
44017022	So Paul stood before the Areopagus and said , “ Men of Athens , I see that you are very religious in all respects .
44017023	For as I went around and observed closely your objects of worship , I even found an altar with this inscription : ‘ To an unknown god . ’ Therefore what you worship without knowing it , this I proclaim to you .
44017024	The God who made the world and everything in it , who is Lord of heaven and earth , does not live in temples made by human hands ,
44017025	nor is he served by human hands , as if he needed anything , because he himself gives life and breath and everything to everyone .
44017026	From one man he made every nation of the human race to inhabit the entire earth , determining their set times and the fixed limits of the places where they would live ,
44017027	so that they would search for God and perhaps grope around for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
44017028	For in him we live and move about and exist , as even some of your own poets have said , ‘ For we too are his offspring . ’
44017029	So since we are God’s offspring , we should not think the deity is like gold or silver or stone , an image made by human skill and imagination .
44017030	Therefore , although God has overlooked such times of ignorance , he now commands all people everywhere to repent ,
44017031	because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness , by a man whom he designated , having provided proof to everyone by raising him from the dead . ”
44017032	Now when they heard about the resurrection from the dead , some began to scoff , but others said , “ We will hear you again about this . ”
44017033	So Paul left the Areopagus .
44017034	But some people joined him and believed . Among them were Dionysius , who was a member of the Areopagus , a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
44018001	After this Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	There he found a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus , who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome . Paul approached them ,
44018003	and because he worked at the same trade , he stayed with them and worked with them ( for they were tentmakers by trade ) .
44018004	He addressed both Jews and Greeks in the synagogue every Sabbath , attempting to persuade them .
44018005	Now when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul became wholly absorbed with proclaiming the word , testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ .
44018006	When they opposed him and reviled him , he protested by shaking out his clothes and said to them , “ Your blood be on your own heads ! I am guiltless ! From now on I will go to the Gentiles ! ”
44018007	Then Paul left the synagogue and went to the house of a person named Titius Justus , a Gentile who worshiped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus , the president of the synagogue , believed in the Lord together with his entire household , and many of the Corinthians who heard about it believed and were baptized .
44018009	The Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night , “ Do not be afraid , but speak and do not be silent ,
44018010	because I am with you , and no one will assault you to harm you , because I have many people in this city . ”
44018011	So he stayed there a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
44018012	Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia , the Jews attacked Paul together and brought him before the judgment seat ,
44018013	saying , “ This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law ! ”
44018014	But just as Paul was about to speak , Gallio said to the Jews , “ If it were a matter of some crime or serious piece of villainy , I would have been justified in accepting the complaint of you Jews ,
44018015	but since it concerns points of disagreement about words and names and your own law , settle it yourselves . I will not be a judge of these things ! ”
44018016	Then he had them forced away from the judgment seat .
44018017	So they all seized Sosthenes , the president of the synagogue , and began to beat him in front of the judgment seat . Yet none of these things were of any concern to Gallio .
44018018	Paul , after staying many more days in Corinth , said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila . He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because he had made a vow .
44018019	When they reached Ephesus , Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind there , but he himself went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews .
44018020	When they asked him to stay longer , he would not consent ,
44018021	but said farewell to them and added , “ I will come back to you again if God wills . ” Then he set sail from Ephesus ,
44018022	and when he arrived at Caesarea , he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem and then went down to Antioch .
44018023	After he spent some time there , Paul left and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia , strengthening all the disciples .
44018024	Now a Jew named Apollos , a native of Alexandria , arrived in Ephesus . He was an eloquent speaker , well-versed in the scriptures .
44018025	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord , and with great enthusiasm he spoke and taught accurately the facts about Jesus , although he knew only the baptism of John .
44018026	He began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue , but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately .
44018027	When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia , the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him . When he arrived , he assisted greatly those who had believed by grace ,
44018028	for he refuted the Jews vigorously in public debate , demonstrating from the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus .
44019001	While Apollos was in Corinth , Paul went through the inland regions and came to Ephesus . He found some disciples there
44019002	and said to them , “ Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ” They replied , “ No , we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . ”
44019003	So Paul said , “ Into what then were you baptized ? ” “ Into John’s baptism , ” they replied .
44019004	Paul said , “ John baptized with a baptism of repentance , telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him , that is , in Jesus . ”
44019005	When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus ,
44019006	and when Paul placed his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came upon them , and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy .
44019007	( Now there were about twelve men in all . )
44019008	So Paul entered the synagogue and spoke out fearlessly for three months , addressing and convincing them about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when some were stubborn and refused to believe , reviling the Way before the congregation , he left them and took the disciples with him , addressing them every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus .
44019010	This went on for two years , so that all who lived in the province of Asia , both Jews and Greeks , heard the word of the Lord .
44019011	God was performing extraordinary miracles by Paul’s hands ,
44019012	so that when even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body were brought to the sick , their diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them .
44019013	But some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were possessed by evil spirits , saying , “ I sternly warn you by Jesus whom Paul preaches . ”
44019014	( Now seven sons of a man named Sceva , a Jewish high priest , were doing this . )
44019015	But the evil spirit replied to them , “ I know about Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul , but who are you ? ”
44019016	Then the man who was possessed by the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them all into submission . He prevailed against them so that they fled from that house naked and wounded .
44019017	This became known to all who lived in Ephesus , both Jews and Greeks ; fear came over them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was praised .
44019018	Many of those who had believed came forward , confessing and making their deeds known .
44019019	Large numbers of those who had practiced magic collected their books and burned them up in the presence of everyone . When the value of the books was added up , it was found to total fifty thousand silver coins .
44019020	In this way the word of the Lord continued to grow in power and to prevail .
44019021	Now after all these things had taken place , Paul resolved to go to Jerusalem , passing through Macedonia and Achaia . He said , “ After I have been there , I must also see Rome . ”
44019022	So after sending two of his assistants , Timothy and Erastus , to Macedonia , he himself stayed on for a while in the province of Asia .
44019023	At that time a great disturbance took place concerning the Way .
44019024	For a man named Demetrius , a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis , brought a great deal of business to the craftsmen .
44019025	He gathered these together , along with the workmen in similar trades , and said , “ Men , you know that our prosperity comes from this business .
44019026	And you see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a large crowd , not only in Ephesus but in practically all of the province of Asia , by saying that gods made by hands are not gods at all .
44019027	There is danger not only that this business of ours will come into disrepute , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing , and she whom all the province of Asia and the world worship will suffer the loss of her greatness . ”
44019028	When they heard this they became enraged and began to shout , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ”
44019029	The city was filled with the uproar , and the crowd rushed to the theater together , dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus , the Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions .
44019030	But when Paul wanted to enter the public assembly , the disciples would not let him .
44019031	Even some of the provincial authorities who were his friends sent a message to him , urging him not to venture into the theater .
44019032	So then some were shouting one thing , some another , for the assembly was in confusion , and most of them did not know why they had met together .
44019033	Some of the crowd concluded it was about Alexander because the Jews had pushed him to the front . Alexander , gesturing with his hand , was wanting to make a defense before the public assembly .
44019034	But when they recognized that he was a Jew , they all shouted in unison , “ Great is Artemis of the Ephesians ! ” for about two hours .
44019035	After the city secretary quieted the crowd , he said , “ Men of Ephesus , what person is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image that fell from heaven ?
44019036	So because these facts are indisputable , you must keep quiet and not do anything reckless .
44019037	For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess .
44019038	If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against someone , the courts are open and there are proconsuls ; let them bring charges against one another there .
44019039	But if you want anything in addition , it will have to be settled in a legal assembly .
44019040	For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today , since there is no cause we can give to explain this disorderly gathering . ”
44019041	After he had said this , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	After the disturbance had ended , Paul sent for the disciples , and after encouraging them and saying farewell , he left to go to Macedonia .
44020002	After he had gone through those regions and spoken many words of encouragement to the believers there , he came to Greece ,
44020003	where he stayed for three months . Because the Jews had made a plot against him as he was intending to sail for Syria , he decided to return through Macedonia .
44020004	Paul was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea , Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica , Gaius from Derbe , and Timothy , as well as Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia .
44020005	These had gone on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas .
44020006	We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread , and within five days we came to the others in Troas , where we stayed for seven days .
44020007	On the first day of the week , when we met to break bread , Paul began to speak to the people , and because he intended to leave the next day , he extended his message until midnight .
44020008	( Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting . )
44020009	A young man named Eutychus , who was sitting in the window , was sinking into a deep sleep while Paul continued to speak for a long time . Fast asleep , he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead .
44020010	But Paul went down , threw himself on the young man , put his arms around him , and said , “ Do not be distressed , for he is still alive ! ”
44020011	Then Paul went back upstairs , and after he had broken bread and eaten , he talked with them a long time , until dawn . Then he left .
44020012	They took the boy home alive and were greatly comforted .
44020013	We went on ahead to the ship and put out to sea for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for he had arranged it this way . He himself was intending to go there by land .
44020014	When he met us in Assos , we took him aboard and went to Mitylene .
44020015	We set sail from there , and on the following day we arrived off Chios . The next day we approached Samos , and the day after that we arrived at Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so as not to spend time in the province of Asia , for he was hurrying to arrive in Jerusalem , if possible , by the day of Pentecost .
44020017	From Miletus he sent a message to Ephesus , telling the elders of the church to come to him .
44020018	When they arrived , he said to them , “ You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you , from the first day I set foot in the province of Asia ,
44020019	serving the Lord with all humility and with tears , and with the trials that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews .
44020020	You know that I did not hold back from proclaiming to you anything that would be helpful , and from teaching you publicly and from house to house ,
44020021	testifying to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus .
44020022	And now , compelled by the Spirit , I am going to Jerusalem without knowing what will happen to me there ,
44020023	except that the Holy Spirit warns me in town after town that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me .
44020024	But I do not consider my life worth anything to myself , so that I may finish my task and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus , to testify to the good news of God’s grace .
44020025	“ And now I know that none of you among whom I went around proclaiming the kingdom will see me again .
44020026	Therefore I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of you all .
44020027	For I did not hold back from announcing to you the whole purpose of God .
44020028	Watch out for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the church of God that he obtained with the blood of his own Son .
44020029	I know that after I am gone fierce wolves will come in among you , not sparing the flock .
44020030	Even from among your own group men will arise , teaching perversions of the truth to draw the disciples away after them .
44020031	Therefore be alert , remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you with tears .
44020032	And now I entrust you to God and to the message of his grace . This message is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified .
44020033	I have desired no one’s silver or gold or clothing .
44020034	You yourselves know that these hands of mine provided for my needs and the needs of those who were with me .
44020035	By all these things , I have shown you that by working in this way we must help the weak , and remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said , ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive . ’ ”
44020036	When he had said these things , he knelt down with them all and prayed .
44020037	They all began to weep loudly , and hugged Paul and kissed him ,
44020038	especially saddened by what he had said , that they were not going to see him again . Then they accompanied him to the ship .
44021001	After we tore ourselves away from them , we put out to sea , and sailing a straight course , we came to Cos , on the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Patara .
44021002	We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia , went aboard , and put out to sea .
44021003	After we sighted Cyprus and left it behind on our port side , we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre , because the ship was to unload its cargo there .
44021004	After we located the disciples , we stayed there seven days . They repeatedly told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem .
44021005	When our time was over , we left and went on our way . All of them , with their wives and children , accompanied us outside of the city . After kneeling down on the beach and praying ,
44021006	we said farewell to one another . Then we went aboard the ship , and they returned to their own homes .
44021007	We continued the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais , and when we had greeted the brothers , we stayed with them for one day .
44021008	On the next day we left and came to Caesarea , and entered the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
44021009	( He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied . )
44021010	While we remained there for a number of days , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	He came to us , took Paul’s belt , tied his own hands and feet with it , and said , “ The Holy Spirit says this : ‘ This is the way the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man whose belt this is , and will hand him over to the Gentiles . ’ ”
44021012	When we heard this , both we and the local people begged him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul replied , “ What are you doing , weeping and breaking my heart ? For I am ready not only to be tied up , but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . ”
44021014	Because he could not be persuaded , we said no more except , “ The Lord’s will be done . ”
44021015	After these days we got ready and started up to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the disciples from Caesarea came along with us too , and brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus , a disciple from the earliest times , with whom we were to stay .
44021017	When we arrived in Jerusalem , the brothers welcomed us gladly .
44021018	The next day Paul went in with us to see James , and all the elders were there .
44021019	When Paul had greeted them , he began to explain in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44021020	When they heard this , they praised God . Then they said to him , “ You see , brother , how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed , and they are all ardent observers of the law .
44021021	They have been informed about you – that you teach all the Jews now living among the Gentiles to abandon Moses , telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs .
44021022	What then should we do ? They will no doubt hear that you have come .
44021023	So do what we tell you : We have four men who have taken a vow ;
44021024	take them and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses , so that they may have their heads shaved . Then everyone will know there is nothing in what they have been told about you , but that you yourself live in conformity with the law .
44021025	But regarding the Gentiles who have believed , we have written a letter , having decided that they should avoid meat that has been sacrificed to idols and blood and what has been strangled and sexual immorality . ”
44021026	Then Paul took the men the next day , and after he had purified himself along with them , he went to the temple and gave notice of the completion of the days of purification , when the sacrifice would be offered for each of them .
44021027	When the seven days were almost over , the Jews from the province of Asia who had seen him in the temple area stirred up the whole crowd and seized him ,
44021028	shouting , “ Men of Israel , help ! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people , our law , and this sanctuary ! Furthermore he has brought Greeks into the inner courts of the temple and made this holy place ritually unclean ! ”
44021029	( For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him previously , and they assumed Paul had brought him into the inner temple courts . )
44021030	The whole city was stirred up , and the people rushed together . They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple courts , and immediately the doors were shut .
44021031	While they were trying to kill him , a report was sent up to the commanding officer of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion .
44021032	He immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd . When they saw the commanding officer and the soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the commanding officer came up and arrested him and ordered him to be tied up with two chains ; he then asked who he was and what he had done .
44021034	But some in the crowd shouted one thing , and others something else , and when the commanding officer was unable to find out the truth because of the disturbance , he ordered Paul to be brought into the barracks .
44021035	When he came to the steps , Paul had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob ,
44021036	for a crowd of people followed them , screaming , “ Away with him ! ”
44021037	As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks , he said to the commanding officer , “ May I say something to you ? ” The officer replied , “ Do you know Greek ?
44021038	Then you’re not that Egyptian who started a rebellion and led the four thousand men of the ‘ Assassins’ into the wilderness some time ago ? ”
44021039	Paul answered , “ I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of an important city . Please allow me to speak to the people . ”
44021040	When the commanding officer had given him permission , Paul stood on the steps and gestured to the people with his hand . When they had become silent , he addressed them in Aramaic ,
44022001	“ Brothers and fathers , listen to my defense that I now make to you . ”
44022002	( When they heard that he was addressing them in Aramaic , they became even quieter . ) Then Paul said ,
44022003	“ I am a Jew , born in Tarsus in Cilicia , but brought up in this city , educated with strictness under Gamaliel according to the law of our ancestors , and was zealous for God just as all of you are today .
44022004	I persecuted this Way even to the point of death , tying up both men and women and putting them in prison ,
44022005	as both the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me . From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus , and I was on my way to make arrests there and bring the prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished .
44022006	As I was en route and near Damascus , about noon a very bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me .
44022007	Then I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? ’
44022008	I answered , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ He said to me , ‘ I am Jesus the Nazarene , whom you are persecuting . ’
44022009	Those who were with me saw the light , but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me .
44022010	So I asked , ‘ What should I do , Lord ? ’ The Lord said to me , ‘ Get up and go to Damascus ; there you will be told about everything that you have been designated to do . ’
44022011	Since I could not see because of the brilliance of that light , I came to Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me .
44022012	A man named Ananias , a devout man according to the law , well spoken of by all the Jews who live there ,
44022013	came to me and stood beside me and said to me , ‘ Brother Saul , regain your sight ! ’ And at that very moment I looked up and saw him .
44022014	Then he said , ‘ The God of our ancestors has already chosen you to know his will , to see the Righteous One , and to hear a command from his mouth ,
44022015	because you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard .
44022016	And now what are you waiting for ? Get up , be baptized , and have your sins washed away , calling on his name . ’
44022017	When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple , I fell into a trance
44022018	and saw the Lord saying to me , ‘ Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly , because they will not accept your testimony about me . ’
44022019	I replied , ‘ Lord , they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those in the various synagogues who believed in you .
44022020	And when the blood of your witness Stephen was shed , I myself was standing nearby , approving , and guarding the cloaks of those who were killing him . ’
44022021	Then he said to me , ‘ Go , because I will send you far away to the Gentiles . ’ ”
44022022	The crowd was listening to him until he said this . Then they raised their voices and shouted , “ Away with this man from the earth ! For he should not be allowed to live ! ”
44022023	While they were screaming and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust in the air ,
44022024	the commanding officer ordered Paul to be brought back into the barracks . He told them to interrogate Paul by beating him with a lash so that he could find out the reason the crowd was shouting at Paul in this way .
44022025	When they had stretched him out for the lash , Paul said to the centurion standing nearby , “ Is it legal for you to lash a man who is a Roman citizen without a proper trial ? ”
44022026	When the centurion heard this , he went to the commanding officer and reported it , saying , “ What are you about to do ? For this man is a Roman citizen . ”
44022027	So the commanding officer came and asked Paul , “ Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? ” He replied , “ Yes . ”
44022028	The commanding officer answered , “ I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money . ” “ But I was even born a citizen , ” Paul replied .
44022029	Then those who were about to interrogate him stayed away from him , and the commanding officer was frightened when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had had him tied up .
44022030	The next day , because the commanding officer wanted to know the true reason Paul was being accused by the Jews , he released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole council to assemble . He then brought Paul down and had him stand before them .
44023001	Paul looked directly at the council and said , “ Brothers , I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God to this day . ”
44023002	At that the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , “ God is going to strike you , you whitewashed wall ! Do you sit there judging me according to the law , and in violation of the law you order me to be struck ? ”
44023004	Those standing near him said , “ Do you dare insult God’s high priest ? ”
44023005	Paul replied , “ I did not realize , brothers , that he was the high priest , for it is written , ‘ You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people . ’ ”
44023006	Then when Paul noticed that part of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees , he shouted out in the council , “ Brothers , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees . I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead ! ”
44023007	When he said this , an argument began between the Pharisees and the Sadducees , and the assembly was divided .
44023008	( For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection , or angel , or spirit , but the Pharisees acknowledge them all . )
44023009	There was a great commotion , and some experts in the law from the party of the Pharisees stood up and protested strongly , “ We find nothing wrong with this man . What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him ? ”
44023010	When the argument became so great the commanding officer feared that they would tear Paul to pieces , he ordered the detachment to go down , take him away from them by force , and bring him into the barracks .
44023011	The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said , “ Have courage , for just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem , so you must also testify in Rome . ”
44023012	When morning came , the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink anything until they had killed Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty of them who formed this conspiracy .
44023014	They went to the chief priests and the elders and said , “ We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath not to partake of anything until we have killed Paul .
44023015	So now you and the council request the commanding officer to bring him down to you , as if you were going to determine his case by conducting a more thorough inquiry . We are ready to kill him before he comes near this place . ”
44023016	But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush , he came and entered the barracks and told Paul .
44023017	Paul called one of the centurions and said , “ Take this young man to the commanding officer , for he has something to report to him . ”
44023018	So the centurion took him and brought him to the commanding officer and said , “ The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you . ”
44023019	The commanding officer took him by the hand , withdrew privately , and asked , “ What is it that you want to report to me ? ”
44023020	He replied , “ The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow , as if they were going to inquire more thoroughly about him .
44023021	So do not let them persuade you to do this , because more than forty of them are lying in ambush for him . They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him , and now they are ready , waiting for you to agree to their request . ”
44023022	Then the commanding officer sent the young man away , directing him , “ Tell no one that you have reported these things to me . ”
44023023	Then he summoned two of the centurions and said , “ Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea along with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen by nine o’clock tonight ,
44023024	and provide mounts for Paul to ride so that he may be brought safely to Felix the governor . ”
44023025	He wrote a letter that went like this :
44023031	So the soldiers , in accordance with their orders , took Paul and brought him to Antipatris during the night .
44023032	The next day they let the horsemen go on with him , and they returned to the barracks .
44023033	When the horsemen came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , they also presented Paul to him .
44023034	When the governor had read the letter , he asked what province he was from . When he learned that he was from Cilicia ,
44023035	he said , “ I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive too . ” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace .
44024001	After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney named Tertullus , and they brought formal charges against Paul to the governor .
44024002	When Paul had been summoned , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , “ We have experienced a lengthy time of peace through your rule , and reforms are being made in this nation through your foresight .
44024003	Most excellent Felix , we acknowledge this everywhere and in every way with all gratitude .
44024004	But so that I may not delay you any further , I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness .
44024005	For we have found this man to be a troublemaker , one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes .
44024006	He even tried to desecrate the temple , so we arrested him .
44024008	When you examine him yourself , you will be able to learn from him about all these things we are accusing him of doing . ”
44024009	The Jews also joined in the verbal attack , claiming that these things were true .
44024010	When the governor gestured for him to speak , Paul replied , “ Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years , I confidently make my defense .
44024011	As you can verify for yourself , not more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship .
44024012	They did not find me arguing with anyone or stirring up a crowd in the temple courts or in the synagogues or throughout the city ,
44024013	nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of doing .
44024014	But I confess this to you , that I worship the God of our ancestors according to the Way ( which they call a sect ) , believing everything that is according to the law and that is written in the prophets .
44024015	I have a hope in God ( a hope that these men themselves accept too ) that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous .
44024016	This is the reason I do my best to always have a clear conscience toward God and toward people .
44024017	After several years I came to bring to my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings ,
44024018	which I was doing when they found me in the temple , ritually purified , without a crowd or a disturbance .
44024019	But there are some Jews from the province of Asia who should be here before you and bring charges , if they have anything against me .
44024020	Or these men here should tell what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the council ,
44024021	other than this one thing I shouted out while I stood before them : ‘ I am on trial before you today concerning the resurrection of the dead . ’ ”
44024022	Then Felix , who understood the facts concerning the Way more accurately , adjourned their hearing , saying , “ When Lysias the commanding officer comes down , I will decide your case . ”
44024023	He ordered the centurion to guard Paul , but to let him have some freedom , and not to prevent any of his friends from meeting his needs .
44024024	Some days later , when Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla , who was Jewish , he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	While Paul was discussing righteousness , self-control , and the coming judgment , Felix became frightened and said , “ Go away for now , and when I have an opportunity , I will send for you . ”
44024026	At the same time he was also hoping that Paul would give him money , and for this reason he sent for Paul as often as possible and talked with him .
44024027	After two years had passed , Porcius Festus succeeded Felix , and because he wanted to do the Jews a favor , Felix left Paul in prison .
44025001	Now three days after Festus arrived in the province , he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	So the chief priests and the most prominent men of the Jews brought formal charges against Paul to him .
44025003	Requesting him to do them a favor against Paul , they urged Festus to summon him to Jerusalem , planning an ambush to kill him along the way .
44025004	Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea , and he himself intended to go there shortly .
44025005	“ So , ” he said , “ let your leaders go down there with me , and if this man has done anything wrong , they may bring charges against him . ”
44025006	After Festus had stayed not more than eight or ten days among them , he went down to Caesarea , and the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought .
44025007	When he arrived , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing many serious charges that they were not able to prove .
44025008	Paul said in his defense , “ I have committed no offense against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar . ”
44025009	But Festus , wanting to do the Jews a favor , asked Paul , “ Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried before me there on these charges ? ”
44025010	Paul replied , “ I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat , where I should be tried . I have done nothing wrong to the Jews , as you also know very well .
44025011	If then I am in the wrong and have done anything that deserves death , I am not trying to escape dying , but if not one of their charges against me is true , no one can hand me over to them . I appeal to Caesar ! ”
44025012	Then , after conferring with his council , Festus replied , “ You have appealed to Caesar ; to Caesar you will go ! ”
44025013	After several days had passed , King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus .
44025014	While they were staying there many days , Festus explained Paul’s case to the king to get his opinion , saying , “ There is a man left here as a prisoner by Felix .
44025015	When I was in Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him , asking for a sentence of condemnation against him .
44025016	I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met his accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the accusation .
44025017	So after they came back here with me , I did not postpone the case , but the next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought .
44025018	When his accusers stood up , they did not charge him with any of the evil deeds I had suspected .
44025019	Rather they had several points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a man named Jesus who was dead , whom Paul claimed to be alive .
44025020	Because I was at a loss how I could investigate these matters , I asked if he were willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges .
44025021	But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor , I ordered him to be kept under guard until I could send him to Caesar . ”
44025022	Agrippa said to Festus , “ I would also like to hear the man myself . ” “ Tomorrow , ” he replied , “ you will hear him . ”
44025023	So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience hall , along with the senior military officers and the prominent men of the city . When Festus gave the order , Paul was brought in .
44025024	Then Festus said , “ King Agrippa , and all you who are present here with us , you see this man about whom the entire Jewish populace petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here , shouting loudly that he ought not to live any longer .
44025025	But I found that he had done nothing that deserved death , and when he appealed to His Majesty the Emperor , I decided to send him .
44025026	But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him . Therefore I have brought him before you all , and especially before you , King Agrippa , so that after this preliminary hearing I may have something to write .
44025027	For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating the charges against him . ”
44026001	So Agrippa said to Paul , “ You have permission to speak for yourself . ” Then Paul held out his hand and began his defense :
44026002	“ Regarding all the things I have been accused of by the Jews , King Agrippa , I consider myself fortunate that I am about to make my defense before you today ,
44026003	because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversial issues of the Jews . Therefore I ask you to listen to me patiently .
44026004	Now all the Jews know the way I lived from my youth , spending my life from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem .
44026005	They know , because they have known me from time past , if they are willing to testify , that according to the strictest party of our religion , I lived as a Pharisee .
44026006	And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our ancestors ,
44026007	a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve God night and day . Concerning this hope the Jews are accusing me , Your Majesty !
44026008	Why do you people think it is unbelievable that God raises the dead ?
44026009	Of course , I myself was convinced that it was necessary to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus the Nazarene .
44026010	And that is what I did in Jerusalem : Not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons by the authority I received from the chief priests , but I also cast my vote against them when they were sentenced to death .
44026011	I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme . Because I was so furiously enraged at them , I went to persecute them even in foreign cities .
44026012	“ While doing this very thing , as I was going to Damascus with authority and complete power from the chief priests ,
44026013	about noon along the road , Your Majesty , I saw a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , shining everywhere around me and those traveling with me .
44026014	When we had all fallen to the ground , I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? You are hurting yourself by kicking against the goads . ’
44026015	So I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ And the Lord replied , ‘ I am Jesus whom you are persecuting .
44026016	But get up and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this reason , to designate you in advance as a servant and witness to the things you have seen and to the things in which I will appear to you .
44026017	I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles , to whom I am sending you
44026018	to open their eyes so that they turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me . ’
44026019	“ Therefore , King Agrippa , I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision ,
44026020	but I declared to those in Damascus first , and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea , and to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , performing deeds consistent with repentance .
44026021	For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple courts and were trying to kill me .
44026022	I have experienced help from God to this day , and so I stand testifying to both small and great , saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said was going to happen :
44026023	that the Christ was to suffer and be the first to rise from the dead , to proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles . ”
44026024	As Paul was saying these things in his defense , Festus exclaimed loudly , “ You have lost your mind , Paul ! Your great learning is driving you insane ! ”
44026025	But Paul replied , “ I have not lost my mind , most excellent Festus , but am speaking true and rational words .
44026026	For the king knows about these things , and I am speaking freely to him , because I cannot believe that any of these things has escaped his notice , for this was not done in a corner .
44026027	Do you believe the prophets , King Agrippa ? I know that you believe . ”
44026028	Agrippa said to Paul , “ In such a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian ? ”
44026029	Paul replied , “ I pray to God that whether in a short or a long time not only you but also all those who are listening to me today could become such as I am , except for these chains . ”
44026030	So the king got up , and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them ,
44026031	and as they were leaving they said to one another , “ This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment . ”
44026032	Agrippa said to Festus , “ This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar . ”
44027001	When it was decided we would sail to Italy , they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius .
44027002	We went on board a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to various ports along the coast of the province of Asia and put out to sea , accompanied by Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica .
44027003	The next day we put in at Sidon , and Julius , treating Paul kindly , allowed him to go to his friends so they could provide him with what he needed .
44027004	From there we put out to sea and sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us .
44027005	After we had sailed across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we put in at Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy , and he put us aboard it .
44027007	We sailed slowly for many days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus . Because the wind prevented us from going any farther , we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone .
44027008	With difficulty we sailed along the coast of Crete and came to a place called Fair Havens that was near the town of Lasea .
44027009	Since considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast was already over , Paul advised them ,
44027010	“ Men , I can see the voyage is going to end in disaster and great loss not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . ”
44027011	But the centurion was more convinced by the captain and the ship’s owner than by what Paul said .
44027012	Because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in , the majority decided to put out to sea from there . They hoped that somehow they could reach Phoenix , a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest , and spend the winter there .
44027013	When a gentle south wind sprang up , they thought they could carry out their purpose , so they weighed anchor and sailed close along the coast of Crete .
44027014	Not long after this , a hurricane-force wind called the northeaster blew down from the island .
44027015	When the ship was caught in it and could not head into the wind , we gave way to it and were driven along .
44027016	As we ran under the lee of a small island called Cauda , we were able with difficulty to get the ship’s boat under control .
44027017	After the crew had hoisted it aboard , they used supports to undergird the ship . Fearing they would run aground on the Syrtis , they lowered the sea anchor , thus letting themselves be driven along .
44027018	The next day , because we were violently battered by the storm , they began throwing the cargo overboard ,
44027019	and on the third day they threw the ship’s gear overboard with their own hands .
44027020	When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent storm continued to batter us , we finally abandoned all hope of being saved .
44027021	Since many of them had no desire to eat , Paul stood up among them and said , “ Men , you should have listened to me and not put out to sea from Crete , thus avoiding this damage and loss .
44027022	And now I advise you to keep up your courage , for there will be no loss of life among you , but only the ship will be lost .
44027023	For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve came to me
44027024	and said , ‘ Do not be afraid , Paul ! You must stand before Caesar , and God has graciously granted you the safety of all who are sailing with you . ’
44027025	Therefore keep up your courage , men , for I have faith in God that it will be just as I have been told .
44027026	But we must run aground on some island . ”
44027027	When the fourteenth night had come , while we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors suspected they were approaching some land .
44027028	They took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep ; when they had sailed a little farther they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms deep .
44027029	Because they were afraid that we would run aground on the rocky coast , they threw out four anchors from the stern and wished for day to appear .
44027030	Then when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship’s boat into the sea , pretending that they were going to put out anchors from the bow ,
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers , “ Unless these men stay with the ship , you cannot be saved . ”
44027032	Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it drift away .
44027033	As day was about to dawn , Paul urged them all to take some food , saying , “ Today is the fourteenth day you have been in suspense and have gone without food ; you have eaten nothing .
44027034	Therefore I urge you to take some food , for this is important for your survival . For not one of you will lose a hair from his head . ”
44027035	After he said this , Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all , broke it , and began to eat .
44027036	So all of them were encouraged and took food themselves .
44027037	( We were in all two hundred seventy-six persons on the ship . )
44027038	When they had eaten enough to be satisfied , they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea .
44027039	When day came , they did not recognize the land , but they noticed a bay with a beach , where they decided to run the ship aground if they could .
44027040	So they slipped the anchors and left them in the sea , at the same time loosening the linkage that bound the steering oars together . Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and steered toward the beach .
44027041	But they encountered a patch of crosscurrents and ran the ship aground ; the bow stuck fast and could not be moved , but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves .
44027042	Now the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of them would escape by swimming away .
44027043	But the centurion , wanting to save Paul’s life , prevented them from carrying out their plan . He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land ,
44027044	and the rest were to follow , some on planks and some on pieces of the ship . And in this way all were brought safely to land .
44028001	After we had safely reached shore , we learned that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The local inhabitants showed us extraordinary kindness , for they built a fire and welcomed us all because it had started to rain and was cold .
44028003	When Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire , a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand .
44028004	When the local people saw the creature hanging from Paul’s hand , they said to one another , “ No doubt this man is a murderer ! Although he has escaped from the sea , Justice herself has not allowed him to live ! ”
44028005	However , Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm .
44028006	But they were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly drop dead . So after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him , they changed their minds and said he was a god .
44028007	Now in the region around that place were fields belonging to the chief official of the island , named Publius , who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably as guests for three days .
44028008	The father of Publius lay sick in bed , suffering from fever and dysentery . Paul went in to see him and after praying , placed his hands on him and healed him .
44028009	After this had happened , many of the people on the island who were sick also came and were healed .
44028010	They also bestowed many honors , and when we were preparing to sail , they gave us all the supplies we needed .
44028011	After three months we put out to sea in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island and had the “ Heavenly Twins ” as its figurehead .
44028012	We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days .
44028013	From there we cast off and arrived at Rhegium , and after one day a south wind sprang up and on the second day we came to Puteoli .
44028014	There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them seven days . And in this way we came to Rome .
44028015	The brothers from there , when they heard about us , came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us . When he saw them , Paul thanked God and took courage .
44028016	When we entered Rome , Paul was allowed to live by himself , with the soldier who was guarding him .
44028017	After three days Paul called the local Jewish leaders together . When they had assembled , he said to them , “ Brothers , although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors , from Jerusalem I was handed over as a prisoner to the Romans .
44028018	When they had heard my case , they wanted to release me , because there was no basis for a death sentence against me .
44028019	But when the Jews objected , I was forced to appeal to Caesar – not that I had some charge to bring against my own people .
44028020	So for this reason I have asked to see you and speak with you , for I am bound with this chain because of the hope of Israel . ”
44028021	They replied , “ We have received no letters from Judea about you , nor have any of the brothers come from there and reported or said anything bad about you .
44028022	But we would like to hear from you what you think , for regarding this sect we know that people everywhere speak against it . ”
44028023	They set a day to meet with him , and they came to him where he was staying in even greater numbers . From morning until evening he explained things to them , testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus from both the law of Moses and the prophets .
44028024	Some were convinced by what he said , but others refused to believe .
44028025	So they began to leave , unable to agree among themselves , after Paul made one last statement : “ The Holy Spirit spoke rightly to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah
44028026	when he said , ‘ Go to this people and say , “ You will keep on hearing , but will never understand , and you will keep on looking , but will never perceive .
44028027	For the heart of this people has become dull , and their ears are hard of hearing , and they have closed their eyes , so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn , and I would heal them . ” ’
44028028	“ Therefore be advised that this salvation from God has been sent to the Gentiles ; they will listen ! ”
44028030	Paul lived there two whole years in his own rented quarters and welcomed all who came to him ,
44028031	proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with complete boldness and without restriction .
45001001	From Paul , a slave of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle , set apart for the gospel of God .
45001002	This gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures ,
45001003	concerning his Son who was a descendant of David with reference to the flesh ,
45001004	who was appointed the Son-of-God-in-power according to the Holy Spirit by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord .
45001005	Through him we have received grace and our apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles on behalf of his name .
45001006	You also are among them , called to belong to Jesus Christ .
45001007	To all those loved by God in Rome , called to be saints : Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
45001008	First of all , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world .
45001009	For God , whom I serve in my spirit by preaching the gospel of his Son , is my witness that I continually remember you
45001010	and I always ask in my prayers , if perhaps now at last I may succeed in visiting you according to the will of God .
45001011	For I long to see you , so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you ,
45001012	that is , that we may be mutually comforted by one another’s faith , both yours and mine .
45001013	I do not want you to be unaware , brothers and sisters , that I often intended to come to you ( and was prevented until now ) , so that I may have some fruit even among you , just as I already have among the rest of the Gentiles .
45001014	I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians , both to the wise and to the foolish .
45001015	Thus I am eager also to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel , for it is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
45001017	For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel from faith to faith , just as it is written , “ The righteous by faith will live . ”
45001018	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness ,
45001019	because what can be known about God is plain to them , because God has made it plain to them .
45001020	For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen , because they are understood through what has been made . So people are without excuse .
45001021	For although they knew God , they did not glorify him as God or give him thanks , but they became futile in their thoughts and their senseless hearts were darkened .
45001022	Although they claimed to be wise , they became fools
45001023	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image resembling mortal human beings or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles .
45001024	Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity , to dishonor their bodies among themselves .
45001025	They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever ! Amen .
45001026	For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions . For their women exchanged the natural sexual relations for unnatural ones ,
45001027	and likewise the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed in their passions for one another . Men committed shameless acts with men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error .
45001028	And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God , God gave them over to a depraved mind , to do what should not be done .
45001029	They are filled with every kind of unrighteousness , wickedness , covetousness , malice . They are rife with envy , murder , strife , deceit , hostility . They are gossips ,
45001030	slanderers , haters of God , insolent , arrogant , boastful , contrivers of all sorts of evil , disobedient to parents ,
45001031	senseless , covenant-breakers , heartless , ruthless .
45001032	Although they fully know God’s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die , they not only do them but also approve of those who practice them .
45002001	Therefore you are without excuse , whoever you are , when you judge someone else . For on whatever grounds you judge another , you condemn yourself , because you who judge practice the same things .
45002002	Now we know that God’s judgment is in accordance with truth against those who practice such things .
45002003	And do you think , whoever you are , when you judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself , that you will escape God’s judgment ?
45002004	Or do you have contempt for the wealth of his kindness , forbearance , and patience , and yet do not know that God’s kindness leads you to repentance ?
45002005	But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart , you are storing up wrath for yourselves in the day of wrath , when God’s righteous judgment is revealed !
45002006	He will reward each one according to his works :
45002007	eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works seek glory and honor and immortality ,
45002008	but wrath and anger to those who live in selfish ambition and do not obey the truth but follow unrighteousness .
45002009	There will be affliction and distress on everyone who does evil , on the Jew first and also the Greek ,
45002010	but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good , for the Jew first and also the Greek .
45002011	For there is no partiality with God .
45002012	For all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law , and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
45002013	For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous before God , but those who do the law will be declared righteous .
45002014	For whenever the Gentiles , who do not have the law , do by nature the things required by the law , these who do not have the law are a law to themselves .
45002015	They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts , as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them ,
45002016	on the day when God will judge the secrets of human hearts , according to my gospel through Christ Jesus .
45002017	But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of your relationship to God
45002018	and know his will and approve the superior things because you receive instruction from the law ,
45002019	and if you are convinced that you yourself are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
45002020	an educator of the senseless , a teacher of little children , because you have in the law the essential features of knowledge and of the truth –
45002021	therefore you who teach someone else , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , do you steal ?
45002022	You who tell others not to commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who boast in the law dishonor God by transgressing the law !
45002024	For just as it is written , “ the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you . ”
45002025	For circumcision has its value if you practice the law , but if you break the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
45002026	Therefore if the uncircumcised man obeys the righteous requirements of the law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision ?
45002027	And will not the physically uncircumcised man who keeps the law judge you who , despite the written code and circumcision , transgress the law ?
45002028	For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly , nor is circumcision something that is outward in the flesh ,
45002029	but someone is a Jew who is one inwardly , and circumcision is of the heart by the Spirit and not by the written code . This person’s praise is not from people but from God .
45003001	Therefore what advantage does the Jew have , or what is the value of circumcision ?
45003002	Actually , there are many advantages . First of all , the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God .
45003003	What then ? If some did not believe , does their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God ?
45003004	Absolutely not ! Let God be proven true , and every human being shown up as a liar , just as it is written : “ so that you will be justified in your words and will prevail when you are judged . ”
45003005	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous , is he ? ( I am speaking in human terms . )
45003006	Absolutely not ! For otherwise how could God judge the world ?
45003007	For if by my lie the truth of God enhances his glory , why am I still actually being judged as a sinner ?
45003008	And why not say , “ Let us do evil so that good may come of it ” ? – as some who slander us allege that we say . ( Their condemnation is deserved ! )
45003009	What then ? Are we better off ? Certainly not , for we have already charged that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin ,
45003010	just as it is written : “ There is no one righteous , not even one ,
45003011	there is no one who understands , there is no one who seeks God .
45003012	All have turned away , together they have become worthless ; there is no one who shows kindness , not even one . ”
45003013	“ Their throats are open graves , they deceive with their tongues , the poison of asps is under their lips . ”
45003014	“ Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness . ”
45003015	“ Their feet are swift to shed blood ,
45003016	ruin and misery are in their paths ,
45003017	and the way of peace they have not known . ”
45003018	“ There is no fear of God before their eyes . ”
45003019	Now we know that whatever the law says , it says to those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be held accountable to God .
45003020	For no one is declared righteous before him by the works of the law , for through the law comes the knowledge of sin .
45003021	But now apart from the law the righteousness of God ( which is attested by the law and the prophets ) has been disclosed –
45003022	namely , the righteousness of God through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe . For there is no distinction ,
45003023	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God .
45003024	But they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus .
45003025	God publicly displayed him at his death as the mercy seat accessible through faith . This was to demonstrate his righteousness , because God in his forbearance had passed over the sins previously committed .
45003026	This was also to demonstrate his righteousness in the present time , so that he would be just and the justifier of the one who lives because of Jesus’ faithfulness .
45003027	Where , then , is boasting ? It is excluded ! By what principle ? Of works ? No , but by the principle of faith !
45003028	For we consider that a person is declared righteous by faith apart from the works of the law .
45003029	Or is God the God of the Jews only ? Is he not the God of the Gentiles too ? Yes , of the Gentiles too !
45003030	Since God is one , he will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith .
45003031	Do we then nullify the law through faith ? Absolutely not ! Instead we uphold the law .
45004001	What then shall we say that Abraham , our ancestor according to the flesh , has discovered regarding this matter ?
45004002	For if Abraham was declared righteous by the works of the law , he has something to boast about – but not before God .
45004003	For what does the scripture say ? “ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . ”
45004004	Now to the one who works , his pay is not credited due to grace but due to obligation .
45004005	But to the one who does not work , but believes in the one who declares the ungodly righteous , his faith is credited as righteousness .
45004006	So even David himself speaks regarding the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
45004007	“ Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven , and whose sins are covered ;
45004008	blessed is the one against whom the Lord will never count sin . ”
45004009	Is this blessedness then for the circumcision or also for the uncircumcision ? For we say , “ faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness . ”
45004010	How then was it credited to him ? Was he circumcised at the time , or not ? No , he was not circumcised but uncircumcised !
45004011	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised , so that he would become the father of all those who believe but have never been circumcised , that they too could have righteousness credited to them .
45004012	And he is also the father of the circumcised , who are not only circumcised , but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham possessed when he was still uncircumcised .
45004013	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would inherit the world was not fulfilled through the law , but through the righteousness that comes by faith .
45004014	For if they become heirs by the law , faith is empty and the promise is nullified .
45004015	For the law brings wrath , because where there is no law there is no transgression either .
45004016	For this reason it is by faith so that it may be by grace , with the result that the promise may be certain to all the descendants – not only to those who are under the law , but also to those who have the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all
45004017	( as it is written , “ I have made you the father of many nations ” ) . He is our father in the presence of God whom he believed – the God who makes the dead alive and summons the things that do not yet exist as though they already do .
45004018	Against hope Abraham believed in hope with the result that he became the father of many nations according to the pronouncement , “ so will your descendants be . ”
45004019	Without being weak in faith , he considered his own body as dead ( because he was about one hundred years old ) and the deadness of Sarah’s womb .
45004020	He did not waver in unbelief about the promise of God but was strengthened in faith , giving glory to God .
45004021	He was fully convinced that what God promised he was also able to do .
45004022	So indeed it was credited to Abraham as righteousness .
45004023	But the statement it was credited to him was not written only for Abraham’s sake ,
45004024	but also for our sake , to whom it will be credited , those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
45004025	He was given over because of our transgressions and was raised for the sake of our justification .
45005001	Therefore , since we have been declared righteous by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
45005002	through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand , and we rejoice in the hope of God’s glory .
45005003	Not only this , but we also rejoice in sufferings , knowing that suffering produces endurance ,
45005004	and endurance , character , and character , hope .
45005005	And hope does not disappoint , because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
45005006	For while we were still helpless , at the right time Christ died for the ungodly .
45005007	( For rarely will anyone die for a righteous person , though for a good person perhaps someone might possibly dare to die . )
45005008	But God demonstrates his own love for us , in that while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
45005009	Much more then , because we have now been declared righteous by his blood , we will be saved through him from God’s wrath .
45005010	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , how much more , since we have been reconciled , will we be saved by his life ?
45005011	Not only this , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received this reconciliation .
45005012	So then , just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin , and so death spread to all people because all sinned –
45005013	for before the law was given , sin was in the world , but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law .
45005014	Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam ( who is a type of the coming one ) transgressed .
45005015	But the gracious gift is not like the transgression . For if the many died through the transgression of the one man , how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ multiply to the many !
45005016	And the gift is not like the one who sinned . For judgment , resulting from the one transgression , led to condemnation , but the gracious gift from the many failures led to justification .
45005017	For if , by the transgression of the one man , death reigned through the one , how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one , Jesus Christ !
45005018	Consequently , just as condemnation for all people came through one transgression , so too through the one righteous act came righteousness leading to life for all people .
45005019	For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous .
45005020	Now the law came in so that the transgression may increase , but where sin increased , grace multiplied all the more ,
45005021	so that just as sin reigned in death , so also grace will reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	What shall we say then ? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase ?
45006002	Absolutely not ! How can we who died to sin still live in it ?
45006003	Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
45006004	Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death , in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we too may live a new life .
45006005	For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death , we will certainly also be united in the likeness of his resurrection .
45006006	We know that our old man was crucified with him so that the body of sin would no longer dominate us , so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin .
45006007	( For someone who has died has been freed from sin . )
45006008	Now if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
45006009	We know that since Christ has been raised from the dead , he is never going to die again ; death no longer has mastery over him .
45006010	For the death he died , he died to sin once for all , but the life he lives , he lives to God .
45006011	So you too consider yourselves dead to sin , but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires ,
45006013	and do not present your members to sin as instruments to be used for unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments to be used for righteousness .
45006014	For sin will have no mastery over you , because you are not under law but under grace .
45006015	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? Absolutely not !
45006016	Do you not know that if you present yourselves as obedient slaves , you are slaves of the one you obey , either of sin resulting in death , or obedience resulting in righteousness ?
45006017	But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin , you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to ,
45006018	and having been freed from sin , you became enslaved to righteousness .
45006019	( I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . ) For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness leading to more lawlessness , so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification .
45006020	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free with regard to righteousness .
45006021	So what benefit did you then reap from those things that you are now ashamed of ? For the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now , freed from sin and enslaved to God , you have your benefit leading to sanctification , and the end is eternal life .
45006023	For the payoff of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Or do you not know , brothers and sisters ( for I am speaking to those who know the law ) , that the law is lord over a person as long as he lives ?
45007002	For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives , but if her husband dies , she is released from the law of the marriage .
45007003	So then , if she is joined to another man while her husband is alive , she will be called an adulteress . But if her husband dies , she is free from that law , and if she is joined to another man , she is not an adulteress .
45007004	So , my brothers and sisters , you also died to the law through the body of Christ , so that you could be joined to another , to the one who was raised from the dead , to bear fruit to God .
45007005	For when we were in the flesh , the sinful desires , aroused by the law , were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death .
45007006	But now we have been released from the law , because we have died to what controlled us , so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit and not under the old written code .
45007007	What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? Absolutely not ! Certainly , I would not have known sin except through the law . For indeed I would not have known what it means to desire something belonging to someone else if the law had not said , “ Do not covet . ”
45007008	But sin , seizing the opportunity through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of wrong desires . For apart from the law , sin is dead .
45007009	And I was once alive apart from the law , but with the coming of the commandment sin became alive
45007010	and I died . So I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life brought death !
45007011	For sin , seizing the opportunity through the commandment , deceived me and through it I died .
45007012	So then , the law is holy , and the commandment is holy , righteous , and good .
45007013	Did that which is good , then , become death to me ? Absolutely not ! But sin , so that it would be shown to be sin , produced death in me through what is good , so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful .
45007014	For we know that the law is spiritual – but I am unspiritual , sold into slavery to sin .
45007015	For I don’t understand what I am doing . For I do not do what I want – instead , I do what I hate .
45007016	But if I do what I don’t want , I agree that the law is good .
45007017	But now it is no longer me doing it , but sin that lives in me .
45007018	For I know that nothing good lives in me , that is , in my flesh . For I want to do the good , but I cannot do it .
45007019	For I do not do the good I want , but I do the very evil I do not want !
45007020	Now if I do what I do not want , it is no longer me doing it but sin that lives in me .
45007021	So , I find the law that when I want to do good , evil is present with me .
45007022	For I delight in the law of God in my inner being .
45007023	But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members .
45007024	Wretched man that I am ! Who will rescue me from this body of death ?
45007025	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I myself serve the law of God with my mind , but with my flesh I serve the law of sin .
45008001	There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus .
45008002	For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death .
45008003	For God achieved what the law could not do because it was weakened through the flesh . By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ,
45008004	so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us , who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
45008005	For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit .
45008006	For the outlook of the flesh is death , but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace ,
45008007	because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God , for it does not submit to the law of God , nor is it able to do so .
45008008	Those who are in the flesh cannot please God .
45008009	You , however , are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you . Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , this person does not belong to him .
45008010	But if Christ is in you , your body is dead because of sin , but the Spirit is your life because of righteousness .
45008011	Moreover if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you , the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his Spirit who lives in you .
45008012	So then , brothers and sisters , we are under obligation , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh
45008013	( for if you live according to the flesh , you will die ) , but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live .
45008014	For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God .
45008015	For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear , but you received the Spirit of adoption , by whom we cry , “ Abba , Father . ”
45008016	The Spirit himself bears witness to our spirit that we are God’s children .
45008017	And if children , then heirs ( namely , heirs of God and also fellow heirs with Christ ) – if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him .
45008018	For I consider that our present sufferings cannot even be compared to the glory that will be revealed to us .
45008019	For the creation eagerly waits for the revelation of the sons of God .
45008020	For the creation was subjected to futility – not willingly but because of God who subjected it – in hope
45008021	that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage of decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children .
45008022	For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers together until now .
45008023	Not only this , but we ourselves also , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption , the redemption of our bodies .
45008024	For in hope we were saved . Now hope that is seen is not hope , because who hopes for what he sees ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we do not see , we eagerly wait for it with endurance .
45008026	In the same way , the Spirit helps us in our weakness , for we do not know how we should pray , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings .
45008027	And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes on behalf of the saints according to God’s will .
45008028	And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , who are called according to his purpose ,
45008029	because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters .
45008030	And those he predestined , he also called ; and those he called , he also justified ; and those he justified , he also glorified .
45008031	What then shall we say about these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	Indeed , he who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all – how will he not also , along with him , freely give us all things ?
45008033	Who will bring any charge against God’s elect ? It is God who justifies .
45008034	Who is the one who will condemn ? Christ is the one who died ( and more than that , he was raised ) , who is at the right hand of God , and who also is interceding for us .
45008035	Who will separate us from the love of Christ ? Will trouble , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
45008036	As it is written , “ For your sake we encounter death all day long ; we were considered as sheep to be slaughtered . ”
45008037	No , in all these things we have complete victory through him who loved us !
45008038	For I am convinced that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor heavenly rulers , nor things that are present , nor things to come , nor powers ,
45008039	nor height , nor depth , nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I am telling the truth in Christ ( I am not lying ! ) , for my conscience assures me in the Holy Spirit –
45009002	I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart .
45009003	For I could wish that I myself were accursed – cut off from Christ – for the sake of my people , my fellow countrymen ,
45009004	who are Israelites . To them belong the adoption as sons , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the temple worship , and the promises .
45009005	To them belong the patriarchs , and from them , by human descent , came the Christ , who is God over all , blessed forever ! Amen .
45009006	It is not as though the word of God had failed . For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel ,
45009007	nor are all the children Abraham’s true descendants ; rather “ through Isaac will your descendants be counted . ”
45009008	This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God ; rather , the children of promise are counted as descendants .
45009009	For this is what the promise declared : “ About a year from now I will return and Sarah will have a son . ”
45009010	Not only that , but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man , our ancestor Isaac –
45009011	even before they were born or had done anything good or bad ( so that God’s purpose in election would stand , not by works but by his calling ) –
45009012	it was said to her , “ The older will serve the younger , ”
45009013	just as it is written : “ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . ”
45009014	What shall we say then ? Is there injustice with God ? Absolutely not !
45009015	For he says to Moses : “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . ”
45009016	So then , it does not depend on human desire or exertion , but on God who shows mercy .
45009017	For the scripture says to Pharaoh : “ For this very purpose I have raised you up , that I may demonstrate my power in you , and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth . ”
45009018	So then , God has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy , and he hardens whom he chooses to harden .
45009019	You will say to me then , “ Why does he still find fault ? For who has ever resisted his will ? ”
45009020	But who indeed are you – a mere human being – to talk back to God ? Does what is molded say to the molder , “ Why have you made me like this ? ”
45009021	Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special use and another for ordinary use ?
45009022	But what if God , willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power , has endured with much patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction ?
45009023	And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects of mercy that he has prepared beforehand for glory –
45009024	even us , whom he has called , not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles ?
45009025	As he also says in Hosea : “ I will call those who were not my people , ‘ My people , ’ and I will call her who was unloved , ‘ My beloved . ’ ”
45009026	“ And in the very place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they will be called ‘ sons of the living God . ’ ”
45009027	And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel , “ Though the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea , only the remnant will be saved ,
45009028	for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and quickly . ”
45009029	Just as Isaiah predicted , “ If the Lord of armies had not left us descendants , we would have become like Sodom , and we would have resembled Gomorrah . ”
45009030	What shall we say then ? – that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it , that is , a righteousness that is by faith ,
45009031	but Israel even though pursuing a law of righteousness did not attain it .
45009032	Why not ? Because they pursued it not by faith but ( as if it were possible ) by works . They stumbled over the stumbling stone ,
45009033	just as it is written , “ Look , I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble and a rock that will make them fall , yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame . ”
45010001	Brothers and sisters , my heart’s desire and prayer to God on behalf of my fellow Israelites is for their salvation .
45010002	For I can testify that they are zealous for God , but their zeal is not in line with the truth .
45010003	For ignoring the righteousness that comes from God , and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness , they did not submit to God’s righteousness .
45010004	For Christ is the end of the law , with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes .
45010005	For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law : “ The one who does these things will live by them . ”
45010006	But the righteousness that is by faith says : “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ” ( that is , to bring Christ down )
45010007	or “ Who will descend into the abyss ? ” ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
45010008	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” ( that is , the word of faith that we preach ) ,
45010009	because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness and with the mouth one confesses and thus has salvation .
45010011	For the scripture says , “ Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame . ”
45010012	For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek , for the same Lord is Lord of all , who richly blesses all who call on him .
45010013	For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved .
45010014	How are they to call on one they have not believed in ? And how are they to believe in one they have not heard of ? And how are they to hear without someone preaching to them ?
45010015	And how are they to preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , “ How timely is the arrival of those who proclaim the good news . ”
45010016	But not all have obeyed the good news , for Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed our report ? ”
45010017	Consequently faith comes from what is heard , and what is heard comes through the preached word of Christ .
45010018	But I ask , have they not heard ? Yes , they have : Their voice has gone out to all the earth , and their words to the ends of the world .
45010019	But again I ask , didn’t Israel understand ? First Moses says , “ I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation ; with a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger . ”
45010020	And Isaiah is even bold enough to say , “ I was found by those who did not seek me ; I became well known to those who did not ask for me . ”
45010021	But about Israel he says , “ All day long I held out my hands to this disobedient and stubborn people ! ”
45011001	So I ask , God has not rejected his people , has he ? Absolutely not ! For I too am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , from the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew ! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
45011003	“ Lord , they have killed your prophets , they have demolished your altars ; I alone am left and they are seeking my life ! ”
45011004	But what was the divine response to him ? “ I have kept for myself seven thousand people who have not bent the knee to Baal . ”
45011005	So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace .
45011006	And if it is by grace , it is no longer by works , otherwise grace would no longer be grace .
45011007	What then ? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking , but the elect obtained it . The rest were hardened ,
45011008	as it is written , “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear , to this very day . ”
45011009	And David says , “ Let their table become a snare and trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them ;
45011010	let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see , and make their backs bend continually . ”
45011011	I ask then , they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall , did they ? Absolutely not ! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles , to make Israel jealous .
45011012	Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their full restoration bring ?
45011013	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles . Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I magnify my ministry ,
45011014	if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them .
45011015	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
45011016	If the first portion of the dough offered is holy , then the whole batch is holy , and if the root is holy , so too are the branches .
45011017	Now if some of the branches were broken off , and you , a wild olive shoot , were grafted in among them and participated in the richness of the olive root ,
45011018	do not boast over the branches . But if you boast , remember that you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
45011019	Then you will say , “ The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in . ”
45011020	Granted ! They were broken off because of their unbelief , but you stand by faith . Do not be arrogant , but fear !
45011021	For if God did not spare the natural branches , perhaps he will not spare you .
45011022	Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God – harshness toward those who have fallen , but God’s kindness toward you , provided you continue in his kindness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
45011023	And even they – if they do not continue in their unbelief – will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and grafted , contrary to nature , into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree ?
45011025	For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery , brothers and sisters , so that you may not be conceited : A partial hardening has happened to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in .
45011026	And so all Israel will be saved , as it is written : “ The Deliverer will come out of Zion ; he will remove ungodliness from Jacob .
45011027	And this is my covenant with them , when I take away their sins . ”
45011028	In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake , but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers .
45011029	For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable .
45011030	Just as you were formerly disobedient to God , but have now received mercy due to their disobedience ,
45011031	so they too have now been disobedient in order that , by the mercy shown to you , they too may now receive mercy .
45011032	For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all .
45011033	Oh , the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments and how fathomless his ways !
45011034	For who has known the mind of the Lord , or who has been his counselor ?
45011035	Or who has first given to God , that God needs to repay him ?
45011036	For from him and through him and to him are all things . To him be glory forever ! Amen .
45012001	Therefore I exhort you , brothers and sisters , by the mercies of God , to present your bodies as a sacrifice – alive , holy , and pleasing to God – which is your reasonable service .
45012002	Do not be conformed to this present world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind , so that you may test and approve what is the will of God – what is good and well-pleasing and perfect .
45012003	For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think , but to think with sober discernment , as God has distributed to each of you a measure of faith .
45012004	For just as in one body we have many members , and not all the members serve the same function ,
45012005	so we who are many are one body in Christ , and individually we are members who belong to one another .
45012006	And we have different gifts according to the grace given to us . If the gift is prophecy , that individual must use it in proportion to his faith .
45012007	If it is service , he must serve ; if it is teaching , he must teach ;
45012008	if it is exhortation , he must exhort ; if it is contributing , he must do so with sincerity ; if it is leadership , he must do so with diligence ; if it is showing mercy , he must do so with cheerfulness .
45012009	Love must be without hypocrisy . Abhor what is evil , cling to what is good .
45012010	Be devoted to one another with mutual love , showing eagerness in honoring one another .
45012011	Do not lag in zeal , be enthusiastic in spirit , serve the Lord .
45012012	Rejoice in hope , endure in suffering , persist in prayer .
45012013	Contribute to the needs of the saints , pursue hospitality .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you , bless and do not curse .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep .
45012016	Live in harmony with one another ; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly . Do not be conceited .
45012017	Do not repay anyone evil for evil ; consider what is good before all people .
45012018	If possible , so far as it depends on you , live peaceably with all people .
45012019	Do not avenge yourselves , dear friends , but give place to God’s wrath , for it is written , “ Vengeance is mine , I will repay , ” says the Lord .
45012020	Rather , if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head .
45012021	Do not be overcome by evil , but overcome evil with good .
45013001	Let every person be subject to the governing authorities . For there is no authority except by God’s appointment , and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God .
45013002	So the person who resists such authority resists the ordinance of God , and those who resist will incur judgment
45013003	( for rulers cause no fear for good conduct but for bad ) . Do you desire not to fear authority ? Do good and you will receive its commendation ,
45013004	for it is God’s servant for your good . But if you do wrong , be in fear , for it does not bear the sword in vain . It is God’s servant to administer retribution on the wrongdoer .
45013005	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection , not only because of the wrath of the authorities but also because of your conscience .
45013006	For this reason you also pay taxes , for the authorities are God’s servants devoted to governing .
45013007	Pay everyone what is owed : taxes to whom taxes are due , revenue to whom revenue is due , respect to whom respect is due , honor to whom honor is due .
45013008	Owe no one anything , except to love one another , for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law .
45013009	For the commandments , “ Do not commit adultery , do not murder , do not steal , do not covet , ” ( and if there is any other commandment ) are summed up in this , “ Love your neighbor as yourself . ”
45013010	Love does no wrong to a neighbor . Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law .
45013011	And do this because we know the time , that it is already the hour for us to awake from sleep , for our salvation is now nearer than when we became believers .
45013012	The night has advanced toward dawn ; the day is near . So then we must lay aside the works of darkness , and put on the weapons of light .
45013013	Let us live decently as in the daytime , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and sensuality , not in discord and jealousy .
45013014	Instead , put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh to arouse its desires .
45014001	Now receive the one who is weak in the faith , and do not have disputes over differing opinions .
45014002	One person believes in eating everything , but the weak person eats only vegetables .
45014003	The one who eats everything must not despise the one who does not , and the one who abstains must not judge the one who eats everything , for God has accepted him .
45014004	Who are you to pass judgment on another’s servant ? Before his own master he stands or falls . And he will stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
45014005	One person regards one day holier than other days , and another regards them all alike . Each must be fully convinced in his own mind .
45014006	The one who observes the day does it for the Lord . The one who eats , eats for the Lord because he gives thanks to God , and the one who abstains from eating abstains for the Lord , and he gives thanks to God .
45014007	For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself .
45014008	If we live , we live for the Lord ; if we die , we die for the Lord . Therefore , whether we live or die , we are the Lord’s .
45014009	For this reason Christ died and returned to life , so that he may be the Lord of both the dead and the living .
45014010	But you who eat vegetables only – why do you judge your brother or sister ? And you who eat everything – why do you despise your brother or sister ? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God .
45014011	For it is written , “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee will bow to me , and every tongue will give praise to God . ”
45014012	Therefore , each of us will give an account of himself to God .
45014013	Therefore we must not pass judgment on one another , but rather determine never to place an obstacle or a trap before a brother or sister .
45014014	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean in itself ; still , it is unclean to the one who considers it unclean .
45014015	For if your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat , you are no longer walking in love . Do not destroy by your food someone for whom Christ died .
45014016	Therefore do not let what you consider good be spoken of as evil .
45014017	For the kingdom of God does not consist of food and drink , but righteousness , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	For the one who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people .
45014019	So then , let us pursue what makes for peace and for building up one another .
45014020	Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food . For although all things are clean , it is wrong to cause anyone to stumble by what you eat .
45014021	It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything that causes your brother to stumble .
45014022	The faith you have , keep to yourself before God . Blessed is the one who does not judge himself by what he approves .
45014023	But the man who doubts is condemned if he eats , because he does not do so from faith , and whatever is not from faith is sin .
45015001	But we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak , and not just please ourselves .
45015002	Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up .
45015003	For even Christ did not please himself , but just as it is written , “ The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me . ”
45015004	For everything that was written in former times was written for our instruction , so that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope .
45015005	Now may the God of endurance and comfort give you unity with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus ,
45015006	so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Receive one another , then , just as Christ also received you , to God’s glory .
45015008	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth to confirm the promises made to the fathers ,
45015009	and thus the Gentiles glorify God for his mercy . As it is written , “ Because of this I will confess you among the Gentiles , and I will sing praises to your name . ”
45015010	And again it says : “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , with his people . ”
45015011	And again , “ Praise the Lord all you Gentiles , and let all the peoples praise him . ”
45015012	And again Isaiah says , “ The root of Jesse will come , and the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles , in him will the Gentiles hope . ”
45015013	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in him , so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	But I myself am fully convinced about you , my brothers and sisters , that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , and able to instruct one another .
45015015	But I have written more boldly to you on some points so as to remind you , because of the grace given to me by God
45015016	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . I serve the gospel of God like a priest , so that the Gentiles may become an acceptable offering , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	So I boast in Christ Jesus about the things that pertain to God .
45015018	For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in order to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles , by word and deed ,
45015019	in the power of signs and wonders , in the power of the Spirit of God . So from Jerusalem even as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
45015020	And in this way I desire to preach where Christ has not been named , so as not to build on another person’s foundation ,
45015021	but as it is written : “ Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard will understand . ”
45015022	This is the reason I was often hindered from coming to you .
45015023	But now there is nothing more to keep me in these regions , and I have for many years desired to come to you
45015024	when I go to Spain . For I hope to visit you when I pass through and that you will help me on my journey there , after I have enjoyed your company for a while .
45015025	But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints .
45015026	For Macedonia and Achaia are pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem .
45015027	For they were pleased to do this , and indeed they are indebted to the Jerusalem saints . For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things , they are obligated also to minister to them in material things .
45015028	Therefore after I have completed this and have safely delivered this bounty to them , I will set out for Spain by way of you ,
45015029	and I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of Christ’s blessing .
45015030	Now I urge you , brothers and sisters , through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit , to join fervently with me in prayer to God on my behalf .
45015031	Pray that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea and that my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ,
45015032	so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company .
45015033	Now may the God of peace be with all of you . Amen .
45016001	Now I commend to you our sister Phoebe , who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea ,
45016002	so that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and provide her with whatever help she may need from you , for she has been a great help to many , including me .
45016003	Greet Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	who risked their own necks for my life . Not only I , but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them .
45016005	Also greet the church in their house . Greet my dear friend Epenetus , who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia .
45016006	Greet Mary , who has worked very hard for you .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junia , my compatriots and my fellow prisoners . They are well known to the apostles , and they were in Christ before me .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus , my dear friend in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and my good friend Stachys .
45016010	Greet Apelles , who is approved in Christ . Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet Herodion , my compatriot . Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord .
45016012	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa , laborers in the Lord . Greet my dear friend Persis , who has worked hard in the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , chosen in the Lord , and his mother who was also a mother to me .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers and sisters with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the believers who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ greet you .
45016017	Now I urge you , brothers and sisters , to watch out for those who create dissensions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned . Avoid them !
45016018	For these are the kind who do not serve our Lord Christ , but their own appetites . By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of the naive .
45016019	Your obedience is known to all and thus I rejoice over you . But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil .
45016020	The God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , greets you ; so do Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater , my compatriots .
45016022	I , Tertius , who am writing this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , who is host to me and to the whole church , greets you . Erastus the city treasurer and our brother Quartus greet you .
45016025	Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery that had been kept secret for long ages ,
45016026	but now is disclosed , and through the prophetic scriptures has been made known to all the nations , according to the command of the eternal God , to bring about the obedience of faith –
45016027	to the only wise God , through Jesus Christ , be glory forever ! Amen .
46001001	From Paul , called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Sosthenes , our brother ,
46001002	to the church of God that is in Corinth , to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus , and called to be saints , with all those in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours .
46001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
46001004	I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus .
46001005	For you were made rich in every way in him , in all your speech and in every kind of knowledge –
46001006	just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you –
46001007	so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001008	He will also strengthen you to the end , so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful , by whom you were called into fellowship with his son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	I urge you , brothers and sisters , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to agree together , to end your divisions , and to be united by the same mind and purpose .
46001011	For members of Chloe’s household have made it clear to me , my brothers and sisters , that there are quarrels among you .
46001012	Now I mean this , that each of you is saying , “ I am with Paul , ” or “ I am with Apollos , ” or “ I am with Cephas , ” or “ I am with Christ . ”
46001013	Is Christ divided ? Paul wasn’t crucified for you , was he ? Or were you in fact baptized in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name !
46001016	( I also baptized the household of Stephanus . Otherwise , I do not remember whether I baptized anyone else . )
46001017	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the gospel – and not with clever speech , so that the cross of Christ would not become useless .
46001018	For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
46001019	For it is written , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and I will thwart the cleverness of the intelligent . ”
46001020	Where is the wise man ? Where is the expert in the Mosaic law ? Where is the debater of this age ? Has God not made the wisdom of the world foolish ?
46001021	For since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not know God , God was pleased to save those who believe by the foolishness of preaching .
46001022	For Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks ask for wisdom ,
46001023	but we preach about a crucified Christ , a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles .
46001024	But to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
46001026	Think about the circumstances of your call , brothers and sisters . Not many were wise by human standards , not many were powerful , not many were born to a privileged position .
46001027	But God chose what the world thinks foolish to shame the wise , and God chose what the world thinks weak to shame the strong .
46001028	God chose what is low and despised in the world , what is regarded as nothing , to set aside what is regarded as something ,
46001029	so that no one can boast in his presence .
46001030	He is the reason you have a relationship with Christ Jesus , who became for us wisdom from God , and righteousness and sanctification and redemption ,
46001031	so that , as it is written , “ Let the one who boasts , boast in the Lord . ”
46002001	When I came to you , brothers and sisters , I did not come with superior eloquence or wisdom as I proclaimed the testimony of God .
46002002	For I decided to be concerned about nothing among you except Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
46002003	And I was with you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling .
46002004	My conversation and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom , but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power ,
46002005	so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on the power of God .
46002006	Now we do speak wisdom among the mature , but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age , who are perishing .
46002007	Instead we speak the wisdom of God , hidden in a mystery , that God determined before the ages for our glory .
46002008	None of the rulers of this age understood it . If they had known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But just as it is written , “ Things that no eye has seen , or ear heard , or mind imagined , are the things God has prepared for those who love him . ”
46002010	God has revealed these to us by the Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , even the deep things of God .
46002011	For who among men knows the things of a man except the man’s spirit within him ? So too , no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God .
46002012	Now we have not received the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God .
46002013	And we speak about these things , not with words taught us by human wisdom , but with those taught by the Spirit , explaining spiritual things to spiritual people .
46002014	The unbeliever does not receive the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him . And he cannot understand them , because they are spiritually discerned .
46002015	The one who is spiritual discerns all things , yet he himself is understood by no one .
46002016	For who has known the mind of the Lord , so as to advise him ? But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	So , brothers and sisters , I could not speak to you as spiritual people , but instead as people of the flesh , as infants in Christ .
46003002	I fed you milk , not solid food , for you were not yet ready . In fact , you are still not ready ,
46003003	for you are still influenced by the flesh . For since there is still jealousy and dissension among you , are you not influenced by the flesh and behaving like unregenerate people ?
46003004	For whenever someone says , “ I am with Paul , ” or “ I am with Apollos , ” are you not merely human ?
46003005	What is Apollos , really ? Or what is Paul ? Servants through whom you came to believe , and each of us in the ministry the Lord gave us .
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God caused it to grow .
46003007	So neither the one who plants counts for anything , nor the one who waters , but God who causes the growth .
46003008	The one who plants and the one who waters work as one , but each will receive his reward according to his work .
46003009	We are coworkers belonging to God . You are God’s field , God’s building .
46003010	According to the grace of God given to me , like a skilled master-builder I laid a foundation , but someone else builds on it . And each one must be careful how he builds .
46003011	For no one can lay any foundation other than what is being laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	If anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , or straw ,
46003013	each builder’s work will be plainly seen , for the Day will make it clear , because it will be revealed by fire . And the fire will test what kind of work each has done .
46003014	If what someone has built survives , he will receive a reward .
46003015	If someone’s work is burned up , he will suffer loss . He himself will be saved , but only as through fire .
46003016	Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you ?
46003017	If someone destroys God’s temple , God will destroy him . For God’s temple is holy , which is what you are .
46003018	Guard against self-deception , each of you . If someone among you thinks he is wise in this age , let him become foolish so that he can become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God . As it is written , “ He catches the wise in their craftiness . ”
46003020	And again , “ The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile . ”
46003021	So then , no more boasting about mere mortals ! For everything belongs to you ,
46003022	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future . Everything belongs to you ,
46003023	and you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
46004001	One should think about us this way – as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God .
46004002	Now what is sought in stewards is that one be found faithful .
46004003	So for me , it is a minor matter that I am judged by you or by any human court . In fact , I do not even judge myself .
46004004	For I am not aware of anything against myself , but I am not acquitted because of this . The one who judges me is the Lord .
46004005	So then , do not judge anything before the time . Wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the motives of hearts . Then each will receive recognition from God .
46004006	I have applied these things to myself and Apollos because of you , brothers and sisters , so that through us you may learn “ not to go beyond what is written , ” so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of the one against the other .
46004007	For who concedes you any superiority ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you received it , why do you boast as though you did not ?
46004008	Already you are satisfied ! Already you are rich ! You have become kings without us ! I wish you had become kings so that we could reign with you !
46004009	For , I think , God has exhibited us apostles last of all , as men condemned to die , because we have become a spectacle to the world , both to angels and to people .
46004010	We are fools for Christ , but you are wise in Christ ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are distinguished , we are dishonored !
46004011	To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty , poorly clothed , brutally treated , and without a roof over our heads .
46004012	We do hard work , toiling with our own hands . When we are verbally abused , we respond with a blessing , when persecuted , we endure ,
46004013	when people lie about us , we answer in a friendly manner . We are the world’s dirt and scum , even now .
46004014	I am not writing these things to shame you , but to correct you as my dear children .
46004015	For though you may have ten thousand guardians in Christ , you do not have many fathers , because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel .
46004016	I encourage you , then , be imitators of me .
46004017	For this reason , I have sent Timothy to you , who is my dear and faithful son in the Lord . He will remind you of my ways in Christ , as I teach them everywhere in every church .
46004018	Some have become arrogant , as if I were not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you soon , if the Lord is willing , and I will find out not only the talk of these arrogant people , but also their power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God is demonstrated not in idle talk but with power .
46004021	What do you want ? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline or with love and a spirit of gentleness ?
46005001	It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you , the kind of immorality that is not permitted even among the Gentiles , so that someone is cohabiting with his father’s wife .
46005002	And you are proud ! Shouldn’t you have been deeply sorrowful instead and removed the one who did this from among you ?
46005003	For even though I am absent physically , I am present in spirit . And I have already judged the one who did this , just as though I were present .
46005004	When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus , and I am with you in spirit , along with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	turn this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord .
46005006	Your boasting is not good . Don’t you know that a little yeast affects the whole batch of dough ?
46005007	Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough – you are , in fact , without yeast . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
46005008	So then , let us celebrate the festival , not with the old yeast , the yeast of vice and evil , but with the bread without yeast , the bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people .
46005010	In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world , or the greedy and swindlers and idolaters , since you would then have to go out of the world .
46005011	But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who calls himself a Christian who is sexually immoral , or greedy , or an idolater , or verbally abusive , or a drunkard , or a swindler . Do not even eat with such a person .
46005012	For what do I have to do with judging those outside ? Are you not to judge those inside ?
46005013	But God will judge those outside . Remove the evil person from among you .
46006001	When any of you has a legal dispute with another , does he dare go to court before the unrighteous rather than before the saints ?
46006002	Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is to be judged by you , are you not competent to settle trivial suits ?
46006003	Do you not know that we will judge angels ? Why not ordinary matters !
46006004	So if you have ordinary lawsuits , do you appoint as judges those who have no standing in the church ?
46006005	I say this to your shame ! Is there no one among you wise enough to settle disputes between fellow Christians ?
46006006	Instead , does a Christian sue a Christian , and do this before unbelievers ?
46006007	The fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves demonstrates that you have already been defeated . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ?
46006008	But you yourselves wrong and cheat , and you do this to your brothers and sisters !
46006009	Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived ! The sexually immoral , idolaters , adulterers , passive homosexual partners , practicing homosexuals ,
46006010	thieves , the greedy , drunkards , the verbally abusive , and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	Some of you once lived this way . But you were washed , you were sanctified , you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God .
46006012	“ All things are lawful for me ” – but not everything is beneficial . “ All things are lawful for me ” – but I will not be controlled by anything .
46006013	“ Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food , but God will do away with both . ” The body is not for sexual immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
46006014	Now God indeed raised the Lord and he will raise us by his power .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? Never !
46006016	Or do you not know that anyone who is united with a prostitute is one body with her ? For it is said , “ The two will become one flesh . ”
46006017	But the one united with the Lord is one spirit with him .
46006018	Flee sexual immorality ! “ Every sin a person commits is outside of the body ” – but the immoral person sins against his own body .
46006019	Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you , whom you have from God , and you are not your own ?
46006020	For you were bought at a price . Therefore glorify God with your body .
46007001	Now with regard to the issues you wrote about : “ It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman . ”
46007002	But because of immoralities , each man should have relations with his own wife and each woman with her own husband .
46007003	A husband should give to his wife her sexual rights , and likewise a wife to her husband .
46007004	It is not the wife who has the rights to her own body , but the husband . In the same way , it is not the husband who has the rights to his own body , but the wife .
46007005	Do not deprive each other , except by mutual agreement for a specified time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer . Then resume your relationship , so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	I say this as a concession , not as a command .
46007007	I wish that everyone was as I am . But each has his own gift from God , one this way , another that .
46007008	To the unmarried and widows I say that it is best for them to remain as I am .
46007009	But if they do not have self-control , let them get married . For it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire .
46007010	To the married I give this command – not I , but the Lord – a wife should not divorce a husband
46007011	( but if she does , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband ) , and a husband should not divorce his wife .
46007012	To the rest I say – I , not the Lord – if a brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is happy to live with him , he should not divorce her .
46007013	And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is happy to live with her , she should not divorce him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified because of the wife , and the unbelieving wife because of her husband . Otherwise your children are unclean , but now they are holy .
46007015	But if the unbeliever wants a divorce , let it take place . In these circumstances the brother or sister is not bound . God has called you in peace .
46007016	For how do you know , wife , whether you will bring your husband to salvation ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will bring your wife to salvation ?
46007017	Nevertheless , as the Lord has assigned to each one , as God has called each person , so must he live . I give this sort of direction in all the churches .
46007018	Was anyone called after he had been circumcised ? He should not try to undo his circumcision . Was anyone called who is uncircumcised ? He should not get circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing . Instead , keeping God’s commandments is what counts .
46007020	Let each one remain in that situation in life in which he was called .
46007021	Were you called as a slave ? Do not worry about it . But if indeed you are able to be free , make the most of the opportunity .
46007022	For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman . In the same way , the one who was called as a free person is Christ’s slave .
46007023	You were bought with a price . Do not become slaves of men .
46007024	In whatever situation someone was called , brothers and sisters , let him remain in it with God .
46007025	With regard to the question about people who have never married , I have no command from the Lord , but I give my opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy .
46007026	Because of the impending crisis I think it best for you to remain as you are .
46007027	The one bound to a wife should not seek divorce . The one released from a wife should not seek marriage .
46007028	But if you marry , you have not sinned . And if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . But those who marry will face difficult circumstances , and I am trying to spare you such problems .
46007029	And I say this , brothers and sisters : The time is short . So then those who have wives should be as those who have none ,
46007030	those with tears like those not weeping , those who rejoice like those not rejoicing , those who buy like those without possessions ,
46007031	those who use the world as though they were not using it to the full . For the present shape of this world is passing away .
46007032	And I want you to be free from concern . An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord , how to please the Lord .
46007033	But a married man is concerned about the things of the world , how to please his wife ,
46007034	and he is divided . An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord , to be holy both in body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world , how to please her husband .
46007035	I am saying this for your benefit , not to place a limitation on you , but so that without distraction you may give notable and constant service to the Lord .
46007036	If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his virgin , if she is past the bloom of youth and it seems necessary , he should do what he wishes ; he does not sin . Let them marry .
46007037	But the man who is firm in his commitment , and is under no necessity but has control over his will , and has decided in his own mind to keep his own virgin , does well .
46007038	So then , the one who marries his own virgin does well , but the one who does not , does better .
46007039	A wife is bound as long as her husband is living . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry anyone she wishes ( only someone in the Lord ) .
46007040	But in my opinion , she will be happier if she remains as she is – and I think that I too have the Spirit of God !
46008001	With regard to food sacrificed to idols , we know that “ we all have knowledge . ” Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up .
46008002	If someone thinks he knows something , he does not yet know to the degree that he needs to know .
46008003	But if someone loves God , he is known by God .
46008004	With regard then to eating food sacrificed to idols , we know that “ an idol in this world is nothing , ” and that “ there is no God but one . ”
46008005	If after all there are so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ( as there are many gods and many lords ) ,
46008006	yet for us there is one God , the Father , from whom are all things and for whom we live , and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things and through whom we live .
46008007	But this knowledge is not shared by all . And some , by being accustomed to idols in former times , eat this food as an idol sacrifice , and their conscience , because it is weak , is defiled .
46008008	Now food will not bring us close to God . We are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do .
46008009	But be careful that this liberty of yours does not become a hindrance to the weak .
46008010	For if someone weak sees you who possess knowledge dining in an idol’s temple , will not his conscience be “ strengthened ” to eat food offered to idols ?
46008011	So by your knowledge the weak brother or sister , for whom Christ died , is destroyed .
46008012	If you sin against your brothers or sisters in this way and wound their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
46008013	For this reason , if food causes my brother or sister to sin , I will never eat meat again , so that I may not cause one of them to sin .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not my work in the Lord ?
46009002	If I am not an apostle to others , at least I am to you , for you are the confirming sign of my apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	This is my defense to those who examine me .
46009004	Do we not have the right to financial support ?
46009005	Do we not have the right to the company of a believing wife , like the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas ?
46009006	Or do only Barnabas and I lack the right not to work ?
46009007	Who ever serves in the army at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit ? Who tends a flock and does not consume its milk ?
46009008	Am I saying these things only on the basis of common sense , or does the law not say this as well ?
46009009	For it is written in the law of Moses , “ Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain . ” God is not concerned here about oxen , is he ?
46009010	Or is he not surely speaking for our benefit ? It was written for us , because the one plowing and threshing ought to work in hope of enjoying the harvest .
46009011	If we sowed spiritual blessings among you , is it too much to reap material things from you ?
46009012	If others receive this right from you , are we not more deserving ? But we have not made use of this right . Instead we endure everything so that we may not be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ .
46009013	Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple eat food from the temple , and those who serve at the altar receive a part of the offerings ?
46009014	In the same way the Lord commanded those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel .
46009015	But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing these things so that something will be done for me . In fact , it would be better for me to die than – no one will deprive me of my reason for boasting !
46009016	For if I preach the gospel , I have no reason for boasting , because I am compelled to do this . Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel !
46009017	For if I do this voluntarily , I have a reward . But if I do it unwillingly , I am entrusted with a responsibility .
46009018	What then is my reward ? That when I preach the gospel I may offer the gospel free of charge , and so not make full use of my rights in the gospel .
46009019	For since I am free from all I can make myself a slave to all , in order to gain even more people .
46009020	To the Jews I became like a Jew to gain the Jews . To those under the law I became like one under the law ( though I myself am not under the law ) to gain those under the law .
46009021	To those free from the law I became like one free from the law ( though I am not free from God’s law but under the law of Christ ) to gain those free from the law .
46009022	To the weak I became weak in order to gain the weak . I have become all things to all people , so that by all means I may save some .
46009023	I do all these things because of the gospel , so that I can be a participant in it .
46009024	Do you not know that all the runners in a stadium compete , but only one receives the prize ? So run to win .
46009025	Each competitor must exercise self-control in everything . They do it to receive a perishable crown , but we an imperishable one .
46009026	So I do not run uncertainly or box like one who hits only air .
46009027	Instead I subdue my body and make it my slave , so that after preaching to others I myself will not be disqualified .
46010001	For I do not want you to be unaware , brothers and sisters , that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea ,
46010002	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ,
46010003	and all ate the same spiritual food ,
46010004	and all drank the same spiritual drink . For they were all drinking from the spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
46010005	But God was not pleased with most of them , for they were cut down in the wilderness .
46010006	These things happened as examples for us , so that we will not crave evil things as they did .
46010007	So do not be idolaters , as some of them were . As it is written , “ The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play . ”
46010008	And let us not be immoral , as some of them were , and twenty-three thousand died in a single day .
46010009	And let us not put Christ to the test , as some of them did , and were destroyed by snakes .
46010010	And do not complain , as some of them did , and were killed by the destroying angel .
46010011	These things happened to them as examples and were written for our instruction , on whom the ends of the ages have come .
46010012	So let the one who thinks he is standing be careful that he does not fall .
46010013	No trial has overtaken you that is not faced by others . And God is faithful : He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear , but with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it .
46010014	So then , my dear friends , flee from idolatry .
46010015	I am speaking to thoughtful people . Consider what I say .
46010016	Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Because there is one bread , we who are many are one body , for we all share the one bread .
46010018	Look at the people of Israel . Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar ?
46010019	Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything ?
46010020	No , I mean that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God . I do not want you to be partners with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
46010022	Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we really stronger than he is ?
46010023	“ Everything is lawful , ” but not everything is beneficial . “ Everything is lawful , ” but not everything builds others up .
46010024	Do not seek your own good , but the good of the other person .
46010025	Eat anything that is sold in the marketplace without questions of conscience ,
46010026	for the earth and its abundance are the Lord’s .
46010027	If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go , eat whatever is served without asking questions of conscience .
46010028	But if someone says to you , “ This is from a sacrifice , ” do not eat , because of the one who told you and because of conscience –
46010029	I do not mean yours but the other person’s . For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience ?
46010030	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I blamed for the food that I give thanks for ?
46010031	So whether you eat or drink , or whatever you do , do everything for the glory of God .
46010032	Do not give offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God ,
46010033	just as I also try to please everyone in all things . I do not seek my own benefit , but the benefit of many , so that they may be saved .
46011001	Be imitators of me , just as I also am of Christ .
46011002	I praise you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as I passed them on to you .
46011003	But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man , and the man is the head of a woman , and God is the head of Christ .
46011004	Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head .
46011005	But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered disgraces her head , for it is one and the same thing as having a shaved head .
46011006	For if a woman will not cover her head , she should cut off her hair . But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved , she should cover her head .
46011007	For a man should not have his head covered , since he is the image and glory of God . But the woman is the glory of the man .
46011008	For man did not come from woman , but woman from man .
46011009	Neither was man created for the sake of woman , but woman for man .
46011010	For this reason a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
46011011	In any case , in the Lord woman is not independent of man , nor is man independent of woman .
46011012	For just as woman came from man , so man comes through woman . But all things come from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves : Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a disgrace for him ,
46011015	but if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? For her hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	If anyone intends to quarrel about this , we have no other practice , nor do the churches of God .
46011017	Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you , because you come together not for the better but for the worse .
46011018	For in the first place , when you come together as a church I hear there are divisions among you , and in part I believe it .
46011019	For there must in fact be divisions among you , so that those of you who are approved may be evident .
46011020	Now when you come together at the same place , you are not really eating the Lord’s Supper .
46011021	For when it is time to eat , everyone proceeds with his own supper . One is hungry and another becomes drunk .
46011022	Do you not have houses so that you can eat and drink ? Or are you trying to show contempt for the church of God by shaming those who have nothing ? What should I say to you ? Should I praise you ? I will not praise you for this !
46011023	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you , that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread ,
46011024	and after he had given thanks he broke it and said , “ This is my body , which is for you . Do this in remembrance of me . ”
46011025	In the same way , he also took the cup after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , every time you drink it , in remembrance of me . ”
46011026	For every time you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes .
46011027	For this reason , whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	A person should examine himself first , and in this way let him eat the bread and drink of the cup .
46011029	For the one who eats and drinks without careful regard for the body eats and drinks judgment against himself .
46011030	That is why many of you are weak and sick , and quite a few are dead .
46011031	But if we examined ourselves , we would not be judged .
46011032	But when we are judged by the Lord , we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned with the world .
46011033	So then , my brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
46011034	If anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , so that when you assemble it does not lead to judgment . I will give directions about other matters when I come .
46012001	With regard to spiritual gifts , brothers and sisters , I do not want you to be uninformed .
46012002	You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols , however you were led .
46012003	So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says , “ Jesus is cursed , ” and no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” except by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Now there are different gifts , but the same Spirit .
46012005	And there are different ministries , but the same Lord .
46012006	And there are different results , but the same God who produces all of them in everyone .
46012007	To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all .
46012008	For one person is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom , and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit ,
46012009	to another faith by the same Spirit , and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit ,
46012010	to another performance of miracles , to another prophecy , and to another discernment of spirits , to another different kinds of tongues , and to another the interpretation of tongues .
46012011	It is one and the same Spirit , distributing as he decides to each person , who produces all these things .
46012012	For just as the body is one and yet has many members , and all the members of the body – though many – are one body , so too is Christ .
46012013	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body . Whether Jews or Greeks or slaves or free , we were all made to drink of the one Spirit .
46012014	For in fact the body is not a single member , but many .
46012015	If the foot says , “ Since I am not a hand , I am not part of the body , ” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that .
46012016	And if the ear says , “ Since I am not an eye , I am not part of the body , ” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , what part would do the hearing ? If the whole were an ear , what part would exercise the sense of smell ?
46012018	But as a matter of fact , God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided .
46012019	If they were all the same member , where would the body be ?
46012020	So now there are many members , but one body .
46012021	The eye cannot say to the hand , “ I do not need you , ” nor in turn can the head say to the foot , “ I do not need you . ”
46012022	On the contrary , those members that seem to be weaker are essential ,
46012023	and those members we consider less honorable we clothe with greater honor , and our unpresentable members are clothed with dignity ,
46012024	but our presentable members do not need this . Instead , God has blended together the body , giving greater honor to the lesser member ,
46012025	so that there may be no division in the body , but the members may have mutual concern for one another .
46012026	If one member suffers , everyone suffers with it . If a member is honored , all rejoice with it .
46012027	Now you are Christ’s body , and each of you is a member of it .
46012028	And God has placed in the church first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , gifts of healing , helps , gifts of leadership , different kinds of tongues .
46012029	Not all are apostles , are they ? Not all are prophets , are they ? Not all are teachers , are they ? Not all perform miracles , do they ?
46012030	Not all have gifts of healing , do they ? Not all speak in tongues , do they ? Not all interpret , do they ?
46012031	But you should be eager for the greater gifts . And now I will show you a way that is beyond comparison .
46013001	If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels , but I do not have love , I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	And if I have prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing .
46013003	If I give away everything I own , and if I give over my body in order to boast , but do not have love , I receive no benefit .
46013004	Love is patient , love is kind , it is not envious . Love does not brag , it is not puffed up .
46013005	It is not rude , it is not self-serving , it is not easily angered or resentful .
46013006	It is not glad about injustice , but rejoices in the truth .
46013007	It bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
46013008	Love never ends . But if there are prophecies , they will be set aside ; if there are tongues , they will cease ; if there is knowledge , it will be set aside .
46013009	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part ,
46013010	but when what is perfect comes , the partial will be set aside .
46013011	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . But when I became an adult , I set aside childish ways .
46013012	For now we see in a mirror indirectly , but then we will see face to face . Now I know in part , but then I will know fully , just as I have been fully known .
46013013	And now these three remain : faith , hope , and love . But the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Pursue love and be eager for the spiritual gifts , especially that you may prophesy .
46014002	For the one speaking in a tongue does not speak to people but to God , for no one understands ; he is speaking mysteries by the Spirit .
46014003	But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening , encouragement , and consolation .
46014004	The one who speaks in a tongue builds himself up , but the one who prophesies builds up the church .
46014005	I wish you all spoke in tongues , but even more that you would prophesy . The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues , unless he interprets so that the church may be strengthened .
46014006	Now , brothers and sisters , if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I help you unless I speak to you with a revelation or with knowledge or prophecy or teaching ?
46014007	It is similar for lifeless things that make a sound , like a flute or harp . Unless they make a distinction in the notes , how can what is played on the flute or harp be understood ?
46014008	If , for example , the trumpet makes an unclear sound , who will get ready for battle ?
46014009	It is the same for you . If you do not speak clearly with your tongue , how will anyone know what is being said ? For you will be speaking into the air .
46014010	There are probably many kinds of languages in the world , and none is without meaning .
46014011	If then I do not know the meaning of a language , I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me .
46014012	It is the same with you . Since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit , seek to abound in order to strengthen the church .
46014013	So then , one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret .
46014014	If I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is unproductive .
46014015	What should I do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my mind . I will sing praises with my spirit , but I will also sing praises with my mind .
46014016	Otherwise , if you are praising God with your spirit , how can someone without the gift say “ Amen ” to your thanksgiving , since he does not know what you are saying ?
46014017	For you are certainly giving thanks well , but the other person is not strengthened .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you ,
46014019	but in the church I want to speak five words with my mind to instruct others , rather than ten thousand words in a tongue .
46014020	Brothers and sisters , do not be children in your thinking . Instead , be infants in evil , but in your thinking be mature .
46014021	It is written in the law : “ By people with strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people , yet not even in this way will they listen to me , ” says the Lord .
46014022	So then , tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers . Prophecy , however , is not for unbelievers but for believers .
46014023	So if the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues , and unbelievers or uninformed people enter , will they not say that you have lost your minds ?
46014024	But if all prophesy , and an unbeliever or uninformed person enters , he will be convicted by all , he will be called to account by all .
46014025	The secrets of his heart are disclosed , and in this way he will fall down with his face to the ground and worship God , declaring , “ God is really among you . ”
46014026	What should you do then , brothers and sisters ? When you come together , each one has a song , has a lesson , has a revelation , has a tongue , has an interpretation . Let all these things be done for the strengthening of the church .
46014027	If someone speaks in a tongue , it should be two , or at the most three , one after the other , and someone must interpret .
46014028	But if there is no interpreter , he should be silent in the church . Let him speak to himself and to God .
46014029	Two or three prophets should speak and the others should evaluate what is said .
46014030	And if someone sitting down receives a revelation , the person who is speaking should conclude .
46014031	For you can all prophesy one after another , so all can learn and be encouraged .
46014032	Indeed , the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets ,
46014033	for God is not characterized by disorder but by peace . As in all the churches of the saints ,
46014034	the women should be silent in the churches , for they are not permitted to speak . Rather , let them be in submission , as in fact the law says .
46014035	If they want to find out about something , they should ask their husbands at home , because it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church .
46014036	Did the word of God begin with you , or did it come to you alone ?
46014037	If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person , he should acknowledge that what I write to you is the Lord’s command .
46014038	If someone does not recognize this , he is not recognized .
46014039	So then , brothers and sisters , be eager to prophesy , and do not forbid anyone from speaking in tongues .
46014040	And do everything in a decent and orderly manner .
46015001	Now I want to make clear for you , brothers and sisters , the gospel that I preached to you , that you received and on which you stand ,
46015002	and by which you are being saved , if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you – unless you believed in vain .
46015003	For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received – that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ,
46015004	and that he was buried , and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures ,
46015005	and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve .
46015006	Then he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at one time , most of whom are still alive , though some have fallen asleep .
46015007	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
46015008	Last of all , as though to one born at the wrong time , he appeared to me also .
46015009	For I am the least of the apostles , unworthy to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace to me has not been in vain . In fact , I worked harder than all of them – yet not I , but the grace of God with me .
46015011	Whether then it was I or they , this is the way we preach and this is the way you believed .
46015012	Now if Christ is being preached as raised from the dead , how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , then not even Christ has been raised .
46015014	And if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is futile and your faith is empty .
46015015	Also , we are found to be false witnesses about God , because we have testified against God that he raised Christ from the dead , when in reality he did not raise him , if indeed the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , then not even Christ has been raised .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is useless ; you are still in your sins .
46015018	Furthermore , those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished .
46015019	For if only in this life we have hope in Christ , we should be pitied more than anyone .
46015020	But now Christ has been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep .
46015021	For since death came through a man , the resurrection of the dead also came through a man .
46015022	For just as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
46015023	But each in his own order : Christ , the firstfruits ; then when Christ comes , those who belong to him .
46015024	Then comes the end , when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father , when he has brought to an end all rule and all authority and power .
46015025	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be eliminated is death .
46015027	For he has put everything in subjection under his feet . But when it says “ everything ” has been put in subjection , it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection to him .
46015028	And when all things are subjected to him , then the Son himself will be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him , so that God may be all in all .
46015029	Otherwise , what will those do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , then why are they baptized for them ?
46015030	Why too are we in danger every hour ?
46015031	Every day I am in danger of death ! This is as sure as my boasting in you , which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .
46015032	If from a human point of view I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus , what did it benefit me ? If the dead are not raised , let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die .
46015033	Do not be deceived : “ Bad company corrupts good morals . ”
46015034	Sober up as you should , and stop sinning ! For some have no knowledge of God – I say this to your shame !
46015035	But someone will say , “ How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body will they come ? ”
46015036	Fool ! What you sow will not come to life unless it dies .
46015037	And what you sow is not the body that is to be , but a bare seed – perhaps of wheat or something else .
46015038	But God gives it a body just as he planned , and to each of the seeds a body of its own .
46015039	All flesh is not the same : People have one flesh , animals have another , birds and fish another .
46015040	And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . The glory of the heavenly body is one sort and the earthly another .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars , for star differs from star in glory .
46015042	It is the same with the resurrection of the dead . What is sown is perishable , what is raised is imperishable .
46015043	It is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
46015044	it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	So also it is written , “ The first man , Adam , became a living person ” ; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
46015046	However , the spiritual did not come first , but the natural , and then the spiritual .
46015047	The first man is from the earth , made of dust ; the second man is from heaven .
46015048	Like the one made of dust , so too are those made of dust , and like the one from heaven , so too those who are heavenly .
46015049	And just as we have borne the image of the man of dust , let us also bear the image of the man of heaven .
46015050	Now this is what I am saying , brothers and sisters : Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God , nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable .
46015051	Listen , I will tell you a mystery : We will not all sleep , but we will all be changed –
46015052	in a moment , in the blinking of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we will be changed .
46015053	For this perishable body must put on the imperishable , and this mortal body must put on immortality .
46015054	Now when this perishable puts on the imperishable , and this mortal puts on immortality , then the saying that is written will happen , “ Death has been swallowed up in victory . ”
46015055	“ Where , O death , is your victory ? Where , O death , is your sting ? ”
46015056	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !
46015058	So then , dear brothers and sisters , be firm . Do not be moved ! Always be outstanding in the work of the Lord , knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
46016001	With regard to the collection for the saints , please follow the directions that I gave to the churches of Galatia :
46016002	On the first day of the week , each of you should set aside some income and save it to the extent that God has blessed you , so that a collection will not have to be made when I come .
46016003	Then , when I arrive , I will send those whom you approve with letters of explanation to carry your gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	And if it seems advisable that I should go also , they will go with me .
46016005	But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia – for I will be going through Macedonia –
46016006	and perhaps I will stay with you , or even spend the winter , so that you can send me on my journey , wherever I go .
46016007	For I do not want to see you now in passing , since I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord allows .
46016008	But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	because a door of great opportunity stands wide open for me , but there are many opponents .
46016010	Now if Timothy comes , see that he has nothing to fear among you , for he is doing the Lord’s work , as I am too .
46016011	So then , let no one treat him with contempt . But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me . For I am expecting him with the brothers .
46016012	With regard to our brother Apollos : I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers , but it was simply not his intention to come now . He will come when he has the opportunity .
46016013	Stay alert , stand firm in the faith , show courage , be strong .
46016014	Everything you do should be done in love .
46016015	Now , brothers and sisters , you know about the household of Stephanus , that as the first converts of Achaia , they devoted themselves to ministry for the saints . I urge you
46016016	also to submit to people like this , and to everyone who cooperates in the work and labors hard .
46016017	I was glad about the arrival of Stephanus , Fortunatus , and Achaicus because they have supplied the fellowship with you that I lacked .
46016018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours . So then , recognize people like this .
46016019	The churches in the province of Asia send greetings to you . Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord , with the church that meets in their house .
46016020	All the brothers and sisters send greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	I , Paul , send this greeting with my own hand .
46016022	Let anyone who has no love for the Lord be accursed . Our Lord , come !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus .
47001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the church of God that is in Corinth , with all the saints who are in all Achaia .
47001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
47001003	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ,
47001004	who comforts us in all our troubles so that we may be able to comfort those experiencing any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
47001005	For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow toward us , so also our comfort through Christ overflows to you .
47001006	But if we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation ; if we are comforted , it is for your comfort that you experience in your patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer .
47001007	And our hope for you is steadfast because we know that as you share in our sufferings , so also you will share in our comfort .
47001008	For we do not want you to be unaware , brothers and sisters , regarding the affliction that happened to us in the province of Asia , that we were burdened excessively , beyond our strength , so that we despaired even of living .
47001009	Indeed we felt as if the sentence of death had been passed against us , so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead .
47001010	He delivered us from so great a risk of death , and he will deliver us . We have set our hope on him that he will deliver us yet again ,
47001011	as you also join in helping us by prayer , so that many people may give thanks to God on our behalf for the gracious gift given to us through the help of many .
47001012	For our reason for confidence is this : the testimony of our conscience , that with pure motives and sincerity which are from God – not by human wisdom but by the grace of God – we conducted ourselves in the world , and all the more toward you .
47001013	For we do not write you anything other than what you can read and also understand . But I hope that you will understand completely
47001014	just as also you have partly understood us , that we are your source of pride just as you also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus .
47001015	And with this confidence I intended to come to you first so that you would get a second opportunity to see us ,
47001016	and through your help to go on into Macedonia and then from Macedonia to come back to you and be helped on our way into Judea by you .
47001017	Therefore when I was planning to do this , I did not do so without thinking about what I was doing , did I ? Or do I make my plans according to mere human standards so that I would be saying both “ Yes , yes ” and “ No , no ” at the same time ?
47001018	But as God is faithful , our message to you is not “ Yes ” and “ No . ”
47001019	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , the one who was proclaimed among you by us – by me and Silvanus and Timothy – was not “ Yes ” and “ No , ” but it has always been “ Yes ” in him .
47001020	For every one of God’s promises are “ Yes ” in him ; therefore also through him the “ Amen ” is spoken , to the glory we give to God .
47001021	But it is God who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anointed us ,
47001022	who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a down payment .
47001023	Now I appeal to God as my witness , that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth .
47001024	I do not mean that we rule over your faith , but we are workers with you for your joy , because by faith you stand firm .
47002001	So I made up my own mind not to pay you another painful visit .
47002002	For if I make you sad , who would be left to make me glad but the one I caused to be sad ?
47002003	And I wrote this very thing to you , so that when I came I would not have sadness from those who ought to make me rejoice , since I am confident in you all that my joy would be yours .
47002004	For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears , not to make you sad , but to let you know the love that I have especially for you .
47002005	But if anyone has caused sadness , he has not saddened me alone , but to some extent ( not to exaggerate ) he has saddened all of you as well .
47002006	This punishment on such an individual by the majority is enough for him ,
47002007	so that now instead you should rather forgive and comfort him . This will keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive grief to the point of despair .
47002008	Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him .
47002009	For this reason also I wrote you : to test you to see if you are obedient in everything .
47002010	If you forgive anyone for anything , I also forgive him – for indeed what I have forgiven ( if I have forgiven anything ) I did so for you in the presence of Christ ,
47002011	so that we may not be exploited by Satan ( for we are not ignorant of his schemes ) .
47002012	Now when I arrived in Troas to proclaim the gospel of Christ , even though the Lord had opened a door of opportunity for me ,
47002013	I had no relief in my spirit , because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I said good-bye to them and set out for Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and who makes known through us the fragrance that consists of the knowledge of him in every place .
47002015	For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing –
47002016	to the latter an odor from death to death , but to the former a fragrance from life to life . And who is adequate for these things ?
47002017	For we are not like so many others , hucksters who peddle the word of God for profit , but we are speaking in Christ before God as persons of sincerity , as persons sent from God .
47003001	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? We don’t need letters of recommendation to you or from you as some other people do , do we ?
47003002	You yourselves are our letter , written on our hearts , known and read by everyone ,
47003003	revealing that you are a letter of Christ , delivered by us , written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God , not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts .
47003004	Now we have such confidence in God through Christ .
47003005	Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as if it were coming from ourselves , but our adequacy is from God ,
47003006	who made us adequate to be servants of a new covenant not based on the letter but on the Spirit , for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	But if the ministry that produced death – carved in letters on stone tablets – came with glory , so that the Israelites could not keep their eyes fixed on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face ( a glory which was made ineffective ) ,
47003008	how much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be ?
47003009	For if there was glory in the ministry that produced condemnation , how much more does the ministry that produces righteousness excel in glory !
47003010	For indeed , what had been glorious now has no glory because of the tremendously greater glory of what replaced it .
47003011	For if what was made ineffective came with glory , how much more has what remains come in glory !
47003012	Therefore , since we have such a hope , we behave with great boldness ,
47003013	and not like Moses who used to put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from staring at the result of the glory that was made ineffective .
47003014	But their minds were closed . For to this very day , the same veil remains when they hear the old covenant read . It has not been removed because only in Christ is it taken away .
47003015	But until this very day whenever Moses is read , a veil lies over their minds ,
47003016	but when one turns to the Lord , the veil is removed .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is present , there is freedom .
47003018	And we all , with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord , are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another , which is from the Lord , who is the Spirit .
47004001	Therefore , since we have this ministry , just as God has shown us mercy , we do not become discouraged .
47004002	But we have rejected shameful hidden deeds , not behaving with deceptiveness or distorting the word of God , but by open proclamation of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience before God .
47004003	But even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled only to those who are perishing ,
47004004	among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who do not believe so they would not see the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God .
47004005	For we do not proclaim ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake .
47004006	For God , who said “ Let light shine out of darkness , ” is the one who shined in our hearts to give us the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in clay jars , so that the extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us .
47004008	We are experiencing trouble on every side , but are not crushed ; we are perplexed , but not driven to despair ;
47004009	we are persecuted , but not abandoned ; we are knocked down , but not destroyed ,
47004010	always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our body .
47004011	For we who are alive are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake , so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our mortal body .
47004012	As a result , death is at work in us , but life is at work in you .
47004013	But since we have the same spirit of faith as that shown in what has been written , “ I believed ; therefore I spoke , ” we also believe , therefore we also speak .
47004014	We do so because we know that the one who raised up Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus and will bring us with you into his presence .
47004015	For all these things are for your sake , so that the grace that is including more and more people may cause thanksgiving to increase to the glory of God .
47004016	Therefore we do not despair , but even if our physical body is wearing away , our inner person is being renewed day by day .
47004017	For our momentary , light suffering is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison
47004018	because we are not looking at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen . For what can be seen is temporary , but what cannot be seen is eternal .
47005001	For we know that if our earthly house , the tent we live in , is dismantled , we have a building from God , a house not built by human hands , that is eternal in the heavens .
47005002	For in this earthly house we groan , because we desire to put on our heavenly dwelling ,
47005003	if indeed , after we have put on our heavenly house , we will not be found naked .
47005004	For we groan while we are in this tent , since we are weighed down , because we do not want to be unclothed , but clothed , so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
47005005	Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose is God , who gave us the Spirit as a down payment .
47005006	Therefore we are always full of courage , and we know that as long as we are alive here on earth we are absent from the Lord –
47005007	for we live by faith , not by sight .
47005008	Thus we are full of courage and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord .
47005009	So then whether we are alive or away , we make it our ambition to please him .
47005010	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may be paid back according to what he has done while in the body , whether good or evil .
47005011	Therefore , because we know the fear of the Lord , we try to persuade people , but we are well known to God , and I hope we are well known to your consciences too .
47005012	We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again , but are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us , so that you may be able to answer those who take pride in outward appearance and not in what is in the heart .
47005013	For if we are out of our minds , it is for God ; if we are of sound mind , it is for you .
47005014	For the love of Christ controls us , since we have concluded this , that Christ died for all ; therefore all have died .
47005015	And he died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised .
47005016	So then from now on we acknowledge no one from an outward human point of view . Even though we have known Christ from such a human point of view , now we do not know him in that way any longer .
47005017	So then , if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation ; what is old has passed away – look , what is new has come !
47005018	And all these things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ , and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation .
47005019	In other words , in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself , not counting people’s trespasses against them , and he has given us the message of reconciliation .
47005020	Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God were making His plea through us . We plead with you on Christ’s behalf , “ Be reconciled to God ! ”
47005021	God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us , so that in him we would become the righteousness of God .
47006001	Now because we are fellow workers , we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain .
47006002	For he says , “ I heard you at the acceptable time , and in the day of salvation I helped you . ” Look , now is the acceptable time ; look , now is the day of salvation !
47006003	We do not give anyone an occasion for taking an offense in anything , so that no fault may be found with our ministry .
47006004	But as God’s servants , we have commended ourselves in every way , with great endurance , in persecutions , in difficulties , in distresses ,
47006005	in beatings , in imprisonments , in riots , in troubles , in sleepless nights , in hunger ,
47006006	by purity , by knowledge , by patience , by benevolence , by the Holy Spirit , by genuine love ,
47006007	by truthful teaching , by the power of God , with weapons of righteousness both for the right hand and for the left ,
47006008	through glory and dishonor , through slander and praise ; regarded as impostors , and yet true ;
47006009	as unknown , and yet well-known ; as dying and yet – see ! – we continue to live ; as those who are scourged and yet not executed ;
47006010	as sorrowful , but always rejoicing , as poor , but making many rich , as having nothing , and yet possessing everything .
47006011	We have spoken freely to you , Corinthians ; our heart has been opened wide to you .
47006012	Our affection for you is not restricted , but you are restricted in your affections for us .
47006013	Now as a fair exchange – I speak as to my children – open wide your hearts to us also .
47006014	Do not become partners with those who do not believe , for what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness , or what fellowship does light have with darkness ?
47006015	And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar ? Or what does a believer share in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	And what mutual agreement does the temple of God have with idols ? For we are the temple of the living God , just as God said , “ I will live in them and will walk among them , and I will be their God , and they will be my people . ”
47006017	Therefore “ come out from their midst , and be separate , ” says the Lord , “ and touch no unclean thing , and I will welcome you ,
47006018	and I will be a father to you , and you will be my sons and daughters , ” says the All-Powerful Lord .
47007001	Therefore , since we have these promises , dear friends , let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit , and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God .
47007002	Make room for us in your hearts ; we have wronged no one , we have ruined no one , we have exploited no one .
47007003	I do not say this to condemn you , for I told you before that you are in our hearts so that we die together and live together with you .
47007004	I have great confidence in you ; I take great pride on your behalf . I am filled with encouragement ; I am overflowing with joy in the midst of all our suffering .
47007005	For even when we came into Macedonia , our body had no rest at all , but we were troubled in every way – struggles from the outside , fears from within .
47007006	But God , who encourages the downhearted , encouraged us by the arrival of Titus .
47007007	We were encouraged not only by his arrival , but also by the encouragement you gave him , as he reported to us your longing , your mourning , your deep concern for me , so that I rejoiced more than ever .
47007008	For even if I made you sad by my letter , I do not regret having written it ( even though I did regret it , for I see that my letter made you sad , though only for a short time ) .
47007009	Now I rejoice , not because you were made sad , but because you were made sad to the point of repentance . For you were made sad as God intended , so that you were not harmed in any way by us .
47007010	For sadness as intended by God produces a repentance that leads to salvation , leaving no regret , but worldly sadness brings about death .
47007011	For see what this very thing , this sadness as God intended , has produced in you : what eagerness , what defense of yourselves , what indignation , what alarm , what longing , what deep concern , what punishment ! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter .
47007012	So then , even though I wrote to you , it was not on account of the one who did wrong , or on account of the one who was wronged , but to reveal to you your eagerness on our behalf before God .
47007013	Therefore we have been encouraged . And in addition to our own encouragement , we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus , because all of you have refreshed his spirit .
47007014	For if I have boasted to him about anything concerning you , I have not been embarrassed by you , but just as everything we said to you was true , so our boasting to Titus about you has proved true as well .
47007015	And his affection for you is much greater when he remembers the obedience of you all , how you welcomed him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I rejoice because in everything I am fully confident in you .
47008001	Now we make known to you , brothers and sisters , the grace of God given to the churches of Macedonia ,
47008002	that during a severe ordeal of suffering , their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth of their generosity .
47008003	For I testify , they gave according to their means and beyond their means . They did so voluntarily ,
47008004	begging us with great earnestness for the blessing and fellowship of helping the saints .
47008005	And they did this not just as we had hoped , but they gave themselves first to the Lord and to us by the will of God .
47008006	Thus we urged Titus that , just as he had previously begun this work , so also he should complete this act of kindness for you .
47008007	But as you excel in everything – in faith , in speech , in knowledge , and in all eagerness and in the love from us that is in you – make sure that you excel in this act of kindness too .
47008008	I am not saying this as a command , but I am testing the genuineness of your love by comparison with the eagerness of others .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that although he was rich , he became poor for your sakes , so that you by his poverty could become rich .
47008010	So here is my opinion on this matter : It is to your advantage , since you made a good start last year both in your giving and your desire to give ,
47008011	to finish what you started , so that just as you wanted to do it eagerly , you can also complete it according to your means .
47008012	For if the eagerness is present , the gift itself is acceptable according to whatever one has , not according to what he does not have .
47008013	For I do not say this so there would be relief for others and suffering for you , but as a matter of equality .
47008014	At the present time , your abundance will meet their need , so that one day their abundance may also meet your need , and thus there may be equality ,
47008015	as it is written : “ The one who gathered much did not have too much , and the one who gathered little did not have too little . ”
47008016	But thanks be to God who put in the heart of Titus the same devotion I have for you ,
47008017	because he not only accepted our request , but since he was very eager , he is coming to you of his own accord .
47008018	And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in spreading the gospel .
47008019	In addition , this brother has also been chosen by the churches as our traveling companion as we administer this generous gift to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help .
47008020	We did this as a precaution so that no one should blame us in regard to this generous gift we are administering .
47008021	For we are concerned about what is right not only before the Lord but also before men .
47008022	And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times and found eager in many matters , but who now is much more eager than ever because of the great confidence he has in you .
47008023	If there is any question about Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker among you ; if there is any question about our brothers , they are messengers of the churches , a glory to Christ .
47008024	Therefore show them openly before the churches the proof of your love and of our pride in you .
47009001	For it is not necessary for me to write you about this service to the saints ,
47009002	because I know your eagerness to help . I keep boasting to the Macedonians about this eagerness of yours , that Achaia has been ready to give since last year , and your zeal to participate has stirred up most of them .
47009003	But I am sending these brothers so that our boasting about you may not be empty in this case , so that you may be ready just as I kept telling them .
47009004	For if any of the Macedonians should come with me and find that you are not ready to give , we would be humiliated ( not to mention you ) by this confidence we had in you .
47009005	Therefore I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you in advance and to arrange ahead of time the generous contribution you had promised , so this may be ready as a generous gift and not as something you feel forced to do .
47009006	My point is this : The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and the person who sows generously will also reap generously .
47009007	Each one of you should give just as he has decided in his heart , not reluctantly or under compulsion , because God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	And God is able to make all grace overflow to you so that because you have enough of everything in every way at all times , you will overflow in every good work .
47009009	Just as it is written , “ He has scattered widely , he has given to the poor ; his righteousness remains forever . ”
47009010	Now God who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your supply of seed and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow .
47009011	You will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous on every occasion , which is producing through us thanksgiving to God ,
47009012	because the service of this ministry is not only providing for the needs of the saints but is also overflowing with many thanks to God .
47009013	Through the evidence of this service they will glorify God because of your obedience to your confession in the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your sharing with them and with everyone .
47009014	And in their prayers on your behalf they long for you because of the extraordinary grace God has shown to you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift !
47010001	Now I , Paul , appeal to you personally by the meekness and gentleness of Christ ( I who am meek when present among you , but am full of courage toward you when away ! ) –
47010002	now I ask that when I am present I may not have to be bold with the confidence that ( I expect ) I will dare to use against some who consider us to be behaving according to human standards .
47010003	For though we live as human beings , we do not wage war according to human standards ,
47010004	for the weapons of our warfare are not human weapons , but are made powerful by God for tearing down strongholds . We tear down arguments
47010005	and every arrogant obstacle that is raised up against the knowledge of God , and we take every thought captive to make it obey Christ .
47010006	We are also ready to punish every act of disobedience , whenever your obedience is complete .
47010007	You are looking at outward appearances . If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ , he should reflect on this again : Just as he himself belongs to Christ , so too do we .
47010008	For if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down , I will not be ashamed of doing so .
47010009	I do not want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters ,
47010010	because some say , “ His letters are weighty and forceful , but his physical presence is weak and his speech is of no account . ”
47010011	Let such a person consider this : What we say by letters when we are absent , we also are in actions when we are present .
47010012	For we would not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves . But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they are without understanding .
47010013	But we will not boast beyond certain limits , but will confine our boasting according to the limits of the work to which God has appointed us , that reaches even as far as you .
47010014	For we were not overextending ourselves , as though we did not reach as far as you , because we were the first to reach as far as you with the gospel about Christ .
47010015	Nor do we boast beyond certain limits in the work done by others , but we hope that as your faith continues to grow , our work may be greatly expanded among you according to our limits ,
47010016	so that we may preach the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you , and not boast of work already done in another person’s area .
47010017	But the one who boasts must boast in the Lord .
47010018	For it is not the person who commends himself who is approved , but the person the Lord commends .
47011001	I wish that you would be patient with me in a little foolishness , but indeed you are being patient with me !
47011002	For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy , because I promised you in marriage to one husband , to present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
47011003	But I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his treachery , your minds may be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ .
47011004	For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus different from the one we proclaimed , or if you receive a different spirit than the one you received , or a different gospel than the one you accepted , you put up with it well enough !
47011005	For I consider myself not at all inferior to those “ super-apostles . ”
47011006	And even if I am unskilled in speaking , yet I am certainly not so in knowledge . Indeed , we have made this plain to you in everything in every way .
47011007	Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you could be exalted , because I proclaimed the gospel of God to you free of charge ?
47011008	I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so that I could serve you !
47011009	When I was with you and was in need , I was not a burden to anyone , for the brothers who came from Macedonia fully supplied my needs . I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way , and will continue to do so .
47011010	As the truth of Christ is in me , this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia .
47011011	Why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
47011012	And what I am doing I will continue to do , so that I may eliminate any opportunity for those who want a chance to be regarded as our equals in the things they boast about .
47011013	For such people are false apostles , deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no wonder , for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light .
47011015	Therefore it is not surprising his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness , whose end will correspond to their actions .
47011016	I say again , let no one think that I am a fool . But if you do , then at least accept me as a fool , so that I too may boast a little .
47011017	What I am saying with this boastful confidence I do not say the way the Lord would . Instead it is , as it were , foolishness .
47011018	Since many are boasting according to human standards , I too will boast .
47011019	For since you are so wise , you put up with fools gladly .
47011020	For you put up with it if someone makes slaves of you , if someone exploits you , if someone takes advantage of you , if someone behaves arrogantly toward you , if someone strikes you in the face .
47011021	( To my disgrace I must say that we were too weak for that ! ) But whatever anyone else dares to boast about ( I am speaking foolishly ) , I also dare to boast about the same thing .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they descendants of Abraham ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? ( I am talking like I am out of my mind ! ) I am even more so : with much greater labors , with far more imprisonments , with more severe beatings , facing death many times .
47011024	Five times I received from the Jews forty lashes less one .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with a rod . Once I received a stoning . Three times I suffered shipwreck . A night and a day I spent adrift in the open sea .
47011026	I have been on journeys many times , in dangers from rivers , in dangers from robbers , in dangers from my own countrymen , in dangers from Gentiles , in dangers in the city , in dangers in the wilderness , in dangers at sea , in dangers from false brothers ,
47011027	in hard work and toil , through many sleepless nights , in hunger and thirst , many times without food , in cold and without enough clothing .
47011028	Apart from other things , there is the daily pressure on me of my anxious concern for all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is led into sin , and I do not burn with indignation ?
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast about the things that show my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , who is blessed forever , knows I am not lying .
47011032	In Damascus , the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to arrest me ,
47011033	but I was let down in a rope-basket through a window in the city wall , and escaped his hands .
47012001	It is necessary to go on boasting . Though it is not profitable , I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago ( whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , God knows ) was caught up to the third heaven .
47012003	And I know that this man ( whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know , God knows )
47012004	was caught up into paradise and heard things too sacred to be put into words , things that a person is not permitted to speak .
47012005	On behalf of such an individual I will boast , but on my own behalf I will not boast , except about my weaknesses .
47012006	For even if I wish to boast , I will not be a fool , for I would be telling the truth , but I refrain from this so that no one may regard me beyond what he sees in me or what he hears from me ,
47012007	even because of the extraordinary character of the revelations . Therefore , so that I would not become arrogant , a thorn in the flesh was given to me , a messenger of Satan to trouble me – so that I would not become arrogant .
47012008	I asked the Lord three times about this , that it would depart from me .
47012009	But he said to me , “ My grace is enough for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . ” So then , I will boast most gladly about my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ may reside in me .
47012010	Therefore I am content with weaknesses , with insults , with troubles , with persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ , for whenever I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I have become a fool . You yourselves forced me to do it , for I should have been commended by you . For I lack nothing in comparison to those “ super-apostles , ” even though I am nothing .
47012012	Indeed , the signs of an apostle were performed among you with great perseverance by signs and wonders and powerful deeds .
47012013	For how were you treated worse than the other churches , except that I myself was not a burden to you ? Forgive me this injustice !
47012014	Look , for the third time I am ready to come to you , and I will not be a burden to you , because I do not want your possessions , but you . For children should not have to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
47012015	Now I will most gladly spend and be spent for your lives ! If I love you more , am I to be loved less ?
47012016	But be that as it may , I have not burdened you . Yet because I was a crafty person , I took you in by deceit !
47012017	I have not taken advantage of you through anyone I have sent to you , have I ?
47012018	I urged Titus to visit you and I sent our brother along with him . Titus did not take advantage of you , did he ? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit ? Did we not behave in the same way ?
47012019	Have you been thinking all this time that we have been defending ourselves to you ? We are speaking in Christ before God , and everything we do , dear friends , is to build you up .
47012020	For I am afraid that somehow when I come I will not find you what I wish , and you will find me not what you wish . I am afraid that somehow there may be quarreling , jealousy , intense anger , selfish ambition , slander , gossip , arrogance , and disorder .
47012021	I am afraid that when I come again , my God may humiliate me before you , and I will grieve for many of those who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity , sexual immorality , and licentiousness that they have practiced .
47013001	This is the third time I am coming to visit you . By the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter will be established .
47013002	I said before when I was present the second time and now , though absent , I say again to those who sinned previously and to all the rest , that if I come again , I will not spare anyone ,
47013003	since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me . He is not weak toward you but is powerful among you .
47013004	For indeed he was crucified by reason of weakness , but he lives because of God’s power . For we also are weak in him , but we will live together with him , because of God’s power toward you .
47013005	Put yourselves to the test to see if you are in the faith ; examine yourselves ! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you – unless , indeed , you fail the test !
47013006	And I hope that you will realize that we have not failed the test !
47013007	Now we pray to God that you may not do anything wrong , not so that we may appear to have passed the test , but so that you may do what is right even if we may appear to have failed the test .
47013008	For we cannot do anything against the truth , but only for the sake of the truth .
47013009	For we rejoice whenever we are weak , but you are strong . And we pray for this : that you may become fully qualified .
47013010	Because of this I am writing these things while absent , so that when I arrive I may not have to deal harshly with you by using my authority – the Lord gave it to me for building up , not for tearing down !
47013011	Finally , brothers and sisters , rejoice , set things right , be encouraged , agree with one another , live in peace , and the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the saints greet you .
47013013	
47013014	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	From Paul , an apostle ( not from men , nor by human agency , but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead )
48001002	and all the brothers with me , to the churches of Galatia .
48001003	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father ,
48001005	to whom be glory forever and ever ! Amen .
48001006	I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are following a different gospel –
48001007	not that there really is another gospel , but there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ .
48001008	But even if we ( or an angel from heaven ) should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you , let him be condemned to hell !
48001009	As we have said before , and now I say again , if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received , let him be condemned to hell !
48001010	Am I now trying to gain the approval of people , or of God ? Or am I trying to please people ? If I were still trying to please people , I would not be a slave of Christ !
48001011	Now I want you to know , brothers and sisters , that the gospel I preached is not of human origin .
48001012	For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source ; instead I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ .
48001013	For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism , how I was savagely persecuting the church of God and trying to destroy it .
48001014	I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation , and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors .
48001015	But when the one who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased
48001016	to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach him among the Gentiles , I did not go to ask advice from any human being ,
48001017	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me , but right away I departed to Arabia , and then returned to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and get information from him , and I stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord’s brother .
48001020	I assure you that , before God , I am not lying about what I am writing to you !
48001021	Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ .
48001023	They were only hearing , “ The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy . ”
48001024	So they glorified God because of me .
48002001	Then after fourteen years I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas , taking Titus along too .
48002002	I went there because of a revelation and presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles . But I did so only in a private meeting with the influential people , to make sure that I was not running – or had not run – in vain .
48002003	Yet not even Titus , who was with me , was compelled to be circumcised , although he was a Greek .
48002004	Now this matter arose because of the false brothers with false pretenses who slipped in unnoticed to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus , to make us slaves .
48002005	But we did not surrender to them even for a moment , in order that the truth of the gospel would remain with you .
48002006	But from those who were influential ( whatever they were makes no difference to me ; God shows no favoritism between people ) – those influential leaders added nothing to my message .
48002007	On the contrary , when they saw that I was entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised just as Peter was to the circumcised
48002008	( for he who empowered Peter for his apostleship to the circumcised also empowered me for my apostleship to the Gentiles )
48002009	and when James , Cephas , and John , who had a reputation as pillars , recognized the grace that had been given to me , they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship , agreeing that we would go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised .
48002010	They requested only that we remember the poor , the very thing I also was eager to do .
48002011	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he had clearly done wrong .
48002012	Until certain people came from James , he had been eating with the Gentiles . But when they arrived , he stopped doing this and separated himself because he was afraid of those who were pro-circumcision .
48002013	And the rest of the Jews also joined with him in this hypocrisy , so that even Barnabas was led astray with them by their hypocrisy .
48002014	But when I saw that they were not behaving consistently with the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in front of them all , “ If you , although you are a Jew , live like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you try to force the Gentiles to live like Jews ? ”
48002015	We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners ,
48002016	yet we know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ . And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus , so that we may be justified by the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the law , because by the works of the law no one will be justified .
48002017	But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves have also been found to be sinners , is Christ then one who encourages sin ? Absolutely not !
48002018	But if I build up again those things I once destroyed , I demonstrate that I am one who breaks God’s law .
48002019	For through the law I died to the law so that I may live to God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ , and it is no longer I who live , but Christ lives in me . So the life I now live in the body , I live because of the faithfulness of the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me .
48002021	I do not set aside God’s grace , because if righteousness could come through the law , then Christ died for nothing !
48003001	You foolish Galatians ! Who has cast a spell on you ? Before your eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified !
48003002	The only thing I want to learn from you is this : Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? Although you began with the Spirit , are you now trying to finish by human effort ?
48003004	Have you suffered so many things for nothing ? – if indeed it was for nothing .
48003005	Does God then give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard ?
48003006	Just as Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness ,
48003007	so then , understand that those who believe are the sons of Abraham .
48003008	And the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , proclaimed the gospel to Abraham ahead of time , saying , “ All the nations will be blessed in you . ”
48003009	So then those who believe are blessed along with Abraham the believer .
48003010	For all who rely on doing the works of the law are under a curse , because it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing everything written in the book of the law . ”
48003011	Now it is clear no one is justified before God by the law , because the righteous one will live by faith .
48003012	But the law is not based on faith , but the one who does the works of the law will live by them .
48003013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us ( because it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree ” )
48003014	in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles , so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit by faith .
48003015	Brothers and sisters , I offer an example from everyday life : When a covenant has been ratified , even though it is only a human contract , no one can set it aside or add anything to it .
48003016	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant . Scripture does not say , “ and to the descendants , ” referring to many , but “ and to your descendant , ” referring to one , who is Christ .
48003017	What I am saying is this : The law that came four hundred thirty years later does not cancel a covenant previously ratified by God , so as to invalidate the promise .
48003018	For if the inheritance is based on the law , it is no longer based on the promise , but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise .
48003019	Why then was the law given ? It was added because of transgressions , until the arrival of the descendant to whom the promise had been made . It was administered through angels by an intermediary .
48003020	Now an intermediary is not for one party alone , but God is one .
48003021	Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God ? Absolutely not ! For if a law had been given that was able to give life , then righteousness would certainly have come by the law .
48003022	But the scripture imprisoned everything and everyone under sin so that the promise could be given – because of the faithfulness of Jesus Christ – to those who believe .
48003023	Now before faith came we were held in custody under the law , being kept as prisoners until the coming faith would be revealed .
48003024	Thus the law had become our guardian until Christ , so that we could be declared righteous by faith .
48003025	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a guardian .
48003026	For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith .
48003027	For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is neither male nor female – for all of you are one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	And if you belong to Christ , then you are Abraham’s descendants , heirs according to the promise .
48004001	Now I mean that the heir , as long as he is a minor , is no different from a slave , though he is the owner of everything .
48004002	But he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father .
48004003	So also we , when we were minors , were enslaved under the basic forces of the world .
48004004	But when the appropriate time had come , God sent out his Son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
48004005	to redeem those who were under the law , so that we may be adopted as sons with full rights .
48004006	And because you are sons , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , who calls “ Abba ! Father ! ”
48004007	So you are no longer a slave but a son , and if you are a son , then you are also an heir through God .
48004008	Formerly when you did not know God , you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods at all .
48004009	But now that you have come to know God ( or rather to be known by God ) , how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless basic forces ? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again ?
48004010	You are observing religious days and months and seasons and years .
48004011	I fear for you that my work for you may have been in vain .
48004012	I beg you , brothers and sisters , become like me , because I have become like you . You have done me no wrong !
48004013	But you know it was because of a physical illness that I first proclaimed the gospel to you ,
48004014	and though my physical condition put you to the test , you did not despise or reject me . Instead , you welcomed me as though I were an angel of God , as though I were Christ Jesus himself !
48004015	Where then is your sense of happiness now ? For I testify about you that if it were possible , you would have pulled out your eyes and given them to me !
48004016	So then , have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	They court you eagerly , but for no good purpose ; they want to exclude you , so that you would seek them eagerly .
48004018	However , it is good to be sought eagerly for a good purpose at all times , and not only when I am present with you .
48004019	My children – I am again undergoing birth pains until Christ is formed in you !
48004020	I wish I could be with you now and change my tone of voice , because I am perplexed about you .
48004021	Tell me , you who want to be under the law , do you not understand the law ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman .
48004023	But one , the son by the slave woman , was born by natural descent , while the other , the son by the free woman , was born through the promise .
48004024	These things may be treated as an allegory , for these women represent two covenants . One is from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery ; this is Hagar .
48004025	Now Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem above is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written : “ Rejoice , O barren woman who does not bear children ; break forth and shout , you who have no birth pains , because the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband . ”
48004028	But you , brothers and sisters , are children of the promise like Isaac .
48004029	But just as at that time the one born by natural descent persecuted the one born according to the Spirit , so it is now .
48004030	But what does the scripture say ? “ Throw out the slave woman and her son , for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the son ” of the free woman .
48004031	Therefore , brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman .
48005001	For freedom Christ has set us free . Stand firm , then , and do not be subject again to the yoke of slavery .
48005002	Listen ! I , Paul , tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised , Christ will be of no benefit to you at all !
48005003	And I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law .
48005004	You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ ; you have fallen away from grace !
48005005	For through the Spirit , by faith , we wait expectantly for the hope of righteousness .
48005006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision carries any weight – the only thing that matters is faith working through love .
48005007	You were running well ; who prevented you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you !
48005009	A little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise !
48005010	I am confident in the Lord that you will accept no other view . But the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty , whoever he may be .
48005011	Now , brothers and sisters , if I am still preaching circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed .
48005012	I wish those agitators would go so far as to castrate themselves !
48005013	For you were called to freedom , brothers and sisters ; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity to indulge your flesh , but through love serve one another .
48005014	For the whole law can be summed up in a single commandment , namely , “ You must love your neighbor as yourself . ”
48005015	However , if you continually bite and devour one another , beware that you are not consumed by one another .
48005016	But I say , live by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh has desires that are opposed to the Spirit , and the Spirit has desires that are opposed to the flesh , for these are in opposition to each other , so that you cannot do what you want .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
48005019	Now the works of the flesh are obvious : sexual immorality , impurity , depravity ,
48005020	idolatry , sorcery , hostilities , strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , selfish rivalries , dissensions , factions ,
48005021	envying , murder , drunkenness , carousing , and similar things . I am warning you , as I had warned you before : Those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God !
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness , and self-control . Against such things there is no law .
48005024	Now those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
48005025	If we live by the Spirit , let us also behave in accordance with the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become conceited , provoking one another , being jealous of one another .
48006001	Brothers and sisters , if a person is discovered in some sin , you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness . Pay close attention to yourselves , so that you are not tempted too .
48006002	Carry one another’s burdens , and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
48006004	Let each one examine his own work . Then he can take pride in himself and not compare himself with someone else .
48006005	For each one will carry his own load .
48006006	Now the one who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with the one who teaches it .
48006007	Do not be deceived . God will not be made a fool . For a person will reap what he sows ,
48006008	because the person who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh , but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit .
48006009	So we must not grow weary in doing good , for in due time we will reap , if we do not give up .
48006010	So then , whenever we have an opportunity , let us do good to all people , and especially to those who belong to the family of faith .
48006011	See what big letters I make as I write to you with my own hand !
48006012	Those who want to make a good showing in external matters are trying to force you to be circumcised . They do so only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48006013	For those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves , but they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh .
48006014	But may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
48006015	For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything ; the only thing that matters is a new creation !
48006016	And all who will behave in accordance with this rule , peace and mercy be on them , and on the Israel of God .
48006017	From now on let no one cause me trouble , for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers and sisters . Amen .
49001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , to the saints [ in Ephesus ] , the faithful in Christ Jesus .
49001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
49001003	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ .
49001004	For he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we may be holy and unblemished in his sight in love .
49001005	He did this by predestining us to adoption as his sons through Jesus Christ , according to the pleasure of his will –
49001006	to the praise of the glory of his grace that he has freely bestowed on us in his dearly loved Son .
49001007	In him we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace
49001008	that he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight .
49001009	He did this when he revealed to us the secret of his will , according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ ,
49001010	toward the administration of the fullness of the times , to head up all things in Christ – the things in heaven and the things on earth .
49001011	In Christ we too have been claimed as God’s own possession , since we were predestined according to the one purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will
49001012	so that we , who were the first to set our hope on Christ , would be to the praise of his glory .
49001013	And when you heard the word of truth ( the gospel of your salvation ) – when you believed in Christ – you were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit ,
49001014	who is the down payment of our inheritance , until the redemption of God’s own possession , to the praise of his glory .
49001015	For this reason , because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints ,
49001016	I do not cease to give thanks for you when I remember you in my prayers .
49001017	I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give you spiritual wisdom and revelation in your growing knowledge of him ,
49001018	– since the eyes of your heart have been enlightened – so that you may know what is the hope of his calling , what is the wealth of his glorious inheritance in the saints ,
49001019	and what is the incomparable greatness of his power toward us who believe , as displayed in the exercise of his immense strength .
49001020	This power he exercised in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms
49001021	far above every rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named , not only in this age but also in the one to come .
49001022	And God put all things under Christ’s feet , and he gave him to the church as head over all things .
49001023	Now the church is his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all .
49002001	And although you were dead in your transgressions and sins ,
49002002	in which you formerly lived according to this world’s present path , according to the ruler of the kingdom of the air , the ruler of the spirit that is now energizing the sons of disobedience ,
49002003	among whom all of us also formerly lived out our lives in the cravings of our flesh , indulging the desires of the flesh and the mind , and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest …
49002004	But God , being rich in mercy , because of his great love with which he loved us ,
49002005	even though we were dead in transgressions , made us alive together with Christ – by grace you are saved ! –
49002006	and he raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus ,
49002007	to demonstrate in the coming ages the surpassing wealth of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For by grace you are saved through faith , and this is not from yourselves , it is the gift of God ;
49002009	it is not from works , so that no one can boast .
49002010	For we are his workmanship , having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them .
49002011	Therefore remember that formerly you , the Gentiles in the flesh – who are called “ uncircumcision ” by the so-called “ circumcision ” that is performed on the body by human hands –
49002012	that you were at that time without the Messiah , alienated from the citizenship of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who used to be far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he is our peace , the one who made both groups into one and who destroyed the middle wall of partition , the hostility ,
49002015	when he nullified in his flesh the law of commandments in decrees . He did this to create in himself one new man out of two , thus making peace ,
49002016	and to reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross , by which the hostility has been killed .
49002017	And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near ,
49002018	so that through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father .
49002019	So then you are no longer foreigners and noncitizens , but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household ,
49002020	because you have been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone .
49002021	In him the whole building , being joined together , grows into a holy temple in the Lord ,
49002022	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit .
49003001	For this reason I , Paul , the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles –
49003002	if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you ,
49003003	that by revelation the divine secret was made known to me , as I wrote before briefly .
49003004	When reading this , you will be able to understand my insight into this secret of Christ .
49003005	Now this secret was not disclosed to people in former generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ,
49003006	namely , that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs , fellow members of the body , and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus .
49003007	I became a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the exercise of his power .
49003008	To me – less than the least of all the saints – this grace was given , to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ
49003009	and to enlighten everyone about God’s secret plan – a secret that has been hidden for ages in God who has created all things .
49003010	The purpose of this enlightenment is that through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God should now be disclosed to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms .
49003011	This was according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
49003012	in whom we have boldness and confident access to God because of Christ’s faithfulness .
49003013	For this reason I ask you not to lose heart because of what I am suffering for you , which is your glory .
49003014	For this reason I kneel before the Father ,
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on the earth is named .
49003016	I pray that according to the wealth of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person ,
49003017	that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith , so that , because you have been rooted and grounded in love ,
49003018	you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth ,
49003019	and thus to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge , so that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God .
49003020	Now to him who by the power that is working within us is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think ,
49003021	to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations , forever and ever . Amen .
49004001	I , therefore , the prisoner for the Lord , urge you to live worthily of the calling with which you have been called ,
49004002	with all humility and gentleness , with patience , bearing with one another in love ,
49004003	making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit , just as you too were called to the one hope of your calling ,
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
49004007	But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
49004008	Therefore it says , “ When he ascended on high he captured captives ; he gave gifts to men . ”
49004009	Now what is the meaning of “ he ascended , ” except that he also descended to the lower regions , namely , the earth ?
49004010	He , the very one who descended , is also the one who ascended above all the heavens , in order to fill all things .
49004011	It was he who gave some as apostles , some as prophets , some as evangelists , and some as pastors and teachers ,
49004012	to equip the saints for the work of ministry , that is , to build up the body of Christ ,
49004013	until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God – a mature person , attaining to the measure of Christ’s full stature .
49004014	So we are no longer to be children , tossed back and forth by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching by the trickery of people who craftily carry out their deceitful schemes .
49004015	But practicing the truth in love , we will in all things grow up into Christ , who is the head .
49004016	From him the whole body grows , fitted and held together through every supporting ligament . As each one does its part , the body grows in love .
49004017	So I say this , and insist in the Lord , that you no longer live as the Gentiles do , in the futility of their thinking .
49004018	They are darkened in their understanding , being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts .
49004019	Because they are callous , they have given themselves over to indecency for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness .
49004020	But you did not learn about Christ like this ,
49004021	if indeed you heard about him and were taught in him , just as the truth is in Jesus .
49004022	You were taught with reference to your former way of life to lay aside the old man who is being corrupted in accordance with deceitful desires ,
49004023	to be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
49004024	and to put on the new man who has been created in God’s image – in righteousness and holiness that comes from truth .
49004025	Therefore , having laid aside falsehood , each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor , for we are members of one another .
49004026	Be angry and do not sin ; do not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger .
49004027	Do not give the devil an opportunity .
49004028	The one who steals must steal no longer ; rather he must labor , doing good with his own hands , so that he may have something to share with the one who has need .
49004029	You must let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth , but only what is beneficial for the building up of the one in need , that it may give grace to those who hear .
49004030	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	You must put away every kind of bitterness , anger , wrath , quarreling , and evil , slanderous talk .
49004032	Instead , be kind to one another , compassionate , forgiving one another , just as God in Christ also forgave you .
49005001	Therefore , be imitators of God as dearly loved children
49005002	and live in love , just as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us , a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God .
49005003	But among you there must not be either sexual immorality , impurity of any kind , or greed , as these are not fitting for the saints .
49005004	Neither should there be vulgar speech , foolish talk , or coarse jesting – all of which are out of character – but rather thanksgiving .
49005005	For you can be confident of this one thing : that no person who is immoral , impure , or greedy ( such a person is an idolater ) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
49005006	Let nobody deceive you with empty words , for because of these things God’s wrath comes on the sons of disobedience .
49005007	Therefore do not be partakers with them ,
49005008	for you were at one time darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Walk as children of the light –
49005009	for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness , righteousness , and truth –
49005010	trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord .
49005011	Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness , but rather expose them .
49005012	For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention .
49005013	But all things being exposed by the light are made evident .
49005014	For everything made evident is light , and for this reason it says : “ Awake , O sleeper ! Rise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you ! ”
49005015	Therefore be very careful how you live – not as unwise but as wise ,
49005016	taking advantage of every opportunity , because the days are evil .
49005017	For this reason do not be foolish , but be wise by understanding what the Lord’s will is .
49005018	And do not get drunk with wine , which is debauchery , but be filled by the Spirit ,
49005019	speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord ,
49005020	always giving thanks to God the Father for each other in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
49005021	and submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ .
49005022	Wives , submit to your husbands as to the Lord ,
49005023	because the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church – he himself being the savior of the body .
49005024	But as the church submits to Christ , so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her
49005026	to sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of the water by the word ,
49005027	so that he may present the church to himself as glorious – not having a stain or wrinkle , or any such blemish , but holy and blameless .
49005028	In the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	For no one has ever hated his own body but he feeds it and takes care of it , just as Christ also does the church ,
49005030	for we are members of his body .
49005031	For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife , and the two will become one flesh .
49005032	This mystery is great – but I am actually speaking with reference to Christ and the church .
49005033	Nevertheless , each one of you must also love his own wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord for this is right .
49006002	“ Honor your father and mother , ” which is the first commandment accompanied by a promise , namely ,
49006003	“ that it may go well with you and that you will live a long time on the earth . ”
49006004	Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but raise them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , obey your human masters with fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart as to Christ ,
49006006	not like those who do their work only when someone is watching – as people-pleasers – but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the heart .
49006007	Obey with enthusiasm , as though serving the Lord and not people ,
49006008	because you know that each person , whether slave or free , if he does something good , this will be rewarded by the Lord .
49006009	Masters , treat your slaves the same way , giving up the use of threats , because you know that both you and they have the same master in heaven , and there is no favoritism with him .
49006010	Finally , be strengthened in the Lord and in the strength of his power .
49006011	Clothe yourselves with the full armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil .
49006012	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the powers , against the world rulers of this darkness , against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens .
49006013	For this reason , take up the full armor of God so that you may be able to stand your ground on the evil day , and having done everything , to stand .
49006014	Stand firm therefore , by fastening the belt of truth around your waist , by putting on the breastplate of righteousness ,
49006015	by fitting your feet with the preparation that comes from the good news of peace ,
49006016	and in all of this , by taking up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
49006017	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
49006018	With every prayer and petition , pray at all times in the Spirit , and to this end be alert , with all perseverance and requests for all the saints .
49006019	Pray for me also , that I may be given the message when I begin to speak – that I may confidently make known the mystery of the gospel ,
49006020	for which I am an ambassador in chains . Pray that I may be able to speak boldly as I ought to speak .
49006021	Tychicus , my dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make everything known to you , so that you too may know about my circumstances , how I am doing .
49006022	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts .
49006023	Peace to the brothers and sisters , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	Grace be with all of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love .
50001001	From Paul and Timothy , slaves of Christ Jesus , to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , with the overseers and deacons .
50001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
50001003	I thank my God every time I remember you .
50001004	I always pray with joy in my every prayer for all of you
50001005	because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now .
50001006	For I am sure of this very thing , that the one who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus .
50001007	For it is right for me to think this about all of you , because I have you in my heart , since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you became partners in God’s grace together with me .
50001008	For God is my witness that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus .
50001009	And I pray this , that your love may abound even more and more in knowledge and every kind of insight
50001010	so that you can decide what is best , and thus be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ ,
50001011	filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	I want you to know , brothers and sisters , that my situation has actually turned out to advance the gospel :
50001013	The whole imperial guard and everyone else knows that I am in prison for the sake of Christ ,
50001014	and most of the brothers and sisters , having confidence in the Lord because of my imprisonment , now more than ever dare to speak the word fearlessly .
50001015	Some , to be sure , are preaching Christ from envy and rivalry , but others from goodwill .
50001016	The latter do so from love because they know that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel .
50001017	The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition , not sincerely , because they think they can cause trouble for me in my imprisonment .
50001018	What is the result ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is being proclaimed , and in this I rejoice . Yes , and I will continue to rejoice ,
50001019	for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ .
50001020	My confident hope is that I will in no way be ashamed but that with complete boldness , even now as always , Christ will be exalted in my body , whether I live or die .
50001021	For to me , living is Christ and dying is gain .
50001022	Now if I am to go on living in the body , this will mean productive work for me , yet I don’t know which I prefer :
50001023	I feel torn between the two , because I have a desire to depart and be with Christ , which is better by far ,
50001024	but it is more vital for your sake that I remain in the body .
50001025	And since I am sure of this , I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith ,
50001026	so that what you can be proud of may increase because of me in Christ Jesus , when I come back to you .
50001027	Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that – whether I come and see you or whether I remain absent – I should hear that you are standing firm in one spirit , with one mind , by contending side by side for the faith of the gospel ,
50001028	and by not being intimidated in any way by your opponents . This is a sign of their destruction , but of your salvation – a sign which is from God .
50001029	For it has been granted to you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for him ,
50001030	since you are encountering the same conflict that you saw me face and now hear that I am facing .
50002001	Therefore , if there is any encouragement in Christ , any comfort provided by love , any fellowship in the Spirit , any affection or mercy ,
50002002	complete my joy and be of the same mind , by having the same love , being united in spirit , and having one purpose .
50002003	Instead of being motivated by selfish ambition or vanity , each of you should , in humility , be moved to treat one another as more important than yourself .
50002004	Each of you should be concerned not only about your own interests , but about the interests of others as well .
50002005	You should have the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had ,
50002006	who though he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God as something to be grasped ,
50002007	but emptied himself by taking on the form of a slave , by looking like other men , and by sharing in human nature .
50002008	He humbled himself , by becoming obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross !
50002009	As a result God exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name ,
50002010	so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow – in heaven and on earth and under the earth –
50002011	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	So then , my dear friends , just as you have always obeyed , not only in my presence but even more in my absence , continue working out your salvation with awe and reverence ,
50002013	for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort – for the sake of his good pleasure – is God .
50002014	Do everything without grumbling or arguing ,
50002015	so that you may be blameless and pure , children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society , in which you shine as lights in the world
50002016	by holding on to the word of life so that on the day of Christ I will have a reason to boast that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain .
50002017	But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I am glad and rejoice together with all of you .
50002018	And in the same way you also should be glad and rejoice together with me .
50002019	Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , so that I too may be encouraged by hearing news about you .
50002020	For there is no one here like him who will readily demonstrate his deep concern for you .
50002021	Others are busy with their own concerns , not those of Jesus Christ .
50002022	But you know his qualifications , that like a son working with his father , he served with me in advancing the gospel .
50002023	So I hope to send him as soon as I know more about my situation ,
50002024	though I am confident in the Lord that I too will be coming to see you soon .
50002025	But for now I have considered it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you . For he is my brother , coworker and fellow soldier , and your messenger and minister to me in my need .
50002026	Indeed , he greatly missed all of you and was distressed because you heard that he had been ill .
50002027	In fact he became so ill that he nearly died . But God showed mercy to him – and not to him only , but also to me – so that I would not have grief on top of grief .
50002028	Therefore I am all the more eager to send him , so that when you see him again you can rejoice and I can be free from anxiety .
50002029	So welcome him in the Lord with great joy , and honor people like him ,
50002030	since it was because of the work of Christ that he almost died . He risked his life so that he could make up for your inability to serve me .
50003001	Finally , my brothers and sisters , rejoice in the Lord ! To write this again is no trouble to me , and it is a safeguard for you .
50003002	Beware of the dogs , beware of the evil workers , beware of those who mutilate the flesh !
50003003	For we are the circumcision , the ones who worship by the Spirit of God , exult in Christ Jesus , and do not rely on human credentials
50003004	– though mine too are significant . If someone thinks he has good reasons to put confidence in human credentials , I have more :
50003005	I was circumcised on the eighth day , from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews . I lived according to the law as a Pharisee .
50003006	In my zeal for God I persecuted the church . According to the righteousness stipulated in the law I was blameless .
50003007	But these assets I have come to regard as liabilities because of Christ .
50003008	More than that , I now regard all things as liabilities compared to the far greater value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord , for whom I have suffered the loss of all things – indeed , I regard them as dung ! – that I may gain Christ ,
50003009	and be found in him , not because I have my own righteousness derived from the law , but because I have the righteousness that comes by way of Christ’s faithfulness – a righteousness from God that is in fact based on Christ’s faithfulness .
50003010	My aim is to know him , to experience the power of his resurrection , to share in his sufferings , and to be like him in his death ,
50003011	and so , somehow , to attain to the resurrection from the dead .
50003012	Not that I have already attained this – that is , I have not already been perfected – but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus also laid hold of me .
50003013	Brothers and sisters , I do not consider myself to have attained this . Instead I am single-minded : Forgetting the things that are behind and reaching out for the things that are ahead ,
50003014	with this goal in mind , I strive toward the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Therefore let those of us who are “ perfect ” embrace this point of view . If you think otherwise , God will reveal to you the error of your ways .
50003016	Nevertheless , let us live up to the standard that we have already attained .
50003017	Be imitators of me , brothers and sisters , and watch carefully those who are living this way , just as you have us as an example .
50003018	For many live , about whom I have often told you , and now , with tears , I tell you that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	Their end is destruction , their god is the belly , they exult in their shame , and they think about earthly things .
50003020	But our citizenship is in heaven – and we also await a savior from there , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
50003021	who will transform these humble bodies of ours into the likeness of his glorious body by means of that power by which he is able to subject all things to himself .
50004001	So then , my brothers and sisters , dear friends whom I long to see , my joy and crown , stand in the Lord in this way , my dear friends !
50004002	I appeal to Euodia and to Syntyche to agree in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , I say also to you , true companion , help them . They have struggled together in the gospel ministry along with me and Clement and my other coworkers , whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always . Again I say , rejoice !
50004005	Let everyone see your gentleness . The Lord is near !
50004006	Do not be anxious about anything . Instead , in every situation , through prayer and petition with thanksgiving , tell your requests to God .
50004007	And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Finally , brothers and sisters , whatever is true , whatever is worthy of respect , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is commendable , if something is excellent or praiseworthy , think about these things .
50004009	And what you learned and received and heard and saw in me , do these things . And the God of peace will be with you .
50004010	I have great joy in the Lord because now at last you have again expressed your concern for me . ( Now I know you were concerned before but had no opportunity to do anything . )
50004011	I am not saying this because I am in need , for I have learned to be content in any circumstance .
50004012	I have experienced times of need and times of abundance . In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment , whether I go satisfied or hungry , have plenty or nothing .
50004013	I am able to do all things through the one who strengthens me .
50004014	Nevertheless , you did well to share with me in my trouble .
50004015	And as you Philippians know , at the beginning of my gospel ministry , when I left Macedonia , no church shared with me in this matter of giving and receiving except you alone .
50004016	For even in Thessalonica on more than one occasion you sent something for my need .
50004017	I do not say this because I am seeking a gift . Rather , I seek the credit that abounds to your account .
50004018	For I have received everything , and I have plenty . I have all I need because I received from Epaphroditus what you sent – a fragrant offering , an acceptable sacrifice , very pleasing to God .
50004019	And my God will supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus .
50004020	May glory be given to God our Father forever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Give greetings to all the saints in Christ Jesus . The brothers with me here send greetings .
50004022	All the saints greet you , especially those who belong to Caesar’s household .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
51001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	to the saints , the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ , at Colossae . Grace and peace to you from God our Father !
51001003	We always give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you ,
51001004	since we heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints .
51001005	Your faith and love have arisen from the hope laid up for you in heaven , which you have heard about in the message of truth , the gospel
51001006	that has come to you . Just as in the entire world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing , so it has also been bearing fruit and growing among you from the first day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth .
51001007	You learned the gospel from Epaphras , our dear fellow slave – a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf –
51001008	who also told us of your love in the Spirit .
51001009	For this reason we also , from the day we heard about you , have not ceased praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
51001010	so that you may live worthily of the Lord and please him in all respects – bearing fruit in every good deed , growing in the knowledge of God ,
51001011	being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might for the display of all patience and steadfastness , joyfully
51001012	giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light .
51001013	He delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son he loves ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins .
51001015	He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn over all creation ,
51001016	for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him – all things , whether visible or invisible , whether thrones or dominions , whether principalities or powers – all things were created through him and for him .
51001017	He himself is before all things and all things are held together in him .
51001018	He is the head of the body , the church , as well as the beginning , the firstborn from among the dead , so that he himself may become first in all things .
51001019	For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in the Son
51001020	and through him to reconcile all things to himself by making peace through the blood of his cross – through him , whether things on earth or things in heaven .
51001021	And you were at one time strangers and enemies in your minds as expressed through your evil deeds ,
51001022	but now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy , without blemish , and blameless before him –
51001023	if indeed you remain in the faith , established and firm , without shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard . This gospel has also been preached in all creation under heaven , and I , Paul , have become its servant .
51001024	Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you , and I fill up in my physical body – for the sake of his body , the church – what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ .
51001025	I became a servant of the church according to the stewardship from God – given to me for you – in order to complete the word of God ,
51001026	that is , the mystery that has been kept hidden from ages and generations , but has now been revealed to his saints .
51001027	God wanted to make known to them the glorious riches of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory .
51001028	We proclaim him by instructing and teaching all people with all wisdom so that we may present every person mature in Christ .
51001029	Toward this goal I also labor , struggling according to his power that powerfully works in me .
51002001	For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for those who have not met me face to face .
51002002	My goal is that their hearts , having been knit together in love , may be encouraged , and that they may have all the riches that assurance brings in their understanding of the knowledge of the mystery of God , namely , Christ ,
51002003	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	I say this so that no one will deceive you through arguments that sound reasonable .
51002005	For though I am absent from you in body , I am present with you in spirit , rejoicing to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in Christ .
51002006	Therefore , just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord , continue to live your lives in him ,
51002007	rooted and built up in him and firm in your faith just as you were taught , and overflowing with thankfulness .
51002008	Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you through an empty , deceitful philosophy that is according to human traditions and the elemental spirits of the world , and not according to Christ .
51002009	For in him all the fullness of deity lives in bodily form ,
51002010	and you have been filled in him , who is the head over every ruler and authority .
51002011	In him you also were circumcised – not , however , with a circumcision performed by human hands , but by the removal of the fleshly body , that is , through the circumcision done by Christ .
51002012	Having been buried with him in baptism , you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead .
51002013	And even though you were dead in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your flesh , he nevertheless made you alive with him , having forgiven all your transgressions .
51002014	He has destroyed what was against us , a certificate of indebtedness expressed in decrees opposed to us . He has taken it away by nailing it to the cross .
51002015	Disarming the rulers and authorities , he has made a public disgrace of them , triumphing over them by the cross .
51002016	Therefore do not let anyone judge you with respect to food or drink , or in the matter of a feast , new moon , or Sabbath days –
51002017	these are only the shadow of the things to come , but the reality is Christ !
51002018	Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels pass judgment on you . That person goes on at great lengths about what he has supposedly seen , but he is puffed up with empty notions by his fleshly mind .
51002019	He has not held fast to the head from whom the whole body , supported and knit together through its ligaments and sinews , grows with a growth that is from God .
51002020	If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world , why do you submit to them as though you lived in the world ?
51002021	“ Do not handle ! Do not taste ! Do not touch ! ”
51002022	These are all destined to perish with use , founded as they are on human commands and teachings .
51002023	Even though they have the appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship and false humility achieved by an unsparing treatment of the body – a wisdom with no true value – they in reality result in fleshly indulgence .
51003001	Therefore , if you have been raised with Christ , keep seeking the things above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God .
51003002	Keep thinking about things above , not things on the earth ,
51003003	for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ ( who is your life ) appears , then you too will be revealed in glory with him .
51003005	So put to death whatever in your nature belongs to the earth : sexual immorality , impurity , shameful passion , evil desire , and greed which is idolatry .
51003006	Because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience .
51003007	You also lived your lives in this way at one time , when you used to live among them .
51003008	But now , put off all such things as anger , rage , malice , slander , abusive language from your mouth .
51003009	Do not lie to one another since you have put off the old man with its practices
51003010	and have been clothed with the new man that is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it .
51003011	Here there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcised or uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave or free , but Christ is all and in all .
51003012	Therefore , as the elect of God , holy and dearly loved , clothe yourselves with a heart of mercy , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience ,
51003013	bearing with one another and forgiving one another , if someone happens to have a complaint against anyone else . Just as the Lord has forgiven you , so you also forgive others .
51003014	And to all these virtues add love , which is the perfect bond .
51003015	Let the peace of Christ be in control in your heart ( for you were in fact called as one body to this peace ) , and be thankful .
51003016	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly , teaching and exhorting one another with all wisdom , singing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , all with grace in your hearts to God .
51003017	And whatever you do in word or deed , do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , submit to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not be embittered against them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this is pleasing in the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not provoke your children , so they will not become disheartened .
51003022	Slaves , obey your earthly masters in every respect , not only when they are watching – like those who are strictly people-pleasers – but with a sincere heart , fearing the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you are doing , work at it with enthusiasm , as to the Lord and not for people ,
51003024	because you know that you will receive your inheritance from the Lord as the reward . Serve the Lord Christ .
51003025	For the one who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong , and there are no exceptions .
51004001	Masters , treat your slaves with justice and fairness , because you know that you also have a master in heaven .
51004002	Be devoted to prayer , keeping alert in it with thanksgiving .
51004003	At the same time pray for us too , that God may open a door for the message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ , for which I am in chains .
51004004	Pray that I may make it known as I should .
51004005	Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders , making the most of the opportunities .
51004006	Let your speech always be gracious , seasoned with salt , so that you may know how you should answer everyone .
51004007	Tychicus , a dear brother , faithful minister , and fellow slave in the Lord , will tell you all the news about me .
51004008	I sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts .
51004009	I sent him with Onesimus , the faithful and dear brother , who is one of you . They will tell you about everything here .
51004010	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , sends you greetings , as does Mark , the cousin of Barnabas ( about whom you received instructions ; if he comes to you , welcome him ) .
51004011	And Jesus who is called Justus also sends greetings . In terms of Jewish converts , these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God , and they have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of you and a slave of Christ , greets you . He is always struggling in prayer on your behalf , so that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God .
51004013	For I can testify that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Our dear friend Luke the physician and Demas greet you .
51004015	Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters who are in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house .
51004016	And after you have read this letter , have it read to the church of Laodicea . In turn , read the letter from Laodicea as well .
51004017	And tell Archippus , “ See to it that you complete the ministry you received in the Lord . ”
51004018	I , Paul , write this greeting by my own hand . Remember my chains . Grace be with you .
52001001	From Paul and Silvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Grace and peace to you !
52001002	We thank God always for all of you as we mention you constantly in our prayers ,
52001003	because we recall in the presence of our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
52001004	We know , brothers and sisters loved by God , that he has chosen you ,
52001005	in that our gospel did not come to you merely in words , but in power and in the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction ( surely you recall the character we displayed when we came among you to help you ) .
52001006	And you became imitators of us and of the Lord , when you received the message with joy that comes from the Holy Spirit , despite great affliction .
52001007	As a result you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia .
52001008	For from you the message of the Lord has echoed forth not just in Macedonia and Achaia , but in every place reports of your faith in God have spread , so that we do not need to say anything .
52001009	For people everywhere report how you welcomed us and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God
52001010	and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath .
52002001	For you yourselves know , brothers and sisters , about our coming to you – it has not proven to be purposeless .
52002002	But although we suffered earlier and were mistreated in Philippi , as you know , we had the courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of much opposition .
52002003	For the appeal we make does not come from error or impurity or with deceit ,
52002004	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel , so we declare it , not to please people but God , who examines our hearts .
52002005	For we never appeared with flattering speech , as you know , nor with a pretext for greed – God is our witness –
52002006	nor to seek glory from people , either from you or from others ,
52002007	although we could have imposed our weight as apostles of Christ ; instead we became little children among you . Like a nursing mother caring for her own children ,
52002008	with such affection for you we were happy to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives , because you had become dear to us .
52002009	For you recall , brothers and sisters , our toil and drudgery : By working night and day so as not to impose a burden on any of you , we preached to you the gospel of God .
52002010	You are witnesses , and so is God , as to how holy and righteous and blameless our conduct was toward you who believe .
52002011	As you know , we treated each one of you as a father treats his own children ,
52002012	exhorting and encouraging you and insisting that you live in a way worthy of God who calls you to his own kingdom and his glory .
52002013	And so we too constantly thank God that when you received God’s message that you heard from us , you accepted it not as a human message , but as it truly is , God’s message , which is at work among you who believe .
52002014	For you became imitators , brothers and sisters , of God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea , because you too suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they in fact did from the Jews ,
52002015	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us severely . They are displeasing to God and are opposed to all people ,
52002016	because they hinder us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved . Thus they constantly fill up their measure of sins , but wrath has come upon them completely .
52002017	But when we were separated from you , brothers and sisters , for a short time ( in presence , not in affection ) we became all the more fervent in our great desire to see you in person .
52002018	For we wanted to come to you ( I , Paul , in fact tried again and again ) but Satan thwarted us .
52002019	For who is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming ? Is it not of course you ?
52002020	For you are our glory and joy !
52003001	So when we could bear it no longer , we decided to stay on in Athens alone .
52003002	We sent Timothy , our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ , to strengthen you and encourage you about your faith ,
52003003	so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions . For you yourselves know that we are destined for this .
52003004	For in fact when we were with you , we were telling you in advance that we would suffer affliction , and so it has happened , as you well know .
52003005	So when I could bear it no longer , I sent to find out about your faith , for fear that the tempter somehow tempted you and our toil had proven useless .
52003006	But now Timothy has come to us from you and given us the good news of your faith and love and that you always think of us with affection and long to see us just as we also long to see you !
52003007	So in all our distress and affliction , we were reassured about you , brothers and sisters , through your faith .
52003008	For now we are alive again , if you stand firm in the Lord .
52003009	For how can we thank God enough for you , for all the joy we feel because of you before our God ?
52003010	We pray earnestly night and day to see you in person and make up what may be lacking in your faith .
52003011	Now may God our Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you .
52003012	And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another and for all , just as we do for you ,
52003013	so that your hearts are strengthened in holiness to be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
52004001	Finally then , brothers and sisters , we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus , that as you received instruction from us about how you must live and please God ( as you are in fact living ) that you do so more and more .
52004002	For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is God’s will : that you become holy , that you keep away from sexual immorality ,
52004004	that each of you know how to possess his own body in holiness and honor ,
52004005	not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God .
52004006	In this matter no one should violate the rights of his brother or take advantage of him , because the Lord is the avenger in all these cases , as we also told you earlier and warned you solemnly .
52004007	For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness .
52004008	Consequently the one who rejects this is not rejecting human authority but God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you .
52004009	Now on the topic of brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write you , for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another .
52004010	And indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers and sisters in all of Macedonia . But we urge you , brothers and sisters , to do so more and more ,
52004011	to aspire to lead a quiet life , to attend to your own business , and to work with your hands , as we commanded you .
52004012	In this way you will live a decent life before outsiders and not be in need .
52004013	Now we do not want you to be uninformed , brothers and sisters , about those who are asleep , so that you will not grieve like the rest who have no hope .
52004014	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , so also we believe that God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep as Christians .
52004015	For we tell you this by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will surely not go ahead of those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trumpet of God , and the dead in Christ will rise first .
52004017	Then we who are alive , who are left , will be suddenly caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And so we will always be with the Lord .
52004018	Therefore encourage one another with these words .
52005001	Now on the topic of times and seasons , brothers and sisters , you have no need for anything to be written to you .
52005002	For you know quite well that the day of the Lord will come in the same way as a thief in the night .
52005003	Now when they are saying , “ There is peace and security , ” then sudden destruction comes on them , like labor pains on a pregnant woman , and they will surely not escape .
52005004	But you , brothers and sisters , are not in the darkness for the day to overtake you like a thief would .
52005005	For you all are sons of the light and sons of the day . We are not of the night nor of the darkness .
52005006	So then we must not sleep as the rest , but must stay alert and sober .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep at night and those who get drunk are drunk at night .
52005008	But since we are of the day , we must stay sober by putting on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet our hope for salvation .
52005009	For God did not destine us for wrath but for gaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005010	He died for us so that whether we are alert or asleep we will come to life together with him .
52005011	Therefore encourage one another and build up each other , just as you are in fact doing .
52005012	Now we ask you , brothers and sisters , to acknowledge those who labor among you and preside over you in the Lord and admonish you ,
52005013	and to esteem them most highly in love because of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	And we urge you , brothers and sisters , admonish the undisciplined , comfort the discouraged , help the weak , be patient toward all .
52005015	See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone , but always pursue what is good for one another and for all .
52005016	Always rejoice ,
52005017	constantly pray ,
52005018	in everything give thanks . For this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus .
52005019	Do not extinguish the Spirit .
52005020	Do not treat prophecies with contempt .
52005021	But examine all things ; hold fast to what is good .
52005022	Stay away from every form of evil .
52005023	Now may the God of peace himself make you completely holy and may your spirit and soul and body be kept entirely blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	He who calls you is trustworthy , and he will in fact do this .
52005025	Brothers and sisters , pray for us too .
52005026	Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss .
52005027	I call on you solemnly in the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	From Paul and Silvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001002	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
53001003	We ought to thank God always for you , brothers and sisters , and rightly so , because your faith flourishes more and more and the love of each one of you all for one another is ever greater .
53001004	As a result we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you are enduring .
53001005	This is evidence of God’s righteous judgment , to make you worthy of the kingdom of God , for which in fact you are suffering .
53001006	For it is right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you ,
53001007	and to you who are being afflicted to give rest together with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels .
53001008	With flaming fire he will mete out punishment on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will undergo the penalty of eternal destruction , away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his strength ,
53001010	when he comes to be glorified among his saints and admired on that day among all who have believed – and you did in fact believe our testimony .
53001011	And in this regard we pray for you always , that our God will make you worthy of his calling and fulfill by his power your every desire for goodness and every work of faith ,
53001012	that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Now regarding the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to be with him , we ask you , brothers and sisters ,
53002002	not to be easily shaken from your composure or disturbed by any kind of spirit or message or letter allegedly from us , to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here .
53002003	Let no one deceive you in any way . For that day will not arrive until the rebellion comes and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the son of destruction .
53002004	He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship , and as a result he takes his seat in God’s temple , displaying himself as God .
53002005	Surely you recall that I used to tell you these things while I was still with you .
53002006	And so you know what holds him back , so that he will be revealed in his own time .
53002007	For the hidden power of lawlessness is already at work . However , the one who holds him back will do so until he is taken out of the way ,
53002008	and then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord will destroy by the breath of his mouth and wipe out by the manifestation of his arrival .
53002009	The arrival of the lawless one will be by Satan’s working with all kinds of miracles and signs and false wonders ,
53002010	and with every kind of evil deception directed against those who are perishing , because they found no place in their hearts for the truth so as to be saved .
53002011	Consequently God sends on them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false .
53002012	And so all of them who have not believed the truth but have delighted in evil will be condemned .
53002013	But we ought to thank God always for you , brothers and sisters loved by the Lord , because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth .
53002014	He called you to this salvation through our gospel , so that you may possess the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	Therefore , brothers and sisters , stand firm and hold on to the traditions that we taught you , whether by speech or by letter .
53002016	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father , who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope ,
53002017	encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good thing you do or say .
53003001	Finally , pray for us , brothers and sisters , that the Lord’s message may spread quickly and be honored as in fact it was among you ,
53003002	and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil people . For not all have faith .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful , and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one .
53003004	And we are confident about you in the Lord that you are both doing – and will do – what we are commanding .
53003005	Now may the Lord direct your hearts toward the love of God and the endurance of Christ .
53003006	But we command you , brothers and sisters , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to keep away from any brother who lives an undisciplined life and not according to the tradition they received from us .
53003007	For you know yourselves how you must imitate us , because we did not behave without discipline among you ,
53003008	and we did not eat anyone’s food without paying . Instead , in toil and drudgery we worked night and day in order not to burden any of you .
53003009	It was not because we do not have that right , but to give ourselves as an example for you to imitate .
53003010	For even when we were with you , we used to give you this command : “ If anyone is not willing to work , neither should he eat . ”
53003011	For we hear that some among you are living an undisciplined life , not doing their own work but meddling in the work of others .
53003012	Now such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and so provide their own food to eat .
53003013	But you , brothers and sisters , do not grow weary in doing what is right .
53003014	But if anyone does not obey our message through this letter , take note of him and do not associate closely with him , so that he may be ashamed .
53003015	Yet do not regard him as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
53003016	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way . The Lord be with you all .
53003017	I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand , which is how I write in every letter .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope ,
54001002	to Timothy , my genuine child in the faith . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord !
54001003	As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia , stay on in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to spread false teachings ,
54001004	nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies . Such things promote useless speculations rather than God’s redemptive plan that operates by faith .
54001005	But the aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart , a good conscience , and a sincere faith .
54001006	Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion .
54001007	They want to be teachers of the law , but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently .
54001008	But we know that the law is good if someone uses it legitimately ,
54001009	realizing that law is not intended for a righteous person , but for lawless and rebellious people , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers ,
54001010	sexually immoral people , practicing homosexuals , kidnappers , liars , perjurers – in fact , for any who live contrary to sound teaching .
54001011	This accords with the glorious gospel of the blessed God that was entrusted to me .
54001012	I am grateful to the one who has strengthened me , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he considered me faithful in putting me into ministry ,
54001013	even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor , and an arrogant man . But I was treated with mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief ,
54001014	and our Lord’s grace was abundant , bringing faith and love in Christ Jesus .
54001015	This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance : “ Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ” – and I am the worst of them !
54001016	But here is why I was treated with mercy : so that in me as the worst , Christ Jesus could demonstrate his utmost patience , as an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life .
54001017	Now to the eternal king , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever ! Amen .
54001018	I put this charge before you , Timothy my child , in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you , in order that with such encouragement you may fight the good fight .
54001019	To do this you must hold firmly to faith and a good conscience , which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck in regard to the faith .
54001020	Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme .
54002001	First of all , then , I urge that requests , prayers , intercessions , and thanks be offered on behalf of all people ,
54002002	even for kings and all who are in authority , that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity .
54002003	Such prayer for all is good and welcomed before God our Savior ,
54002004	since he wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God and one intermediary between God and humanity , Christ Jesus , himself human ,
54002006	who gave himself as a ransom for all , revealing God’s purpose at his appointed time .
54002007	For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle – I am telling the truth ; I am not lying – and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
54002008	So I want the men to pray in every place , lifting up holy hands without anger or dispute .
54002009	Likewise the women are to dress in suitable apparel , with modesty and self-control . Their adornment must not be with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothing ,
54002010	but with good deeds , as is proper for women who profess reverence for God .
54002011	A woman must learn quietly with all submissiveness .
54002012	But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man . She must remain quiet .
54002013	For Adam was formed first and then Eve .
54002014	And Adam was not deceived , but the woman , because she was fully deceived , fell into transgression .
54002015	But she will be delivered through childbearing , if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control .
54003001	This saying is trustworthy : “ If someone aspires to the office of overseer , he desires a good work . ”
54003002	The overseer then must be above reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate , self-controlled , respectable , hospitable , an able teacher ,
54003003	not a drunkard , not violent , but gentle , not contentious , free from the love of money .
54003004	He must manage his own household well and keep his children in control without losing his dignity .
54003005	But if someone does not know how to manage his own household , how will he care for the church of God ?
54003006	He must not be a recent convert or he may become arrogant and fall into the punishment that the devil will exact .
54003007	And he must be well thought of by those outside the faith , so that he may not fall into disgrace and be caught by the devil’s trap .
54003008	Deacons likewise must be dignified , not two-faced , not given to excessive drinking , not greedy for gain ,
54003009	holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience .
54003010	And these also must be tested first and then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless .
54003011	Likewise also their wives must be dignified , not slanderous , temperate , faithful in every respect .
54003012	Deacons must be husbands of one wife and good managers of their children and their own households .
54003013	For those who have served well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I hope to come to you soon , but I am writing these instructions to you
54003015	in case I am delayed , to let you know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God , because it is the church of the living God , the support and bulwark of the truth .
54003016	And we all agree , our religion contains amazing revelation : He was revealed in the flesh , vindicated by the Spirit , seen by angels , proclaimed among Gentiles , believed on in the world , taken up in glory .
54004001	Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the later times some will desert the faith and occupy themselves with deceiving spirits and demonic teachings ,
54004002	influenced by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared .
54004003	They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth .
54004004	For every creation of God is good and no food is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving .
54004005	For it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer .
54004006	By pointing out such things to the brothers and sisters , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , having nourished yourself on the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed .
54004007	But reject those myths fit only for the godless and gullible , and train yourself for godliness .
54004008	For “ physical exercise has some value , but godliness is valuable in every way . It holds promise for the present life and for the life to come . ”
54004009	This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance .
54004010	In fact this is why we work hard and struggle , because we have set our hope on the living God , who is the Savior of all people , especially of believers .
54004011	Command and teach these things .
54004012	Let no one look down on you because you are young , but set an example for the believers in your speech , conduct , love , faithfulness , and purity .
54004013	Until I come , give attention to the public reading of scripture , to exhortation , to teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect the spiritual gift you have , given to you and confirmed by prophetic words when the elders laid hands on you .
54004015	Take pains with these things ; be absorbed in them , so that everyone will see your progress .
54004016	Be conscientious about how you live and what you teach . Persevere in this , because by doing so you will save both yourself and those who listen to you .
54005001	Do not address an older man harshly but appeal to him as a father . Speak to younger men as brothers ,
54005002	older women as mothers , and younger women as sisters – with complete purity .
54005003	Honor widows who are truly in need .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , they should first learn to fulfill their duty toward their own household and so repay their parents what is owed them . For this is what pleases God .
54005005	But the widow who is truly in need , and completely on her own , has set her hope on God and continues in her pleas and prayers night and day .
54005006	But the one who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives .
54005007	Reinforce these commands , so that they will be beyond reproach .
54005008	But if someone does not provide for his own , especially his own family , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	No widow should be put on the list unless she is at least sixty years old , was the wife of one husband ,
54005010	and has a reputation for good works : as one who has raised children , practiced hospitality , washed the feet of the saints , helped those in distress – as one who has exhibited all kinds of good works .
54005011	But do not accept younger widows on the list , because their passions may lead them away from Christ and they will desire to marry ,
54005012	and so incur judgment for breaking their former pledge .
54005013	And besides that , going around from house to house they learn to be lazy , and they are not only lazy , but also gossips and busybodies , talking about things they should not .
54005014	So I want younger women to marry , raise children , and manage a household , in order to give the adversary no opportunity to vilify us .
54005015	For some have already wandered away to follow Satan .
54005016	If a believing woman has widows in her family , let her help them . The church should not be burdened , so that it may help the widows who are truly in need .
54005017	Elders who provide effective leadership must be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching .
54005018	For the scripture says , “ Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain , ” and , “ The worker deserves his pay . ”
54005019	Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it can be confirmed by two or three witnesses .
54005020	Those guilty of sin must be rebuked before all , as a warning to the rest .
54005021	Before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels , I solemnly charge you to carry out these commands without prejudice or favoritism of any kind .
54005022	Do not lay hands on anyone hastily and so identify with the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
54005023	( Stop drinking just water , but use a little wine for your digestion and your frequent illnesses . )
54005024	The sins of some people are obvious , going before them into judgment , but for others , they show up later .
54005025	Similarly good works are also obvious , and the ones that are not cannot remain hidden .
54006001	Those who are under the yoke as slaves must regard their own masters as deserving of full respect . This will prevent the name of God and Christian teaching from being discredited .
54006002	But those who have believing masters must not show them less respect because they are brothers . Instead they are to serve all the more , because those who benefit from their service are believers and dearly loved . Teach them and exhort them about these things .
54006003	If someone spreads false teachings and does not agree with sound words ( that is , those of our Lord Jesus Christ ) and with the teaching that accords with godliness ,
54006004	he is conceited and understands nothing , but has an unhealthy interest in controversies and verbal disputes . This gives rise to envy , dissension , slanders , evil suspicions ,
54006005	and constant bickering by people corrupted in their minds and deprived of the truth , who suppose that godliness is a way of making a profit .
54006006	Now godliness combined with contentment brings great profit .
54006007	For we have brought nothing into this world and so we cannot take a single thing out either .
54006008	But if we have food and shelter , we will be satisfied with that .
54006009	Those who long to be rich , however , stumble into temptation and a trap and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is the root of all evils . Some people in reaching for it have strayed from the faith and stabbed themselves with many pains .
54006011	But you , as a person dedicated to God , keep away from all that . Instead pursue righteousness , godliness , faithfulness , love , endurance , and gentleness .
54006012	Compete well for the faith and lay hold of that eternal life you were called for and made your good confession for in the presence of many witnesses .
54006013	I charge you before God who gives life to all things and Christ Jesus who made his good confession before Pontius Pilate ,
54006014	to obey this command without fault or failure until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
54006015	– whose appearing the blessed and only Sovereign , the King of kings and Lord of lords , will reveal at the right time .
54006016	He alone possesses immortality and lives in unapproachable light , whom no human has ever seen or is able to see . To him be honor and eternal power ! Amen .
54006017	Command those who are rich in this world’s goods not to be haughty or to set their hope on riches , which are uncertain , but on God who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment .
54006018	Tell them to do good , to be rich in good deeds , to be generous givers , sharing with others .
54006019	In this way they will save up a treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the future and so lay hold of what is truly life .
54006020	O Timothy , protect what has been entrusted to you . Avoid the profane chatter and absurdities of so-called “ knowledge . ”
54006021	By professing it , some have strayed from the faith . Grace be with you all .
55001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , to further the promise of life in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	to Timothy , my dear child . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord !
55001003	I am thankful to God , whom I have served with a clear conscience as my ancestors did , when I remember you in my prayers as I do constantly night and day .
55001004	As I remember your tears , I long to see you , so that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	I recall your sincere faith that was alive first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice , and I am sure is in you .
55001006	Because of this I remind you to rekindle God’s gift that you possess through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For God did not give us a Spirit of fear but of power and love and self-control .
55001008	So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me , a prisoner for his sake , but by God’s power accept your share of suffering for the gospel .
55001009	He is the one who saved us and called us with a holy calling , not based on our works but on his own purpose and grace , granted to us in Christ Jesus before time began ,
55001010	but now made visible through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus . He has broken the power of death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel !
55001011	For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher .
55001012	Because of this , in fact , I suffer as I do . But I am not ashamed , because I know the one in whom my faith is set and I am convinced that he is able to protect what has been entrusted to me until that day .
55001013	Hold to the standard of sound words that you heard from me and do so with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Protect that good thing entrusted to you , through the Holy Spirit who lives within us .
55001015	You know that everyone in the province of Asia deserted me , including Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus , because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment .
55001017	But when he arrived in Rome , he eagerly searched for me and found me .
55001018	May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day ! And you know very well all the ways he served me in Ephesus .
55002001	So you , my child , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
55002002	And entrust what you heard me say in the presence of many others as witnesses to faithful people who will be competent to teach others as well .
55002003	Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life ; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him .
55002005	Also , if anyone competes as an athlete , he will not be crowned as the winner unless he competes according to the rules .
55002006	The farmer who works hard ought to have the first share of the crops .
55002007	Think about what I am saying and the Lord will give you understanding of all this .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , raised from the dead , a descendant of David ; such is my gospel ,
55002009	for which I suffer hardship to the point of imprisonment as a criminal , but God’s message is not imprisoned !
55002010	So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God , that they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus and its eternal glory .
55002011	This saying is trustworthy : If we died with him , we will also live with him .
55002012	If we endure , we will also reign with him . If we deny him , he will also deny us .
55002013	If we are unfaithful , he remains faithful , since he cannot deny himself .
55002014	Remind people of these things and solemnly charge them before the Lord not to wrangle over words . This is of no benefit ; it just brings ruin on those who listen .
55002015	Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed , teaching the message of truth accurately .
55002016	But avoid profane chatter , because those occupied with it will stray further and further into ungodliness ,
55002017	and their message will spread its infection like gangrene . Hymenaeus and Philetus are in this group .
55002018	They have strayed from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already occurred , and they are undermining some people’s faith .
55002019	However , God’s solid foundation remains standing , bearing this seal : “ The Lord knows those who are his , ” and “ Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from evil . ”
55002020	Now in a wealthy home there are not only gold and silver vessels , but also ones made of wood and of clay , and some are for honorable use , but others for ignoble use .
55002021	So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior , he will be a vessel for honorable use , set apart , useful for the Master , prepared for every good work .
55002022	But keep away from youthful passions , and pursue righteousness , faithfulness , love , and peace , in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart .
55002023	But reject foolish and ignorant controversies , because you know they breed infighting .
55002024	And the Lord’s slave must not engage in heated disputes but be kind toward all , an apt teacher , patient ,
55002025	correcting opponents with gentleness . Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth
55002026	and they will come to their senses and escape the devil’s trap where they are held captive to do his will .
55003001	But understand this , that in the last days difficult times will come .
55003002	For people will be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , boastful , arrogant , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , ungrateful , unholy ,
55003003	unloving , irreconcilable , slanderers , without self-control , savage , opposed to what is good ,
55003004	treacherous , reckless , conceited , loving pleasure rather than loving God .
55003005	They will maintain the outward appearance of religion but will have repudiated its power . So avoid people like these .
55003006	For some of these insinuate themselves into households and captivate weak women who are overwhelmed with sins and led along by various passions .
55003007	Such women are always seeking instruction , yet never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth .
55003008	And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so these people – who have warped minds and are disqualified in the faith – also oppose the truth .
55003009	But they will not go much further , for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone , just like it was with Jannes and Jambres .
55003010	You , however , have followed my teaching , my way of life , my purpose , my faith , my patience , my love , my endurance ,
55003011	as well as the persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch , in Iconium , and in Lystra . I endured these persecutions and the Lord delivered me from them all .
55003012	Now in fact all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted .
55003013	But evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse , deceiving others and being deceived themselves .
55003014	You , however , must continue in the things you have learned and are confident about . You know who taught you
55003015	and how from infancy you have known the holy writings , which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness ,
55003017	that the person dedicated to God may be capable and equipped for every good work .
55004001	I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus , who is going to judge the living and the dead , and by his appearing and his kingdom :
55004002	Preach the message , be ready whether it is convenient or not , reprove , rebuke , exhort with complete patience and instruction .
55004003	For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching . Instead , following their own desires , they will accumulate teachers for themselves , because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear new things .
55004004	And they will turn away from hearing the truth , but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths .
55004005	You , however , be self-controlled in all things , endure hardship , do an evangelist’s work , fulfill your ministry .
55004006	For I am already being poured out as an offering , and the time for me to depart is at hand .
55004007	I have competed well ; I have finished the race ; I have kept the faith !
55004008	Finally the crown of righteousness is reserved for me . The Lord , the righteous Judge , will award it to me in that day – and not to me only , but also to all who have set their affection on his appearing .
55004009	Make every effort to come to me soon .
55004010	For Demas deserted me , since he loved the present age , and he went to Thessalonica . Crescens went to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , because he is a great help to me in ministry .
55004012	Now I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring with you the cloak I left in Troas with Carpas and the scrolls , especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm . The Lord will repay him in keeping with his deeds .
55004015	You be on guard against him too , because he vehemently opposed our words .
55004016	At my first defense no one appeared in my support ; instead they all deserted me – may they not be held accountable for it .
55004017	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me , so that through me the message would be fully proclaimed for all the Gentiles to hear . And so I was delivered from the lion’s mouth !
55004018	The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom . To him be glory for ever and ever ! Amen .
55004019	Greetings to Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in Corinth . Trophimus I left ill in Miletus .
55004021	Make every effort to come before winter . Greetings to you from Eubulus , Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers and sisters .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you .
56001001	From Paul , a slave of God and apostle of Jesus Christ , to further the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth that is in keeping with godliness ,
56001002	in hope of eternal life , which God , who does not lie , promised before the ages began .
56001003	But now in his own time he has made his message evident through the preaching I was entrusted with according to the command of God our Savior .
56001004	To Titus , my genuine son in a common faith . Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior !
56001005	The reason I left you in Crete was to set in order the remaining matters and to appoint elders in every town , as I directed you .
56001006	An elder must be blameless , the husband of one wife , with faithful children who cannot be charged with dissipation or rebellion .
56001007	For the overseer must be blameless as one entrusted with God’s work , not arrogant , not prone to anger , not a drunkard , not violent , not greedy for gain .
56001008	Instead he must be hospitable , devoted to what is good , sensible , upright , devout , and self-controlled .
56001009	He must hold firmly to the faithful message as it has been taught , so that he will be able to give exhortation in such healthy teaching and correct those who speak against it .
56001010	For there are many rebellious people , idle talkers , and deceivers , especially those with Jewish connections ,
56001011	who must be silenced because they mislead whole families by teaching for dishonest gain what ought not to be taught .
56001012	A certain one of them , in fact , one of their own prophets , said , “ Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , lazy gluttons . ”
56001013	Such testimony is true . For this reason rebuke them sharply that they may be healthy in the faith
56001014	and not pay attention to Jewish myths and commands of people who reject the truth .
56001015	All is pure to those who are pure . But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving , nothing is pure , but both their minds and consciences are corrupted .
56001016	They profess to know God but with their deeds they deny him , since they are detestable , disobedient , and unfit for any good deed .
56002001	But as for you , communicate the behavior that goes with sound teaching .
56002002	Older men are to be temperate , dignified , self-controlled , sound in faith , in love , and in endurance .
56002003	Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy , not slandering , not slaves to excessive drinking , but teaching what is good .
56002004	In this way they will train the younger women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
56002005	to be self-controlled , pure , fulfilling their duties at home , kind , being subject to their own husbands , so that the message of God may not be discredited .
56002006	Encourage younger men likewise to be self-controlled ,
56002007	showing yourself to be an example of good works in every way . In your teaching show integrity , dignity ,
56002008	and a sound message that cannot be criticized , so that any opponent will be at a loss , because he has nothing evil to say about us .
56002009	Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in everything , to do what is wanted and not talk back ,
56002010	not pilfering , but showing all good faith , in order to bring credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything .
56002011	For the grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all people .
56002012	It trains us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live self-controlled , upright , and godly lives in the present age ,
56002013	as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ .
56002014	He gave himself for us to set us free from every kind of lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are truly his , who are eager to do good .
56002015	So communicate these things with the sort of exhortation or rebuke that carries full authority . Don’t let anyone look down on you .
56003001	Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities , to be obedient , to be ready for every good work .
56003002	They must not slander anyone , but be peaceable , gentle , showing complete courtesy to all people .
56003003	For we too were once foolish , disobedient , misled , enslaved to various passions and desires , spending our lives in evil and envy , hateful and hating one another .
56003004	But “ when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared ,
56003005	he saved us not by works of righteousness that we have done but on the basis of his mercy , through the washing of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	whom he poured out on us in full measure through Jesus Christ our Savior .
56003007	And so , since we have been justified by his grace , we become heirs with the confident expectation of eternal life . ”
56003008	This saying is trustworthy , and I want you to insist on such truths , so that those who have placed their faith in God may be intent on engaging in good works . These things are good and beneficial for all people .
56003009	But avoid foolish controversies , genealogies , quarrels , and fights about the law , because they are useless and empty .
56003010	Reject a divisive person after one or two warnings .
56003011	You know that such a person is twisted by sin and is conscious of it himself .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Make every effort to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way ; make sure they have what they need .
56003014	Here is another way that our people can learn to engage in good works to meet pressing needs and so not be unfruitful .
56003015	Everyone with me greets you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	From Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon , our dear friend and colaborer ,
57001002	to Apphia our sister , to Archippus our fellow soldier , and to the church that meets in your house .
57001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ !
57001004	I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers ,
57001005	because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints .
57001006	I pray that the faith you share with us may deepen your understanding of every blessing that belongs to you in Christ .
57001007	I have had great joy and encouragement because of your love , for the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you , brother .
57001008	So , although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper ,
57001009	I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love – I , Paul , an old man and even now a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus –
57001010	I am appealing to you concerning my child , whose spiritual father I have become during my imprisonment , that is , Onesimus ,
57001011	who was formerly useless to you , but is now useful to you and me .
57001012	I have sent him ( who is my very heart ) back to you .
57001013	I wanted to keep him so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel .
57001014	However , without your consent I did not want to do anything , so that your good deed would not be out of compulsion , but from your own willingness .
57001015	For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while , so that you would have him back eternally ,
57001016	no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , as a dear brother . He is especially so to me , and even more so to you now , both humanly speaking and in the Lord .
57001017	Therefore if you regard me as a partner , accept him as you would me .
57001018	Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything , charge what he owes to me .
57001019	I , Paul , have written this letter with my own hand : I will repay it . I could also mention that you owe me your very self .
57001020	Yes , brother , let me have some benefit from you in the Lord . Refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	Since I was confident that you would obey , I wrote to you , because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do .
57001022	At the same time also , prepare a place for me to stay , for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , greets you .
57001024	Mark , Aristarchus , Demas and Luke , my colaborers , greet you too .
57001025	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
58001001	After God spoke long ago in various portions and in various ways to our ancestors through the prophets ,
58001002	in these last days he has spoken to us in a son , whom he appointed heir of all things , and through whom he created the world .
58001003	The Son is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence , and he sustains all things by his powerful word , and so when he had accomplished cleansing for sins , he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high .
58001004	Thus he became so far better than the angels as he has inherited a name superior to theirs .
58001005	For to which of the angels did God ever say , “ You are my son ! Today I have fathered you ” ? And in another place he says , “ I will be his father and he will be my son . ”
58001006	But when he again brings his firstborn into the world , he says , “ Let all the angels of God worship him ! ”
58001007	And he says of the angels , “ He makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire , ”
58001008	but of the Son he says , “ Your throne , O God , is forever and ever , and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom .
58001009	You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness . So God , your God , has anointed you over your companions with the oil of rejoicing . ”
58001010	And , “ You founded the earth in the beginning , Lord , and the heavens are the works of your hands .
58001011	They will perish , but you continue . And they will all grow old like a garment ,
58001012	and like a robe you will fold them up and like a garment they will be changed , but you are the same and your years will never run out . ”
58001013	But to which of the angels has he ever said , “ Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet ” ?
58001014	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent out to serve those who will inherit salvation ?
58002001	Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard , so that we do not drift away .
58002002	For if the message spoken through angels proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty ,
58002003	how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation ? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him ,
58002004	while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will .
58002005	For he did not put the world to come , about which we are speaking , under the control of angels .
58002006	Instead someone testified somewhere : “ What is man that you think of him or the son of man that you care for him ?
58002007	You made him lower than the angels for a little while . You crowned him with glory and honor .
58002008	You put all things under his control . ” For when he put all things under his control , he left nothing outside of his control . At present we do not yet see all things under his control ,
58002009	but we see Jesus , who was made lower than the angels for a little while , now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death , so that by God’s grace he would experience death on behalf of everyone .
58002010	For it was fitting for him , for whom and through whom all things exist , in bringing many sons to glory , to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
58002011	For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have the same origin , and so he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters ,
58002012	saying , “ I will proclaim your name to my brothers ; in the midst of the assembly I will praise you . ”
58002013	Again he says , “ I will be confident in him , ” and again , “ Here I am , with the children God has given me . ”
58002014	Therefore , since the children share in flesh and blood , he likewise shared in their humanity , so that through death he could destroy the one who holds the power of death ( that is , the devil ) ,
58002015	and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death .
58002016	For surely his concern is not for angels , but he is concerned for Abraham’s descendants .
58002017	Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect , so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God , to make atonement for the sins of the people .
58002018	For since he himself suffered when he was tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .
58003001	Therefore , holy brothers and sisters , partners in a heavenly calling , take note of Jesus , the apostle and high priest whom we confess ,
58003002	who is faithful to the one who appointed him , as Moses was also in God’s house .
58003003	For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses , just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself !
58003004	For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God .
58003005	Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant , to testify to the things that would be spoken .
58003006	But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house . We are of his house , if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in .
58003007	Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says , “ Oh , that today you would listen as he speaks !
58003008	“ Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion , in the day of testing in the wilderness .
58003009	“ There your fathers tested me and tried me , and they saw my works for forty years .
58003010	“ Therefore , I became provoked at that generation and said , ‘ Their hearts are always wandering and they have not known my ways . ’
58003011	“ As I swore in my anger , ‘ They will never enter my rest ! ’ ”
58003012	See to it , brothers and sisters , that none of you has an evil , unbelieving heart that forsakes the living God .
58003013	But exhort one another each day , as long as it is called “ Today , ” that none of you may become hardened by sin’s deception .
58003014	For we have become partners with Christ , if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end .
58003015	As it says , “ Oh , that today you would listen as he speaks ! Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion . ”
58003016	For which ones heard and rebelled ? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses’ leadership ?
58003017	And against whom was God provoked for forty years ? Was it not those who sinned , whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness ?
58003018	And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest , except those who were disobedient ?
58003019	So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief .
58004001	Therefore we must be wary that , while the promise of entering his rest remains open , none of you may seem to have come short of it .
58004002	For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did . But the message they heard did them no good , since they did not join in with those who heard it in faith .
58004003	For we who have believed enter that rest , as he has said , “ As I swore in my anger , ‘ They will never enter my rest ! ’ ” And yet God’s works were accomplished from the foundation of the world .
58004004	For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works , ”
58004005	but to repeat the text cited earlier : “ They will never enter my rest ! ”
58004006	Therefore it remains for some to enter it , yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of disobedience .
58004007	So God again ordains a certain day , “ Today , ” speaking through David after so long a time , as in the words quoted before , “ O , that today you would listen as he speaks ! Do not harden your hearts . ”
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest , God would not have spoken afterward about another day .
58004009	Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God .
58004010	For the one who enters God’s rest has also rested from his works , just as God did from his own works .
58004011	Thus we must make every effort to enter that rest , so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience .
58004012	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword , piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit , and joints from marrow ; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart .
58004013	And no creature is hidden from God , but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account .
58004014	Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast to our confession .
58004015	For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses , but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are , yet without sin .
58004016	Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help .
58005001	For every high priest is taken from among the people and appointed to represent them before God , to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	He is able to deal compassionately with those who are ignorant and erring , since he also is subject to weakness ,
58005003	and for this reason he is obligated to make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people .
58005004	And no one assumes this honor on his own initiative , but only when called to it by God , as in fact Aaron was .
58005005	So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming high priest , but the one who glorified him was God , who said to him , “ You are my Son ! Today I have fathered you , ”
58005006	as also in another place God says , “ You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . ”
58005007	During his earthly life Christ offered both requests and supplications , with loud cries and tears , to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his devotion .
58005008	Although he was a son , he learned obedience through the things he suffered .
58005009	And by being perfected in this way , he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him ,
58005010	and he was designated by God as high priest in the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	On this topic we have much to say and it is difficult to explain , since you have become sluggish in hearing .
58005012	For though you should in fact be teachers by this time , you need someone to teach you the beginning elements of God’s utterances . You have gone back to needing milk , not solid food .
58005013	For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness , because he is an infant .
58005014	But solid food is for the mature , whose perceptions are trained by practice to discern both good and evil .
58006001	Therefore we must progress beyond the elementary instructions about Christ and move on to maturity , not laying this foundation again : repentance from dead works and faith in God ,
58006002	teaching about baptisms , laying on of hands , resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .
58006003	And this is what we intend to do , if God permits .
58006004	For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened , tasted the heavenly gift , become partakers of the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age ,
58006006	and then have committed apostasy , to renew them again to repentance , since they are crucifying the Son of God for themselves all over again and holding him up to contempt .
58006007	For the ground that has soaked up the rain that frequently falls on it and yields useful vegetation for those who tend it receives a blessing from God .
58006008	But if it produces thorns and thistles , it is useless and about to be cursed ; its fate is to be burned .
58006009	But in your case , dear friends , even though we speak like this , we are convinced of better things relating to salvation .
58006010	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have demonstrated for his name , in having served and continuing to serve the saints .
58006011	But we passionately want each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of your hope until the end ,
58006012	so that you may not be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherit the promises .
58006013	Now when God made his promise to Abraham , since he could swear by no one greater , he swore by himself ,
58006014	saying , “ Surely I will bless you greatly and multiply your descendants abundantly . ”
58006015	And so by persevering , Abraham inherited the promise .
58006016	For people swear by something greater than themselves , and the oath serves as a confirmation to end all dispute .
58006017	In the same way God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise that his purpose was unchangeable , and so he intervened with an oath ,
58006018	so that we who have found refuge in him may find strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us through two unchangeable things , since it is impossible for God to lie .
58006019	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul , sure and steadfast , which reaches inside behind the curtain ,
58006020	where Jesus our forerunner entered on our behalf , since he became a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	Now this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him .
58007002	To him also Abraham apportioned a tithe of everything . His name first means king of righteousness , then king of Salem , that is , king of peace .
58007003	Without father , without mother , without genealogy , he has neither beginning of days nor end of life but is like the son of God , and he remains a priest for all time .
58007004	But see how great he must be , if Abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe of his plunder .
58007005	And those of the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have authorization according to the law to collect a tithe from the people , that is , from their fellow countrymen , although they too are descendants of Abraham .
58007006	But Melchizedek who does not share their ancestry collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who possessed the promise .
58007007	Now without dispute the inferior is blessed by the superior ,
58007008	and in one case tithes are received by mortal men , while in the other by him who is affirmed to be alive .
58007009	And it could be said that Levi himself , who receives tithes , paid a tithe through Abraham .
58007010	For he was still in his ancestor Abraham’s loins when Melchizedek met him .
58007011	So if perfection had in fact been possible through the Levitical priesthood – for on that basis the people received the law – what further need would there have been for another priest to arise , said to be in the order of Melchizedek and not in Aaron’s order ?
58007012	For when the priesthood changes , a change in the law must come as well .
58007013	Yet the one these things are spoken about belongs to a different tribe , and no one from that tribe has ever officiated at the altar .
58007014	For it is clear that our Lord is descended from Judah , yet Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe .
58007015	And this is even clearer if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek ,
58007016	who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent but by the power of an indestructible life .
58007017	For here is the testimony about him : “ You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . ”
58007018	On the one hand a former command is set aside because it is weak and useless ,
58007019	for the law made nothing perfect . On the other hand a better hope is introduced , through which we draw near to God .
58007020	And since this was not done without a sworn affirmation – for the others have become priests without a sworn affirmation ,
58007021	but Jesus did so with a sworn affirmation by the one who said to him , “ The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind , ‘ You are a priest forever ’ ” –
58007022	accordingly Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant .
58007023	And the others who became priests were numerous , because death prevented them from continuing in office ,
58007024	but he holds his priesthood permanently since he lives forever .
58007025	So he is able to save completely those who come to God through him , because he always lives to intercede for them .
58007026	For it is indeed fitting for us to have such a high priest : holy , innocent , undefiled , separate from sinners , and exalted above the heavens .
58007027	He has no need to do every day what those priests do , to offer sacrifices first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people , since he did this in offering himself once for all .
58007028	For the law appoints as high priests men subject to weakness , but the word of solemn affirmation that came after the law appoints a son made perfect forever .
58008001	Now the main point of what we are saying is this : We have such a high priest , one who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven ,
58008002	a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord , not man , set up .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices . So this one too had to have something to offer .
58008004	Now if he were on earth , he would not be a priest , since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law .
58008005	The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary , just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle . For he says , “ See that you make everything according to the design shown to you on the mountain . ”
58008006	But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry , since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises .
58008007	For if that first covenant had been faultless , no one would have looked for a second one .
58008008	But showing its fault , God says to them , “ Look , the days are coming , says the Lord , when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah .
58008009	“ It will not be like the covenant that I made with their fathers , on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt , because they did not continue in my covenant and I had no regard for them , says the Lord .
58008010	“ For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their minds and I will inscribe them on their hearts . And I will be their God and they will be my people .
58008011	“ And there will be no need at all for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying , ‘ Know the Lord , ’ since they will all know me , from the least to the greatest .
58008012	“ For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds , and their sins I will remember no longer . ”
58008013	When he speaks of a new covenant , he makes the first obsolete . Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear .
58009001	Now the first covenant , in fact , had regulations for worship and its earthly sanctuary .
58009002	For a tent was prepared , the outer one , which contained the lampstand , the table , and the presentation of the loaves ; this is called the holy place .
58009003	And after the second curtain there was a tent called the holy of holies .
58009004	It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold . In this ark were the golden urn containing the manna , Aaron’s rod that budded , and the stone tablets of the covenant .
58009005	And above the ark were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat . Now is not the time to speak of these things in detail .
58009006	So with these things prepared like this , the priests enter continually into the outer tent as they perform their duties .
58009007	But only the high priest enters once a year into the inner tent , and not without blood that he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance .
58009008	The Holy Spirit is making clear that the way into the holy place had not yet appeared as long as the old tabernacle was standing .
58009009	This was a symbol for the time then present , when gifts and sacrifices were offered that could not perfect the conscience of the worshiper .
58009010	They served only for matters of food and drink and various washings ; they are external regulations imposed until the new order came .
58009011	But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things to come . He passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands , that is , not of this creation ,
58009012	and he entered once for all into the most holy place not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood , and so he himself secured eternal redemption .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity ,
58009014	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God , purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God .
58009015	And so he is the mediator of a new covenant , so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance he has promised , since he died to set them free from the violations committed under the first covenant .
58009016	For where there is a will , the death of the one who made it must be proven .
58009017	For a will takes effect only at death , since it carries no force while the one who made it is alive .
58009018	So even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood .
58009019	For when Moses had spoken every command to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
58009020	and said , “ This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded you to keep . ”
58009021	And both the tabernacle and all the utensils of worship he likewise sprinkled with blood .
58009022	Indeed according to the law almost everything was purified with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
58009023	So it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things themselves required better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands – the representation of the true sanctuary – but into heaven itself , and he appears now in God’s presence for us .
58009025	And he did not enter to offer himself again and again , the way the high priest enters the sanctuary year after year with blood that is not his own ,
58009026	for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world . But now he has appeared once for all at the consummation of the ages to put away sin by his sacrifice .
58009027	And just as people are appointed to die once , and then to face judgment ,
58009028	so also , after Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many , to those who eagerly await him he will appear a second time , not to bear sin but to bring salvation .
58010001	For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself , and is therefore completely unable , by the same sacrifices offered continually , year after year , to perfect those who come to worship .
58010002	For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered , since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have no further consciousness of sin ?
58010003	But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year .
58010004	For the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins .
58010005	So when he came into the world , he said , “ Sacrifice and offering you did not desire , but a body you prepared for me .
58010006	“ Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in .
58010007	“ Then I said , ‘ Here I am : I have come – it is written of me in the scroll of the book – to do your will , O God . ’ ”
58010008	When he says above , “ Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you did not desire nor did you take delight in them ” ( which are offered according to the law ) ,
58010009	then he says , “ Here I am : I have come to do your will . ” He does away with the first to establish the second .
58010010	By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58010011	And every priest stands day after day serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again – sacrifices that can never take away sins .
58010012	But when this priest had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time , he sat down at the right hand of God ,
58010013	where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet .
58010014	For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy .
58010015	And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us , for after saying ,
58010016	“ This is the covenant that I will establish with them after those days , says the Lord . I will put my laws on their hearts and I will inscribe them on their minds , ”
58010017	then he says , “ Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no longer . ”
58010018	Now where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer any offering for sin .
58010019	Therefore , brothers and sisters , since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us through the curtain , that is , through his flesh ,
58010021	and since we have a great priest over the house of God ,
58010022	let us draw near with a sincere heart in the assurance that faith brings , because we have had our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water .
58010023	And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess , for the one who made the promise is trustworthy .
58010024	And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works ,
58010025	not abandoning our own meetings , as some are in the habit of doing , but encouraging each other , and even more so because you see the day drawing near .
58010026	For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth , no further sacrifice for sins is left for us ,
58010027	but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume God’s enemies .
58010028	Someone who rejected the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much greater punishment do you think that person deserves who has contempt for the Son of God , and profanes the blood of the covenant that made him holy , and insults the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know the one who said , “ Vengeance is mine , I will repay , ” and again , “ The Lord will judge his people . ”
58010031	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	But remember the former days when you endured a harsh conflict of suffering after you were enlightened .
58010033	At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions , and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way .
58010034	For in fact you shared the sufferings of those in prison , and you accepted the confiscation of your belongings with joy , because you knew that you certainly had a better and lasting possession .
58010035	So do not throw away your confidence , because it has great reward .
58010036	For you need endurance in order to do God’s will and so receive what is promised .
58010037	For just a little longer and he who is coming will arrive and not delay .
58010038	But my righteous one will live by faith , and if he shrinks back , I take no pleasure in him .
58010039	But we are not among those who shrink back and thus perish , but are among those who have faith and preserve their souls .
58011001	Now faith is being sure of what we hope for , being convinced of what we do not see .
58011002	For by it the people of old received God’s commendation .
58011003	By faith we understand that the worlds were set in order at God’s command , so that the visible has its origin in the invisible .
58011004	By faith Abel offered God a greater sacrifice than Cain , and through his faith he was commended as righteous , because God commended him for his offerings . And through his faith he still speaks , though he is dead .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death , and he was not to be found because God took him up . For before his removal he had been commended as having pleased God .
58011006	Now without faith it is impossible to please him , for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him .
58011007	By faith Noah , when he was warned about things not yet seen , with reverent regard constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family . Through faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place he would later receive as an inheritance , and he went out without understanding where he was going .
58011009	By faith he lived as a foreigner in the promised land as though it were a foreign country , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , who were fellow heirs of the same promise .
58011010	For he was looking forward to the city with firm foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
58011011	By faith , even though Sarah herself was barren and he was too old , he received the ability to procreate , because he regarded the one who had given the promise to be trustworthy .
58011012	So in fact children were fathered by one man – and this one as good as dead – like the number of stars in the sky and like the innumerable grains of sand on the seashore .
58011013	These all died in faith without receiving the things promised , but they saw them in the distance and welcomed them and acknowledged that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth .
58011014	For those who speak in such a way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland .
58011015	In fact , if they had been thinking of the land that they had left , they would have had opportunity to return .
58011016	But as it is , they aspire to a better land , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore , God is not ashamed to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith Abraham , when he was tested , offered up Isaac . He had received the promises , yet he was ready to offer up his only son .
58011018	God had told him , “ Through Isaac descendants will carry on your name , ”
58011019	and he reasoned that God could even raise him from the dead , and in a sense he received him back from there .
58011020	By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the future .
58011021	By faith Jacob , as he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped as he leaned on his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph , at the end of his life , mentioned the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his burial .
58011023	By faith , when Moses was born , his parents hid him for three months , because they saw the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the king’s edict .
58011024	By faith , when he grew up , Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter ,
58011025	choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to enjoy sin’s fleeting pleasure .
58011026	He regarded abuse suffered for Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt , for his eyes were fixed on the reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt without fearing the king’s anger , for he persevered as though he could see the one who is invisible .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood , so that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them .
58011029	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry ground , but when the Egyptians tried it , they were swallowed up .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell after the people marched around them for seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab the prostitute escaped the destruction of the disobedient , because she welcomed the spies in peace .
58011032	And what more shall I say ? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets .
58011033	Through faith they conquered kingdoms , administered justice , gained what was promised , shut the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched raging fire , escaped the edge of the sword , gained strength in weakness , became mighty in battle , put foreign armies to flight ,
58011035	and women received back their dead raised to life . But others were tortured , not accepting release , to obtain resurrection to a better life .
58011036	And others experienced mocking and flogging , and even chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned , sawed apart , murdered with the sword ; they went about in sheepskins and goatskins ; they were destitute , afflicted , ill-treated
58011038	( the world was not worthy of them ) ; they wandered in deserts and mountains and caves and openings in the earth .
58011039	And these all were commended for their faith , yet they did not receive what was promised .
58011040	For God had provided something better for us , so that they would be made perfect together with us .
58012001	Therefore , since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses , we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely , and run with endurance the race set out for us ,
58012002	keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus , the pioneer and perfecter of our faith . For the joy set out for him he endured the cross , disregarding its shame , and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners , so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up .
58012004	You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin .
58012005	And have you forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons ? “ My son , do not scorn the Lord’s discipline or give up when he corrects you .
58012006	“ For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son he accepts . ”
58012007	Endure your suffering as discipline ; God is treating you as sons . For what son is there that a father does not discipline ?
58012008	But if you do not experience discipline , something all sons have shared in , then you are illegitimate and are not sons .
58012009	Besides , we have experienced discipline from our earthly fathers and we respected them ; shall we not submit ourselves all the more to the Father of spirits and receive life ?
58012010	For they disciplined us for a little while as seemed good to them , but he does so for our benefit , that we may share his holiness .
58012011	Now all discipline seems painful at the time , not joyful . But later it produces the fruit of peace and righteousness for those trained by it .
58012012	Therefore , strengthen your listless hands and your weak knees ,
58012013	and make straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but be healed .
58012014	Pursue peace with everyone , and holiness , for without it no one will see the Lord .
58012015	See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God , that no one be like a bitter root springing up and causing trouble , and through him many become defiled .
58012016	And see to it that no one becomes an immoral or godless person like Esau , who sold his own birthright for a single meal .
58012017	For you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no opportunity for repentance , although he sought the blessing with tears .
58012018	For you have not come to something that can be touched , to a burning fire and darkness and gloom and a whirlwind
58012019	and the blast of a trumpet and a voice uttering words such that those who heard begged to hear no more .
58012020	For they could not bear what was commanded : “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned . ”
58012021	In fact , the scene was so terrifying that Moses said , “ I shudder with fear . ”
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion , the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to myriads of angels , to the assembly
58012023	and congregation of the firstborn , who are enrolled in heaven , and to God , the judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous , who have been made perfect ,
58012024	and to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks of something better than Abel’s does .
58012025	Take care not to refuse the one who is speaking ! For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth , how much less shall we , if we reject the one who warns from heaven ?
58012026	Then his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , “ I will once more shake not only the earth but heaven too . ”
58012027	Now this phrase “ once more ” indicates the removal of what is shaken , that is , of created things , so that what is unshaken may remain .
58012028	So since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom , let us give thanks , and through this let us offer worship pleasing to God in devotion and awe .
58012029	For our God is indeed a devouring fire .
58013001	Brotherly love must continue .
58013002	Do not neglect hospitality , because through it some have entertained angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember those in prison as though you were in prison with them , and those ill-treated as though you too felt their torment .
58013004	Marriage must be honored among all and the marriage bed kept undefiled , for God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers .
58013005	Your conduct must be free from the love of money and you must be content with what you have , for he has said , “ I will never leave you and I will never abandon you . ”
58013006	So we can say with confidence , “ The Lord is my helper , and I will not be afraid . What can man do to me ? ”
58013007	Remember your leaders , who spoke God’s message to you ; reflect on the outcome of their lives and imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever !
58013009	Do not be carried away by all sorts of strange teachings . For it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace , not ritual meals , which have never benefited those who participated in them .
58013010	We have an altar that those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat from .
58013011	For the bodies of those animals whose blood the high priest brings into the sanctuary as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp .
58013012	Therefore , to sanctify the people by his own blood , Jesus also suffered outside the camp .
58013013	We must go out to him , then , outside the camp , bearing the abuse he experienced .
58013014	For here we have no lasting city , but we seek the city that is to come .
58013015	Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God , that is , the fruit of our lips , acknowledging his name .
58013016	And do not neglect to do good and to share what you have , for God is pleased with such sacrifices .
58013017	Obey your leaders and submit to them , for they keep watch over your souls and will give an account for their work . Let them do this with joy and not with complaints , for this would be no advantage for you .
58013018	Pray for us , for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to conduct ourselves rightly in every respect .
58013019	I especially ask you to pray that I may be restored to you very soon .
58013020	Now may the God of peace who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep , our Lord Jesus Christ ,
58013021	equip you with every good thing to do his will , working in us what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory forever . Amen .
58013022	Now I urge you , brothers and sisters , bear with my message of exhortation , for in fact I have written to you briefly .
58013023	You should know that our brother Timothy has been released . If he comes soon , he will be with me when I see you .
58013024	Greetings to all your leaders and all the saints . Those from Italy send you greetings .
58013025	Grace be with you all .
59001001	From James , a slave of God and the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes dispersed abroad . Greetings !
59001002	My brothers and sisters , consider it nothing but joy when you fall into all sorts of trials ,
59001003	because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance .
59001004	And let endurance have its perfect effect , so that you will be perfect and complete , not deficient in anything .
59001005	But if anyone is deficient in wisdom , he should ask God , who gives to all generously and without reprimand , and it will be given to him .
59001006	But he must ask in faith without doubting , for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea , blown and tossed around by the wind .
59001007	For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ,
59001008	since he is a double-minded individual , unstable in all his ways .
59001009	Now the believer of humble means should take pride in his high position .
59001010	But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation , because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow .
59001011	For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow ; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever . So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away .
59001012	Happy is the one who endures testing , because when he has proven to be genuine , he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him .
59001013	Let no one say when he is tempted , “ I am tempted by God , ” for God cannot be tempted by evil , and he himself tempts no one .
59001014	But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires .
59001015	Then when desire conceives , it gives birth to sin , and when sin is full grown , it gives birth to death .
59001016	Do not be led astray , my dear brothers and sisters .
59001017	All generous giving and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom there is no variation or the slightest hint of change .
59001018	By his sovereign plan he gave us birth through the message of truth , that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all he created .
59001019	Understand this , my dear brothers and sisters ! Let every person be quick to listen , slow to speak , slow to anger .
59001020	For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness .
59001021	So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly welcome the message implanted within you , which is able to save your souls .
59001022	But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves .
59001023	For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out , he is like someone who gazes at his own face in a mirror .
59001024	For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets what sort of person he was .
59001025	But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there , and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out – he will be blessed in what he does .
59001026	If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue , and so deceives his heart , his religion is futile .
59001027	Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this : to care for orphans and widows in their misfortune and to keep oneself unstained by the world .
59002001	My brothers and sisters , do not show prejudice if you possess faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ .
59002002	For if someone comes into your assembly wearing a gold ring and fine clothing , and a poor person enters in filthy clothes ,
59002003	do you pay attention to the one who is finely dressed and say , “ You sit here in a good place , ” and to the poor person , “ You stand over there , ” or “ Sit on the floor ” ?
59002004	If so , have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives ?
59002005	Listen , my dear brothers and sisters ! Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor ! Are not the rich oppressing you and dragging you into the courts ?
59002007	Do they not blaspheme the good name of the one you belong to ?
59002008	But if you fulfill the royal law as expressed in this scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing well .
59002009	But if you show prejudice , you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as violators .
59002010	For the one who obeys the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it .
59002011	For he who said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ Do not murder . ” Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder , you have become a violator of the law .
59002012	Speak and act as those who will be judged by a law that gives freedom .
59002013	For judgment is merciless for the one who has shown no mercy . But mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	What good is it , my brothers and sisters , if someone claims to have faith but does not have works ? Can this kind of faith save him ?
59002015	If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacks daily food ,
59002016	and one of you says to them , “ Go in peace , keep warm and eat well , ” but you do not give them what the body needs , what good is it ?
59002017	So also faith , if it does not have works , is dead being by itself .
59002018	But someone will say , “ You have faith and I have works . ” Show me your faith without works and I will show you faith by my works .
59002019	You believe that God is one ; well and good . Even the demons believe that – and tremble with fear .
59002020	But would you like evidence , you empty fellow , that faith without works is useless ?
59002021	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar ?
59002022	You see that his faith was working together with his works and his faith was perfected by works .
59002023	And the scripture was fulfilled that says , “ Now Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness , ” and he was called God’s friend .
59002024	You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone .
59002025	And similarly , was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another way ?
59002026	For just as the body without the spirit is dead , so also faith without works is dead .
59003001	Not many of you should become teachers , my brothers and sisters , because you know that we will be judged more strictly .
59003002	For we all stumble in many ways . If someone does not stumble in what he says , he is a perfect individual , able to control the entire body as well .
59003003	And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to get them to obey us , then we guide their entire bodies .
59003004	Look at ships too : Though they are so large and driven by harsh winds , they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot’s inclination directs .
59003005	So too the tongue is a small part of the body , yet it has great pretensions . Think how small a flame sets a huge forest ablaze .
59003006	And the tongue is a fire ! The tongue represents the world of wrongdoing among the parts of our bodies . It pollutes the entire body and sets fire to the course of human existence – and is set on fire by hell .
59003007	For every kind of animal , bird , reptile , and sea creature is subdued and has been subdued by humankind .
59003008	But no human being can subdue the tongue ; it is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless the Lord and Father , and with it we curse people made in God’s image .
59003010	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing . These things should not be so , my brothers and sisters .
59003011	A spring does not pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening , does it ?
59003012	Can a fig tree produce olives , my brothers and sisters , or a vine produce figs ? Neither can a salt water spring produce fresh water .
59003013	Who is wise and understanding among you ? By his good conduct he should show his works done in the gentleness that wisdom brings .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness in your hearts , do not boast and tell lies against the truth .
59003015	Such wisdom does not come from above but is earthly , natural , demonic .
59003016	For where there is jealousy and selfishness , there is disorder and every evil practice .
59003017	But the wisdom from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , accommodating , full of mercy and good fruit , impartial , and not hypocritical .
59003018	And the fruit that consists of righteousness is planted in peace among those who make peace .
59004001	Where do the conflicts and where do the quarrels among you come from ? Is it not from this , from your passions that battle inside you ?
59004002	You desire and you do not have ; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain ; you quarrel and fight . You do not have because you do not ask ;
59004003	you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly , so you can spend it on your passions .
59004004	Adulterers , do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God ? So whoever decides to be the world’s friend makes himself God’s enemy .
59004005	Or do you think the scripture means nothing when it says , “ The spirit that God caused to live within us has an envious yearning ” ?
59004006	But he gives greater grace . Therefore it says , “ God opposes the proud , but he gives grace to the humble . ”
59004007	So submit to God . But resist the devil and he will flee from you .
59004008	Draw near to God and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and make your hearts pure , you double-minded .
59004009	Grieve , mourn , and weep . Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into despair .
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you .
59004011	Do not speak against one another , brothers and sisters . He who speaks against a fellow believer or judges a fellow believer speaks against the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but its judge .
59004012	But there is only one who is lawgiver and judge – the one who is able to save and destroy . On the other hand , who are you to judge your neighbor ?
59004013	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit . ”
59004014	You do not know about tomorrow . What is your life like ? For you are a puff of smoke that appears for a short time and then vanishes .
59004015	You ought to say instead , “ If the Lord is willing , then we will live and do this or that . ”
59004016	But as it is , you boast in your arrogance . All such boasting is evil .
59004017	So whoever knows what is good to do and does not do it is guilty of sin .
59005001	Come now , you rich ! Weep and cry aloud over the miseries that are coming on you .
59005002	Your riches have rotted and your clothing has become moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be a witness against you . It will consume your flesh like fire . It is in the last days that you have hoarded treasure !
59005004	Look , the pay you have held back from the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you , and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts .
59005005	You have lived indulgently and luxuriously on the earth . You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned and murdered the righteous person , although he does not resist you .
59005007	So be patient , brothers and sisters , until the Lord’s return . Think of how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the ground and is patient for it until it receives the early and late rains .
59005008	You also be patient and strengthen your hearts , for the Lord’s return is near .
59005009	Do not grumble against one another , brothers and sisters , so that you may not be judged . See , the judge stands before the gates !
59005010	As an example of suffering and patience , brothers and sisters , take the prophets who spoke in the Lord’s name .
59005011	Think of how we regard as blessed those who have endured . You have heard of Job’s endurance and you have seen the Lord’s purpose , that the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
59005012	And above all , my brothers and sisters , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath . But let your “ Yes ” be yes and your “ No ” be no , so that you may not fall into judgment .
59005013	Is anyone among you suffering ? He should pray . Is anyone in good spirits ? He should sing praises .
59005014	Is anyone among you ill ? He should summon the elders of the church , and they should pray for him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up – and if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
59005016	So confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous person has great effectiveness .
59005017	Elijah was a human being like us , and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain and there was no rain on the land for three years and six months !
59005018	Then he prayed again , and the sky gave rain and the land sprouted with a harvest .
59005019	My brothers and sisters , if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back ,
59005020	he should know that the one who turns a sinner back from his wandering path will save that person’s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins .
60001001	From Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to those temporarily residing abroad ( in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , the province of Asia , and Bithynia ) who are chosen
60001002	according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by being set apart by the Spirit for obedience and for sprinkling with Jesus Christ’s blood . May grace and peace be yours in full measure !
60001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! By his great mercy he gave us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60001004	that is , into an inheritance imperishable , undefiled , and unfading . It is reserved in heaven for you ,
60001005	who by God’s power are protected through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
60001006	This brings you great joy , although you may have to suffer for a short time in various trials .
60001007	Such trials show the proven character of your faith , which is much more valuable than gold – gold that is tested by fire , even though it is passing away – and will bring praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001008	You have not seen him , but you love him . You do not see him now but you believe in him , and so you rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy ,
60001009	because you are attaining the goal of your faith – the salvation of your souls .
60001010	Concerning this salvation , the prophets who predicted the grace that would come to you searched and investigated carefully .
60001011	They probed into what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he testified beforehand about the sufferings appointed for Christ and his subsequent glory .
60001012	They were shown that they were serving not themselves but you , in regard to the things now announced to you through those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven – things angels long to catch a glimpse of .
60001013	Therefore , get your minds ready for action by being fully sober , and set your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001014	Like obedient children , do not comply with the evil urges you used to follow in your ignorance ,
60001015	but , like the Holy One who called you , become holy yourselves in all of your conduct ,
60001016	for it is written , “ You shall be holy , because I am holy . ”
60001017	And if you address as Father the one who impartially judges according to each one’s work , live out the time of your temporary residence here in reverence .
60001018	You know that from your empty way of life inherited from your ancestors you were ransomed – not by perishable things like silver or gold ,
60001019	but by precious blood like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb , namely Christ .
60001020	He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was manifested in these last times for your sake .
60001021	Through him you now trust in God , who raised him from the dead and gave him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God .
60001022	You have purified your souls by obeying the truth in order to show sincere mutual love . So love one another earnestly from a pure heart .
60001023	You have been born anew , not from perishable but from imperishable seed , through the living and enduring word of God .
60001024	For all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of the grass ; the grass withers and the flower falls off ,
60001025	but the word of the Lord endures forever . And this is the word that was proclaimed to you .
60002001	So get rid of all evil and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander .
60002002	And yearn like newborn infants for pure , spiritual milk , so that by it you may grow up to salvation ,
60002003	if you have experienced the Lord’s kindness .
60002004	So as you come to him , a living stone rejected by men but chosen and priceless in God’s sight ,
60002005	you yourselves , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood and to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	For it says in scripture , “ Look , I lay in Zion a stone , a chosen and priceless cornerstone , and whoever believes in him will never be put to shame . ”
60002007	So you who believe see his value , but for those who do not believe , the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ,
60002008	and a stumbling-stone and a rock to trip over . They stumble because they disobey the word , as they were destined to do .
60002009	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people of his own , so that you may proclaim the virtues of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light .
60002010	You once were not a people , but now you are God’s people . You were shown no mercy , but now you have received mercy .
60002011	Dear friends , I urge you as foreigners and exiles to keep away from fleshly desires that do battle against the soul ,
60002012	and maintain good conduct among the non-Christians , so that though they now malign you as wrongdoers , they may see your good deeds and glorify God when he appears .
60002013	Be subject to every human institution for the Lord’s sake , whether to a king as supreme
60002014	or to governors as those he commissions to punish wrongdoers and praise those who do good .
60002015	For God wants you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing good .
60002016	Live as free people , not using your freedom as a pretext for evil , but as God’s slaves .
60002017	Honor all people , love the family of believers , fear God , honor the king .
60002018	Slaves , be subject to your masters with all reverence , not only to those who are good and gentle , but also to those who are perverse .
60002019	For this finds God’s favor , if because of conscience toward God someone endures hardships in suffering unjustly .
60002020	For what credit is it if you sin and are mistreated and endure it ? But if you do good and suffer and so endure , this finds favor with God .
60002021	For to this you were called , since Christ also suffered for you , leaving an example for you to follow in his steps .
60002022	He committed no sin nor was deceit found in his mouth .
60002023	When he was maligned , he did not answer back ; when he suffered , he threatened no retaliation , but committed himself to God who judges justly .
60002024	He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we may cease from sinning and live for righteousness . By his wounds you were healed .
60002025	For you were going astray like sheep but now you have turned back to the shepherd and guardian of your souls .
60003001	In the same way , wives , be subject to your own husbands . Then , even if some are disobedient to the word , they will be won over without a word by the way you live ,
60003002	when they see your pure and reverent conduct .
60003003	Let your beauty not be external – the braiding of hair and wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes –
60003004	but the inner person of the heart , the lasting beauty of a gentle and tranquil spirit , which is precious in God’s sight .
60003005	For in the same way the holy women who hoped in God long ago adorned themselves by being subject to their husbands ,
60003006	like Sarah who obeyed Abraham , calling him lord . You become her children when you do what is good and have no fear in doing so .
60003007	Husbands , in the same way , treat your wives with consideration as the weaker partners and show them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life . In this way nothing will hinder your prayers .
60003008	Finally , all of you be harmonious , sympathetic , affectionate , compassionate , and humble .
60003009	Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult , but instead bless others because you were called to inherit a blessing .
60003010	For the one who wants to love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from uttering deceit .
60003011	And he must turn away from evil and do good ; he must seek peace and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer . But the Lord’s face is against those who do evil .
60003013	For who is going to harm you if you are devoted to what is good ?
60003014	But in fact , if you happen to suffer for doing what is right , you are blessed . But do not be terrified of them or be shaken .
60003015	But set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts and always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks about the hope you possess .
60003016	Yet do it with courtesy and respect , keeping a good conscience , so that those who slander your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame when they accuse you .
60003017	For it is better to suffer for doing good , if God wills it , than for doing evil .
60003018	Because Christ also suffered once for sins , the just for the unjust , to bring you to God , by being put to death in the flesh but by being made alive in the spirit .
60003019	In it he went and preached to the spirits in prison ,
60003020	after they were disobedient long ago when God patiently waited in the days of Noah as an ark was being constructed . In the ark a few , that is eight souls , were delivered through water .
60003021	And this prefigured baptism , which now saves you – not the washing off of physical dirt but the pledge of a good conscience to God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60003022	who went into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels and authorities and powers subject to him .
60004001	So , since Christ suffered in the flesh , you also arm yourselves with the same attitude , because the one who has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin ,
60004002	in that he spends the rest of his time on earth concerned about the will of God and not human desires .
60004003	For the time that has passed was sufficient for you to do what the non-Christians desire . You lived then in debauchery , evil desires , drunkenness , carousing , drinking bouts , and wanton idolatries .
60004004	So they are astonished when you do not rush with them into the same flood of wickedness , and they vilify you .
60004005	They will face a reckoning before Jesus Christ who stands ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	Now it was for this very purpose that the gospel was preached to those who are now dead , so that though they were judged in the flesh by human standards they may live spiritually by God’s standards .
60004007	For the culmination of all things is near . So be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of prayer .
60004008	Above all keep your love for one another fervent , because love covers a multitude of sins .
60004009	Show hospitality to one another without complaining .
60004010	Just as each one has received a gift , use it to serve one another as good stewards of the varied grace of God .
60004011	Whoever speaks , let it be with God’s words . Whoever serves , do so with the strength that God supplies , so that in everything God will be glorified through Jesus Christ . To him belong the glory and the power forever and ever . Amen .
60004012	Dear friends , do not be astonished that a trial by fire is occurring among you , as though something strange were happening to you .
60004013	But rejoice in the degree that you have shared in the sufferings of Christ , so that when his glory is revealed you may also rejoice and be glad .
60004014	If you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed , because the Spirit of glory , who is the Spirit of God , rests on you .
60004015	But let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or criminal or as a troublemaker .
60004016	But if you suffer as a Christian , do not be ashamed , but glorify God that you bear such a name .
60004017	For it is time for judgment to begin , starting with the house of God . And if it starts with us , what will be the fate of those who are disobedient to the gospel of God ?
60004018	And if the righteous are barely saved , what will become of the ungodly and sinners ?
60004019	So then let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator as they do good .
60005001	So as your fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings and as one who shares in the glory that will be revealed , I urge the elders among you :
60005002	Give a shepherd’s care to God’s flock among you , exercising oversight not merely as a duty but willingly under God’s direction , not for shameful profit but eagerly .
60005003	And do not lord it over those entrusted to you , but be examples to the flock .
60005004	Then when the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the crown of glory that never fades away .
60005005	In the same way , you who are younger , be subject to the elders . And all of you , clothe yourselves with humility toward one another , because God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble .
60005006	And God will exalt you in due time , if you humble yourselves under his mighty hand
60005007	by casting all your cares on him because he cares for you .
60005008	Be sober and alert . Your enemy the devil , like a roaring lion , is on the prowl looking for someone to devour .
60005009	Resist him , strong in your faith , because you know that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are enduring the same kinds of suffering .
60005010	And , after you have suffered for a little while , the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself restore , confirm , strengthen , and establish you .
60005011	To him belongs the power forever . Amen .
60005012	Through Silvanus , whom I know to be a faithful brother , I have written to you briefly , in order to encourage you and testify that this is the true grace of God . Stand fast in it .
60005013	The church in Babylon , chosen together with you , greets you , and so does Mark , my son .
60005014	Greet one another with a loving kiss . Peace to all of you who are in Christ .
61001001	From Simeon Peter , a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ , have been granted a faith just as precious as ours .
61001002	May grace and peace be lavished on you as you grow in the rich knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord !
61001003	I can pray this because his divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for life and godliness through the rich knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence .
61001004	Through these things he has bestowed on us his precious and most magnificent promises , so that by means of what was promised you may become partakers of the divine nature , after escaping the worldly corruption that is produced by evil desire .
61001005	For this very reason , make every effort to add to your faith excellence , to excellence , knowledge ;
61001006	to knowledge , self-control ; to self-control , perseverance ; to perseverance , godliness ;
61001007	to godliness , brotherly affection ; to brotherly affection , unselfish love .
61001008	For if these things are really yours and are continually increasing , they will keep you from becoming ineffective and unproductive in your pursuit of knowing our Lord Jesus Christ more intimately .
61001009	But concerning the one who lacks such things – he is blind . That is to say , he is nearsighted , since he has forgotten about the cleansing of his past sins .
61001010	Therefore , brothers and sisters , make every effort to be sure of your calling and election . For by doing this you will never stumble into sin .
61001011	For thus an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ , will be richly provided for you .
61001012	Therefore , I intend to remind you constantly of these things even though you know them and are well established in the truth that you now have .
61001013	Indeed , as long as I am in this tabernacle , I consider it right to stir you up by way of a reminder ,
61001014	since I know that my tabernacle will soon be removed , because our Lord Jesus Christ revealed this to me .
61001015	Indeed , I will also make every effort that , after my departure , you have a testimony of these things .
61001016	For we did not follow cleverly concocted fables when we made known to you the power and return of our Lord Jesus Christ ; no , we were eyewitnesses of his grandeur .
61001017	For he received honor and glory from God the Father , when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory : “ This is my dear Son , in whom I am delighted . ”
61001018	When this voice was conveyed from heaven , we ourselves heard it , for we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	Moreover , we possess the prophetic word as an altogether reliable thing . You do well if you pay attention to this as you would to a light shining in a murky place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	Above all , you do well if you recognize this : No prophecy of scripture ever comes about by the prophet’s own imagination ,
61001021	for no prophecy was ever borne of human impulse ; rather , men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God .
61002001	But false prophets arose among the people , just as there will be false teachers among you . These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies , even to the point of denying the Master who bought them . As a result , they will bring swift destruction on themselves .
61002002	And many will follow their debauched lifestyles . Because of these false teachers , the way of truth will be slandered .
61002003	And in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words . Their condemnation pronounced long ago is not sitting idly by ; their destruction is not asleep .
61002004	For if God did not spare the angels who sinned , but threw them into hell and locked them up in chains in utter darkness , to be kept until the judgment ,
61002005	and if he did not spare the ancient world , but did protect Noah , a herald of righteousness , along with seven others , when God brought a flood on an ungodly world ,
61002006	and if he turned to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah when he condemned them to destruction , having appointed them to serve as an example to future generations of the ungodly ,
61002007	and if he rescued Lot , a righteous man in anguish over the debauched lifestyle of lawless men ,
61002008	( for while he lived among them day after day , that righteous man was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard )
61002009	– if so , then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from their trials , and to reserve the unrighteous for punishment at the day of judgment ,
61002010	especially those who indulge their fleshly desires and who despise authority . Brazen and insolent , they are not afraid to insult the glorious ones ,
61002011	yet even angels , who are much more powerful , do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these men , like irrational animals – creatures of instinct , born to be caught and destroyed – do not understand whom they are insulting , and consequently in their destruction they will be destroyed ,
61002013	suffering harm as the wages for their harmful ways . By considering it a pleasure to carouse in broad daylight , they are stains and blemishes , indulging in their deceitful pleasures when they feast together with you .
61002014	Their eyes , full of adultery , never stop sinning ; they entice unstable people . They have trained their hearts for greed , these cursed children !
61002015	By forsaking the right path they have gone astray , because they followed the way of Balaam son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ,
61002016	yet was rebuked for his own transgression ( a dumb donkey , speaking with a human voice , restrained the prophet’s madness ) .
61002017	These men are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm , for whom the utter depths of darkness have been reserved .
61002018	For by speaking high-sounding but empty words they are able to entice , with fleshly desires and with debauchery , people who have just escaped from those who reside in error .
61002019	Although these false teachers promise such people freedom , they themselves are enslaved to immorality . For whatever a person succumbs to , to that he is enslaved .
61002020	For if after they have escaped the filthy things of the world through the rich knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they again get entangled in them and succumb to them , their last state has become worse for them than their first .
61002021	For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than , having known it , to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them .
61002022	They are illustrations of this true proverb : “ A dog returns to its own vomit , ” and “ A sow , after washing herself , wallows in the mire . ”
61003001	Dear friends , this is already the second letter I have written you , in which I am trying to stir up your pure mind by way of reminder :
61003002	I want you to recall both the predictions foretold by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles .
61003003	Above all , understand this : In the last days blatant scoffers will come , being propelled by their own evil urges
61003004	and saying , “ Where is his promised return ? For ever since our ancestors died , all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation . ”
61003005	For they deliberately suppress this fact , that by the word of God heavens existed long ago and an earth was formed out of water and by means of water .
61003006	Through these things the world existing at that time was destroyed when it was deluged with water .
61003007	But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire , by being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly .
61003008	Now , dear friends , do not let this one thing escape your notice , that a single day is like a thousand years with the Lord and a thousand years are like a single day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some regard slowness , but is being patient toward you , because he does not wish for any to perish but for all to come to repentance .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief ; when it comes , the heavens will disappear with a horrific noise , and the celestial bodies will melt away in a blaze , and the earth and every deed done on it will be laid bare .
61003011	Since all these things are to melt away in this manner , what sort of people must we be , conducting our lives in holiness and godliness ,
61003012	while waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God ? Because of this day , the heavens will be burned up and dissolve , and the celestial bodies will melt away in a blaze !
61003013	But , according to his promise , we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth , in which righteousness truly resides .
61003014	Therefore , dear friends , since you are waiting for these things , strive to be found at peace , without spot or blemish , when you come into his presence .
61003015	And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation , just as also our dear brother Paul wrote to you , according to the wisdom given to him ,
61003016	speaking of these things in all his letters . Some things in these letters are hard to understand , things the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction , as they also do to the rest of the scriptures .
61003017	Therefore , dear friends , since you have been forewarned , be on your guard that you do not get led astray by the error of these unprincipled men and fall from your firm grasp on the truth .
61003018	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the honor both now and on that eternal day .
62001001	This is what we proclaim to you : what was from the beginning , what we have heard , what we have seen with our eyes , what we have looked at and our hands have touched ( concerning the word of life –
62001002	and the life was revealed , and we have seen and testify and announce to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us ) .
62001003	What we have seen and heard we announce to you too , so that you may have fellowship with us ( and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ ) .
62001004	Thus we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete .
62001005	Now this is the gospel message we have heard from him and announce to you : God is light , and in him there is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we say we have fellowship with him and yet keep on walking in the darkness , we are lying and not practicing the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light , we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin .
62001008	If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin , we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62001009	But if we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous , forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness .
62001010	If we say we have not sinned , we make him a liar and his word is not in us .
62002001	( My little children , I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin . ) But if anyone does sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous One ,
62002002	and he himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not only for our sins but also for the whole world .
62002003	Now by this we know that we have come to know God : if we keep his commandments .
62002004	The one who says “ I have come to know God ” and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar , and the truth is not in such a person .
62002005	But whoever obeys his word , truly in this person the love of God has been perfected . By this we know that we are in him .
62002006	The one who says he resides in God ought himself to walk just as Jesus walked .
62002007	Dear friends , I am not writing a new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word that you have already heard .
62002008	On the other hand , I am writing a new commandment to you which is true in him and in you , because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining .
62002009	The one who says he is in the light but still hates his fellow Christian is still in the darkness .
62002010	The one who loves his fellow Christian resides in the light , and there is no cause for stumbling in him .
62002011	But the one who hates his fellow Christian is in the darkness , walks in the darkness , and does not know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I am writing to you , little children , that your sins have been forgiven because of his name .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , that you have known him who has been from the beginning . I am writing to you , young people , that you have conquered the evil one .
62002014	I have written to you , children , that you have known the Father . I have written to you , fathers , that you have known him who has been from the beginning . I have written to you , young people , that you are strong , and the word of God resides in you , and you have conquered the evil one .
62002015	Do not love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him ,
62002016	because all that is in the world ( the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance produced by material possessions ) is not from the Father , but is from the world .
62002017	And the world is passing away with all its desires , but the person who does the will of God remains forever .
62002018	Children , it is the last hour , and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming , so now many antichrists have appeared . We know from this that it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us , but they did not really belong to us , because if they had belonged to us , they would have remained with us . But they went out from us to demonstrate that all of them do not belong to us .
62002020	Nevertheless you have an anointing from the Holy One , and you all know .
62002021	I have not written to you that you do not know the truth , but that you do know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar but the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This one is the antichrist : the person who denies the Father and the Son .
62002023	Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either . The person who confesses the Son has the Father also .
62002024	As for you , what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you . If what you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	Now this is the promise that he himself made to us : eternal life .
62002026	These things I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you .
62002027	Now as for you , the anointing that you received from him resides in you , and you have no need for anyone to teach you . But as his anointing teaches you about all things , it is true and is not a lie . Just as it has taught you , you reside in him .
62002028	And now , little children , remain in him , so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink away from him in shame when he comes back .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous , you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been fathered by him .
62003001	( See what sort of love the Father has given to us : that we should be called God’s children – and indeed we are ! For this reason the world does not know us : because it did not know him .
62003002	Dear friends , we are God’s children now , and what we will be has not yet been revealed . We know that whenever it is revealed we will be like him , because we will see him just as he is .
62003003	And everyone who has this hope focused on him purifies himself , just as Jesus is pure ) .
62003004	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness ; indeed , sin is lawlessness .
62003005	And you know that Jesus was revealed to take away sins , and in him there is no sin .
62003006	Everyone who resides in him does not sin ; everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him .
62003007	Little children , let no one deceive you : The one who practices righteousness is righteous , just as Jesus is righteous .
62003008	The one who practices sin is of the devil , because the devil has been sinning from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was revealed : to destroy the works of the devil .
62003009	Everyone who has been fathered by God does not practice sin , because God’s seed resides in him , and thus he is not able to sin , because he has been fathered by God .
62003010	By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed : Everyone who does not practice righteousness – the one who does not love his fellow Christian – is not of God .
62003011	For this is the gospel message that you have heard from the beginning : that we should love one another ,
62003012	not like Cain who was of the evil one and brutally murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because his deeds were evil , but his brother’s were righteous .
62003013	Therefore do not be surprised , brothers and sisters , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have crossed over from death to life because we love our fellow Christians . The one who does not love remains in death .
62003015	Everyone who hates his fellow Christian is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him .
62003016	We have come to know love by this : that Jesus laid down his life for us ; thus we ought to lay down our lives for our fellow Christians .
62003017	But whoever has the world’s possessions and sees his fellow Christian in need and shuts off his compassion against him , how can the love of God reside in such a person ?
62003018	Little children , let us not love with word or with tongue but in deed and truth .
62003019	And by this we will know that we are of the truth and will convince our conscience in his presence ,
62003020	that if our conscience condemns us , that God is greater than our conscience and knows all things .
62003021	Dear friends , if our conscience does not condemn us , we have confidence in the presence of God ,
62003022	and whatever we ask we receive from him , because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing to him .
62003023	Now this is his commandment : that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another , just as he gave us the commandment .
62003024	And the person who keeps his commandments resides in God , and God in him . Now by this we know that God resides in us : by the Spirit he has given us .
62004001	Dear friends , do not believe every spirit , but test the spirits to determine if they are from God , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	By this you know the Spirit of God : Every spirit that confesses Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh is from God ,
62004003	but every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God , and this is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming , and now is already in the world .
62004004	You are from God , little children , and have conquered them , because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world .
62004005	They are from the world ; therefore they speak from the world’s perspective and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are from God ; the person who knows God listens to us , but whoever is not from God does not listen to us . By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit .
62004007	Dear friends , let us love one another , because love is from God , and everyone who loves has been fathered by God and knows God .
62004008	The person who does not love does not know God , because God is love .
62004009	By this the love of God is revealed in us : that God has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may live through him .
62004010	In this is love : not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
62004011	Dear friends , if God so loved us , then we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has seen God at any time . If we love one another , God resides in us , and his love is perfected in us .
62004013	By this we know that we reside in God and he in us : in that he has given us of his Spirit .
62004014	And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world .
62004015	If anyone confesses that Jesus is the Son of God , God resides in him and he in God .
62004016	And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has in us . God is love , and the one who resides in love resides in God , and God resides in him .
62004017	By this love is perfected with us , so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment , because just as Jesus is , so also are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love , but perfect love drives out fear , because fear has to do with punishment . The one who fears punishment has not been perfected in love .
62004019	We love because he loved us first .
62004020	If anyone says “ I love God ” and yet hates his fellow Christian , he is a liar , because the one who does not love his fellow Christian whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen .
62004021	And the commandment we have from him is this : that the one who loves God should love his fellow Christian too .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been fathered by God , and everyone who loves the father loves the child fathered by him .
62005002	By this we know that we love the children of God : whenever we love God and obey his commandments .
62005003	For this is the love of God : that we keep his commandments . And his commandments do not weigh us down ,
62005004	because everyone who has been fathered by God conquers the world . This is the conquering power that has conquered the world : our faith .
62005005	Now who is the person who has conquered the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62005006	Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood – not by the water only , but by the water and the blood . And the Spirit is the one who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005007	For there are three that testify ,
62005008	the Spirit and the water and the blood , and these three are in agreement .
62005009	If we accept the testimony of men , the testimony of God is greater , because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son .
62005010	( The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself ; the one who does not believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son . )
62005011	And this is the testimony : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	The one who has the Son has this eternal life ; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have this eternal life .
62005013	I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life .
62005014	And this is the confidence that we have before him : that whenever we ask anything according to his will , he hears us .
62005015	And if we know that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask , then we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him .
62005016	If anyone sees his fellow Christian committing a sin not resulting in death , he should ask , and God will grant life to the person who commits a sin not resulting in death . There is a sin resulting in death . I do not say that he should ask about that .
62005017	All unrighteousness is sin , but there is sin not resulting in death .
62005018	We know that everyone fathered by God does not sin , but God protects the one he has fathered , and the evil one cannot touch him .
62005019	We know that we are from God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
62005020	And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us insight to know him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . This one is the true God and eternal life .
62005021	Little children , guard yourselves from idols .
63001001	From the elder , to an elect lady and her children , whom I love in truth ( and not I alone , but also all those who know the truth ) ,
63001002	because of the truth that resides in us and will be with us forever .
63001003	Grace , mercy , and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
63001004	I rejoiced greatly because I have found some of your children living according to the truth , just as the Father commanded us .
63001005	But now I ask you , lady ( not as if I were writing a new commandment to you , but the one we have had from the beginning ) , that we love one another .
63001006	( Now this is love : that we walk according to his commandments . ) This is the commandment , just as you have heard from the beginning ; thus you should walk in it .
63001007	For many deceivers have gone out into the world , people who do not confess Jesus as Christ coming in the flesh . This person is the deceiver and the antichrist !
63001008	Watch out , so that you do not lose the things we have worked for , but receive a full reward .
63001009	Everyone who goes on ahead and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God . The one who remains in this teaching has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not receive him into your house and do not give him any greeting ,
63001011	because the person who gives him a greeting shares in his evil deeds .
63001012	Though I have many other things to write to you , I do not want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come visit you and speak face to face , so that our joy may be complete .
63001013	The children of your elect sister greet you .
64001001	From the elder , to Gaius my dear brother , whom I love in truth .
64001002	Dear friend , I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health , just as it is well with your soul .
64001003	For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth , just as you are living according to the truth .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this : to hear that my children are living according to the truth .
64001005	Dear friend , you demonstrate faithfulness by whatever you do for the brothers ( even though they are strangers ) .
64001006	They have testified to your love before the church . You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God .
64001007	For they have gone forth on behalf of “ The Name , ” accepting nothing from the pagans .
64001008	Therefore we ought to support such people , so that we become coworkers in cooperation with the truth .
64001009	I wrote something to the church , but Diotrephes , who loves to be first among them , does not acknowledge us .
64001010	Therefore , if I come , I will call attention to the deeds he is doing – the bringing of unjustified charges against us with evil words ! And not being content with that , he not only refuses to welcome the brothers himself , but hinders the people who want to do so and throws them out of the church !
64001011	Dear friend , do not imitate what is bad but what is good . The one who does good is of God ; the one who does what is bad has not seen God .
64001012	Demetrius has been testified to by all , even by the truth itself . We also testify to him , and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I have many things to write to you , but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink .
64001014	But I hope to see you right away , and we will speak face to face .
64001015	Peace be with you . The friends here greet you . Greet the friends there by name .
65001001	From Jude , a slave of Jesus Christ and brother of James , to those who are called , wrapped in the love of God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ .
65001002	May mercy , peace , and love be lavished on you !
65001003	Dear friends , although I have been eager to write to you about our common salvation , I now feel compelled instead to write to encourage you to contend earnestly for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints .
65001004	For certain men have secretly slipped in among you – men who long ago were marked out for the condemnation I am about to describe – ungodly men who have turned the grace of our God into a license for evil and who deny our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65001005	Now I desire to remind you ( even though you have been fully informed of these facts once for all ) that Jesus , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , later destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	You also know that the angels who did not keep within their proper domain but abandoned their own place of residence , he has kept in eternal chains in utter darkness , locked up for the judgment of the great Day .
65001007	So also Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring towns , since they indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire in a way similar to these angels , are now displayed as an example by suffering the punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	Yet these men , as a result of their dreams , defile the flesh , reject authority , and insult the glorious ones .
65001009	But even when Michael the archangel was arguing with the devil and debating with him concerning Moses’ body , he did not dare to bring a slanderous judgment , but said , “ May the Lord rebuke you ! ”
65001010	But these men do not understand the things they slander , and they are being destroyed by the very things that , like irrational animals , they instinctively comprehend .
65001011	Woe to them ! For they have traveled down Cain’s path , and because of greed have abandoned themselves to Balaam’s error ; hence , they will certainly perish in Korah’s rebellion .
65001012	These men are dangerous reefs at your love feasts , feasting without reverence , feeding only themselves . They are waterless clouds , carried along by the winds ; autumn trees without fruit – twice dead , uprooted ;
65001013	wild sea waves , spewing out the foam of their shame ; wayward stars for whom the utter depths of eternal darkness have been reserved .
65001014	Now Enoch , the seventh in descent beginning with Adam , even prophesied of them , saying , “ Look ! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy ones ,
65001015	to execute judgment on all , and to convict every person of all their thoroughly ungodly deeds that they have committed , and of all the harsh words that ungodly sinners have spoken against him . ”
65001016	These people are grumblers and fault-finders who go wherever their desires lead them , and they give bombastic speeches , enchanting folks for their own gain .
65001017	But you , dear friends – recall the predictions foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001018	For they said to you , “ In the end time there will come scoffers , propelled by their own ungodly desires . ”
65001019	These people are divisive , worldly , devoid of the Spirit .
65001020	But you , dear friends , by building yourselves up in your most holy faith , by praying in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	maintain yourselves in the love of God , while anticipating the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that brings eternal life .
65001022	And have mercy on those who waver ;
65001023	save others by snatching them out of the fire ; have mercy on others , coupled with a fear of God , hating even the clothes stained by the flesh .
65001024	Now to the one who is able to keep you from falling , and to cause you to stand , rejoicing , without blemish before his glorious presence ,
65001025	to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory , majesty , power , and authority , before all time , and now , and for all eternity . Amen .
66001001	The revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show his servants what must happen very soon . He made it clear by sending his angel to his servant John ,
66001002	who then testified to everything that he saw concerning the word of God and the testimony about Jesus Christ .
66001003	Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy aloud , and blessed are those who hear and obey the things written in it , because the time is near !
66001004	From John , to the seven churches that are in the province of Asia : Grace and peace to you from “ he who is , ” and who was , and who is still to come , and from the seven spirits who are before his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ – the faithful witness , the firstborn from among the dead , the ruler over the kings of the earth . To the one who loves us and has set us free from our sins at the cost of his own blood
66001006	and has appointed us as a kingdom , as priests serving his God and Father – to him be the glory and the power for ever and ever ! Amen .
66001007	( Look ! He is returning with the clouds , and every eye will see him , even those who pierced him , and all the tribes on the earth will mourn because of him . This will certainly come to pass ! Amen . )
66001008	“ I am the Alpha and the Omega , ” says the Lord God – the one who is , and who was , and who is still to come – the All-Powerful !
66001009	I , John , your brother and the one who shares with you in the persecution , kingdom , and endurance that are in Jesus , was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus .
66001010	I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day when I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet ,
66001011	saying : “ Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches – to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea . ”
66001012	I turned to see whose voice was speaking to me , and when I did so , I saw seven golden lampstands ,
66001013	and in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of man . He was dressed in a robe extending down to his feet and he wore a wide golden belt around his chest .
66001014	His head and hair were as white as wool , even as white as snow , and his eyes were like a fiery flame .
66001015	His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace , and his voice was like the roar of many waters .
66001016	He held seven stars in his right hand , and a sharp double-edged sword extended out of his mouth . His face shone like the sun shining at full strength .
66001017	When I saw him I fell down at his feet as though I were dead , but he placed his right hand on me and said : “ Do not be afraid ! I am the first and the last ,
66001018	and the one who lives ! I was dead , but look , now I am alive – forever and ever – and I hold the keys of death and of Hades !
66001019	Therefore write what you saw , what is , and what will be after these things .
66001020	The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands is this : The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .
66002001	“ To the angel of the church in Ephesus , write the following : “ This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who has a firm grasp on the seven stars in his right hand – the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands :
66002002	‘ I know your works as well as your labor and steadfast endurance , and that you cannot tolerate evil . You have even put to the test those who refer to themselves as apostles ( but are not ) , and have discovered that they are false .
66002003	I am also aware that you have persisted steadfastly , endured much for the sake of my name , and have not grown weary .
66002004	But I have this against you : You have departed from your first love !
66002005	Therefore , remember from what high state you have fallen and repent ! Do the deeds you did at the first ; if not , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place – that is , if you do not repent .
66002006	But you do have this going for you : You hate what the Nicolaitans practice – practices I also hate .
66002007	The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To the one who conquers , I will permit him to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God . ’
66002008	“ To the angel of the church in Smyrna write the following : “ This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who is the first and the last , the one who was dead , but came to life :
66002009	‘ I know the distress you are suffering and your poverty ( but you are rich ) . I also know the slander against you by those who call themselves Jews and really are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer . The devil is about to have some of you thrown into prison so you may be tested , and you will experience suffering for ten days . Remain faithful even to the point of death , and I will give you the crown that is life itself .
66002011	The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches . The one who conquers will in no way be harmed by the second death . ’
66002012	“ To the angel of the church in Pergamum write the following : “ This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who has the sharp double-edged sword :
66002013	‘ I know where you live – where Satan’s throne is . Yet you continue to cling to my name and you have not denied your faith in me , even in the days of Antipas , my faithful witness , who was killed in your city where Satan lives .
66002014	But I have a few things against you : You have some people there who follow the teaching of Balaam , who instructed Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality .
66002015	In the same way , there are also some among you who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	Therefore , repent ! If not , I will come against you quickly and make war against those people with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To the one who conquers , I will give him some of the hidden manna , and I will give him a white stone , and on that stone will be written a new name that no one can understand except the one who receives it . ’
66002018	“ To the angel of the church in Thyatira write the following : “ This is the solemn pronouncement of the Son of God , the one who has eyes like a fiery flame and whose feet are like polished bronze :
66002019	‘ I know your deeds : your love , faith , service , and steadfast endurance . In fact , your more recent deeds are greater than your earlier ones .
66002020	But I have this against you : You tolerate that woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , and by her teaching deceives my servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I have given her time to repent , but she is not willing to repent of her sexual immorality .
66002022	Look ! I am throwing her onto a bed of violent illness , and those who commit adultery with her into terrible suffering , unless they repent of her deeds .
66002023	Furthermore , I will strike her followers with a deadly disease , and then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts . I will repay each one of you what your deeds deserve .
66002024	But to the rest of you in Thyatira , all who do not hold to this teaching ( who have not learned the so-called “ deep secrets of Satan ” ) , to you I say : I do not put any additional burden on you .
66002025	However , hold on to what you have until I come .
66002026	And to the one who conquers and who continues in my deeds until the end , I will give him authority over the nations –
66002027	he will rule them with an iron rod and like clay jars he will break them to pieces ,
66002028	just as I have received the right to rule from my Father – and I will give him the morning star .
66002029	The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’
66003001	“ To the angel of the church in Sardis write the following : “ This is the solemn pronouncement of the one who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars : ‘ I know your deeds , that you have a reputation that you are alive , but in reality you are dead .
66003002	Wake up then , and strengthen what remains that was about to die , because I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God .
66003003	Therefore , remember what you received and heard , and obey it , and repent . If you do not wake up , I will come like a thief , and you will never know at what hour I will come against you .
66003004	But you have a few individuals in Sardis who have not stained their clothes , and they will walk with me dressed in white , because they are worthy .
66003005	The one who conquers will be dressed like them in white clothing , and I will never erase his name from the book of life , but will declare his name before my Father and before his angels .
66003006	The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’
66003007	“ To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write the following : “ This is the solemn pronouncement of the Holy One , the True One , who holds the key of David , who opens doors no one can shut , and shuts doors no one can open :
66003008	‘ I know your deeds . ( Look ! I have put in front of you an open door that no one can shut . ) I know that you have little strength , but you have obeyed my word and have not denied my name .
66003009	Listen ! I am going to make those people from the synagogue of Satan – who say they are Jews yet are not , but are lying – Look , I will make them come and bow down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you .
66003010	Because you have kept my admonition to endure steadfastly , I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is about to come on the whole world to test those who live on the earth .
66003011	I am coming soon . Hold on to what you have so that no one can take away your crown .
66003012	The one who conquers I will make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he will never depart from it . I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God ( the new Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from my God ) , and my new name as well .
66003013	The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’
66003014	“ To the angel of the church in Laodicea write the following : “ This is the solemn pronouncement of the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the originator of God’s creation :
66003015	‘ I know your deeds , that you are neither cold nor hot . I wish you were either cold or hot !
66003016	So because you are lukewarm , and neither hot nor cold , I am going to vomit you out of my mouth !
66003017	Because you say , “ I am rich and have acquired great wealth , and need nothing , ” but do not realize that you are wretched , pitiful , poor , blind , and naked ,
66003018	take my advice and buy gold from me refined by fire so you can become rich ! Buy from me white clothing so you can be clothed and your shameful nakedness will not be exposed , and buy eye salve to put on your eyes so you can see !
66003019	All those I love , I rebuke and discipline . So be earnest and repent !
66003020	Listen ! I am standing at the door and knocking ! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door I will come into his home and share a meal with him , and he with me .
66003021	I will grant the one who conquers permission to sit with me on my throne , just as I too conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	The one who has an ear had better hear what the Spirit says to the churches . ’ ”
66004001	After these things I looked , and there was a door standing open in heaven ! And the first voice I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said : “ Come up here so that I can show you what must happen after these things . ”
66004002	Immediately I was in the Spirit , and a throne was standing in heaven with someone seated on it !
66004003	And the one seated on it was like jasper and carnelian in appearance , and a rainbow looking like it was made of emerald encircled the throne .
66004004	In a circle around the throne were twenty-four other thrones , and seated on those thrones were twenty-four elders . They were dressed in white clothing and had golden crowns on their heads .
66004005	From the throne came out flashes of lightning and roaring and crashes of thunder . Seven flaming torches , which are the seven spirits of God , were burning in front of the throne
66004006	and in front of the throne was something like a sea of glass , like crystal . In the middle of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back .
66004007	The first living creature was like a lion , the second creature like an ox , the third creature had a face like a man’s , and the fourth creature looked like an eagle flying .
66004008	Each one of the four living creatures had six wings and was full of eyes all around and inside . They never rest day or night , saying : “ Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God , the All-Powerful , Who was and who is , and who is still to come ! ”
66004009	And whenever the living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to the one who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders throw themselves to the ground before the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever , and they offer their crowns before his throne , saying :
66004011	“ You are worthy , our Lord and God , to receive glory and honor and power , since you created all things , and because of your will they existed and were created ! ”
66005001	Then I saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the front and back and sealed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming in a loud voice : “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals ? ”
66005003	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it .
66005004	So I began weeping bitterly because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , “ Stop weeping ! Look , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the root of David , has conquered ; thus he can open the scroll and its seven seals . ”
66005006	Then I saw standing in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the middle of the elders , a Lamb that appeared to have been killed . He had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth .
66005007	Then he came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne ,
66005008	and when he had taken the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders threw themselves to the ground before the Lamb . Each of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense ( which are the prayers of the saints ) .
66005009	They were singing a new song : “ You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were killed , and at the cost of your own blood you have purchased for God persons from every tribe , language , people , and nation .
66005010	You have appointed them as a kingdom and priests to serve our God , and they will reign on the earth . ”
66005011	Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels in a circle around the throne , as well as the living creatures and the elders . Their number was ten thousand times ten thousand – thousands times thousands –
66005012	all of whom were singing in a loud voice : “ Worthy is the lamb who was killed to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and praise ! ”
66005013	Then I heard every creature – in heaven , on earth , under the earth , in the sea , and all that is in them – singing : “ To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb be praise , honor , glory , and ruling power forever and ever ! ”
66005014	And the four living creatures were saying “ Amen , ” and the elders threw themselves to the ground and worshiped .
66006001	I looked on when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a thunderous voice , “ Come ! ”
66006002	So I looked , and here came a white horse ! The one who rode it had a bow , and he was given a crown , and as a conqueror he rode out to conquer .
66006003	Then when the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature saying , “ Come ! ”
66006004	And another horse , fiery red , came out , and the one who rode it was granted permission to take peace from the earth , so that people would butcher one another , and he was given a huge sword .
66006005	Then when the Lamb opened the third seal I heard the third living creature saying , “ Come ! ” So I looked , and here came a black horse ! The one who rode it had a balance scale in his hand .
66006006	Then I heard something like a voice from among the four living creatures saying , “ A quart of wheat will cost a day’s pay and three quarts of barley will cost a day’s pay . But do not damage the olive oil and the wine ! ”
66006007	Then when the Lamb opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying , “ Come ! ”
66006008	So I looked and here came a pale green horse ! The name of the one who rode it was Death , and Hades followed right behind . They were given authority over a fourth of the earth , to kill its population with the sword , famine , and disease , and by the wild animals of the earth .
66006009	Now when the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been violently killed because of the word of God and because of the testimony they had given .
66006010	They cried out with a loud voice , “ How long , Sovereign Master , holy and true , before you judge those who live on the earth and avenge our blood ? ”
66006011	Each of them was given a long white robe and they were told to rest for a little longer , until the full number was reached of both their fellow servants and their brothers who were going to be killed just as they had been .
66006012	Then I looked when the Lamb opened the sixth seal , and a huge earthquake took place ; the sun became as black as sackcloth made of hair , and the full moon became blood red ;
66006013	and the stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when shaken by a fierce wind .
66006014	The sky was split apart like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth , the very important people , the generals , the rich , the powerful , and everyone , slave and free , hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
66006016	They said to the mountains and to the rocks , “ Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb ,
66006017	because the great day of their wrath has come , and who is able to withstand it ? ”
66007001	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds of the earth so no wind could blow on the earth , on the sea , or on any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel ascending from the east , who had the seal of the living God . He shouted out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given permission to damage the earth and the sea :
66007003	“ Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God . ”
66007004	Now I heard the number of those who were marked with the seal , one hundred and forty-four thousand , sealed from all the tribes of the people of Israel :
66007005	From the tribe of Judah , twelve thousand were sealed , from the tribe of Reuben , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Gad , twelve thousand ,
66007006	from the tribe of Asher , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Naphtali , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand ,
66007007	from the tribe of Simeon , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Levi , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand ,
66007008	from the tribe of Zebulun , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Joseph , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Benjamin , twelve thousand were sealed .
66007009	After these things I looked , and here was an enormous crowd that no one could count , made up of persons from every nation , tribe , people , and language , standing before the throne and before the Lamb dressed in long white robes , and with palm branches in their hands .
66007010	They were shouting out in a loud voice , “ Salvation belongs to our God , to the one seated on the throne , and to the Lamb ! ”
66007011	And all the angels stood there in a circle around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures , and they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground before the throne and worshiped God ,
66007012	saying , “ Amen ! Praise and glory , and wisdom and thanksgiving , and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever . Amen ! ”
66007013	Then one of the elders asked me , “ These dressed in long white robes – who are they and where have they come from ? ”
66007014	So I said to him , “ My lord , you know the answer . ” Then he said to me , “ These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation . They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb !
66007015	For this reason they are before the throne of God , and they serve him day and night in his temple , and the one seated on the throne will shelter them .
66007016	They will never go hungry or be thirsty again , and the sun will not beat down on them , nor any burning heat ,
66007017	because the Lamb in the middle of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of living water , and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . ”
66008001	Now when the Lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel holding a golden censer came and was stationed at the altar . A large amount of incense was given to him to offer up , with the prayers of all the saints , on the golden altar that is before the throne .
66008004	The smoke coming from the incense , along with the prayers of the saints , ascended before God from the angel’s hand .
66008005	Then the angel took the censer , filled it with fire from the altar , and threw it on the earth , and there were crashes of thunder , roaring , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake .
66008006	Now the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow them .
66008007	The first angel blew his trumpet , and there was hail and fire mixed with blood , and it was thrown at the earth so that a third of the earth was burned up , a third of the trees were burned up , and all the green grass was burned up .
66008008	Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something like a great mountain of burning fire was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea became blood ,
66008009	and a third of the creatures living in the sea died , and a third of the ships were completely destroyed .
66008010	Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a huge star burning like a torch fell from the sky ; it landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
66008011	( Now the name of the star is Wormwood . ) So a third of the waters became wormwood , and many people died from these waters because they were poisoned .
66008012	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun was struck , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that a third of them were darkened . And there was no light for a third of the day and for a third of the night likewise .
66008013	Then I looked , and I heard an eagle flying directly overhead , proclaiming with a loud voice , “ Woe ! Woe ! Woe to those who live on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets of the three angels who are about to blow them ! ”
66009001	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth , and he was given the key to the shaft of the abyss .
66009002	He opened the shaft of the abyss and smoke rose out of it like smoke from a giant furnace . The sun and the air were darkened with smoke from the shaft .
66009003	Then out of the smoke came locusts onto the earth , and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth .
66009004	They were told not to damage the grass of the earth , or any green plant or tree , but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their forehead .
66009005	The locusts were not given permission to kill them , but only to torture them for five months , and their torture was like that of a scorpion when it stings a person .
66009006	In those days people will seek death , but will not be able to find it ; they will long to die , but death will flee from them .
66009007	Now the locusts looked like horses equipped for battle . On their heads were something like crowns similar to gold , and their faces looked like men’s faces .
66009008	They had hair like women’s hair , and their teeth were like lions’ teeth .
66009009	They had breastplates like iron breastplates , and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots charging into battle .
66009010	They have tails and stingers like scorpions , and their ability to injure people for five months is in their tails .
66009011	They have as king over them the angel of the abyss , whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in Greek , Apollyon .
66009012	The first woe has passed , but two woes are still coming after these things !
66009013	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a single voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God ,
66009014	saying to the sixth angel , the one holding the trumpet , “ Set free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates ! ”
66009015	Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour , day , month , and year were set free to kill a third of humanity .
66009016	The number of soldiers on horseback was two hundred million ; I heard their number .
66009017	Now this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision : The riders had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and sulfurous yellow in color . The heads of the horses looked like lions’ heads , and fire , smoke , and sulfur came out of their mouths .
66009018	A third of humanity was killed by these three plagues , that is , by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur that came out of their mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses resides in their mouths and in their tails , because their tails are like snakes , having heads that inflict injuries .
66009020	The rest of humanity , who had not been killed by these plagues , did not repent of the works of their hands , so that they did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood – idols that cannot see or hear or walk about .
66009021	Furthermore , they did not repent of their murders , of their magic spells , of their sexual immorality , or of their stealing .
66010001	Then I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven , wrapped in a cloud , with a rainbow above his head ; his face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire .
66010002	He held in his hand a little scroll that was open , and he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the land .
66010003	Then he shouted in a loud voice like a lion roaring , and when he shouted , the seven thunders sounded their voices .
66010004	When the seven thunders spoke , I was preparing to write , but just then I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Seal up what the seven thunders spoke and do not write it down . ”
66010005	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven
66010006	and swore by the one who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and what is in it , and the earth and what is in it , and the sea and what is in it , “ There will be no more delay !
66010007	But in the days when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet , the mystery of God is completed , just as he has proclaimed to his servants the prophets . ”
66010008	Then the voice I had heard from heaven began to speak to me again , “ Go and take the open scroll in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . ”
66010009	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll . He said to me , “ Take the scroll and eat it . It will make your stomach bitter , but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth . ”
66010010	So I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it , and it did taste as sweet as honey in my mouth , but when I had eaten it , my stomach became bitter .
66010011	Then they told me : “ You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings . ”
66011001	Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me , and I was told , “ Get up and measure the temple of God , and the altar , and the ones who worship there .
66011002	But do not measure the outer courtyard of the temple ; leave it out , because it has been given to the Gentiles , and they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months .
66011003	And I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for 1,260 days , dressed in sackcloth .
66011004	( These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth . )
66011005	If anyone wants to harm them , fire comes out of their mouths and completely consumes their enemies . If anyone wants to harm them , they must be killed this way .
66011006	These two have the power to close up the sky so that it does not rain during the time they are prophesying . They have power to turn the waters to blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague whenever they want .
66011007	When they have completed their testimony , the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war on them and conquer them and kill them .
66011008	Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city that is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt , where their Lord was also crucified .
66011009	For three and a half days those from every people , tribe , nation , and language will look at their corpses , because they will not permit them to be placed in a tomb .
66011010	And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate , even sending gifts to each other , because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth .
66011011	But after three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them , and they stood on their feet , and tremendous fear seized those who were watching them .
66011012	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them : “ Come up here ! ” So the two prophets went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies stared at them .
66011013	Just then a major earthquake took place and a tenth of the city collapsed ; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second woe has come and gone ; the third is coming quickly .
66011015	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet , and there were loud voices in heaven saying : “ The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ , and he will reign for ever and ever . ”
66011016	Then the twenty-four elders who are seated on their thrones before God threw themselves down with their faces to the ground and worshiped God
66011017	with these words : “ We give you thanks , Lord God , the All-Powerful , the one who is and who was , because you have taken your great power and begun to reign .
66011018	The nations were enraged , but your wrath has come , and the time has come for the dead to be judged , and the time has come to give to your servants , the prophets , their reward , as well as to the saints and to those who revere your name , both small and great , and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth . ”
66011019	Then the temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was visible within his temple . And there were flashes of lightning , roaring , crashes of thunder , an earthquake , and a great hailstorm .
66012001	Then a great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , and with the moon under her feet , and on her head was a crown of twelve stars .
66012002	She was pregnant and was screaming in labor pains , struggling to give birth .
66012003	Then another sign appeared in heaven : a huge red dragon that had seven heads and ten horns , and on its heads were seven diadem crowns .
66012004	Now the dragon’s tail swept away a third of the stars in heaven and hurled them to the earth . Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born .
66012005	So the woman gave birth to a son , a male child , who is going to rule over all the nations with an iron rod . Her child was suddenly caught up to God and to his throne ,
66012006	and she fled into the wilderness where a place had been prepared for her by God , so she could be taken care of for 1,260 days .
66012007	Then war broke out in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
66012008	But the dragon was not strong enough to prevail , so there was no longer any place left in heaven for him and his angels .
66012009	So that huge dragon – the ancient serpent , the one called the devil and Satan , who deceives the whole world – was thrown down to the earth , and his angels along with him .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying , “ The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God , and the ruling authority of his Christ , have now come , because the accuser of our brothers and sisters , the one who accuses them day and night before our God , has been thrown down .
66012011	But they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony , and they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid to die .
66012012	Therefore you heavens rejoice , and all who reside in them ! But woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you ! He is filled with terrible anger , for he knows that he only has a little time ! ”
66012013	Now when the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth , he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child .
66012014	But the woman was given the two wings of a giant eagle so that she could fly out into the wilderness , to the place God prepared for her , where she is taken care of – away from the presence of the serpent – for a time , times , and half a time .
66012015	Then the serpent spouted water like a river out of his mouth after the woman in an attempt to sweep her away by a flood ,
66012016	but the earth came to her rescue ; the ground opened up and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth .
66012017	So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her children , those who keep God’s commandments and hold to the testimony about Jesus .
66013001	And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore . Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads , and on its horns were ten diadem crowns , and on its heads a blasphemous name .
66013002	Now the beast that I saw was like a leopard , but its feet were like a bear’s , and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth . The dragon gave the beast his power , his throne , and great authority to rule .
66013003	One of the beast’s heads appeared to have been killed , but the lethal wound had been healed . And the whole world followed the beast in amazement ;
66013004	they worshiped the dragon because he had given ruling authority to the beast , and they worshiped the beast too , saying : “ Who is like the beast ? ” and “ Who is able to make war against him ? ”
66013005	The beast was given a mouth speaking proud words and blasphemies , and he was permitted to exercise ruling authority for forty-two months .
66013006	So the beast opened his mouth to blaspheme against God – to blaspheme both his name and his dwelling place , that is , those who dwell in heaven .
66013007	The beast was permitted to go to war against the saints and conquer them . He was given ruling authority over every tribe , people , language , and nation ,
66013008	and all those who live on the earth will worship the beast , everyone whose name has not been written since the foundation of the world in the book of life belonging to the Lamb who was killed .
66013009	If anyone has an ear , he had better listen !
66013010	If anyone is meant for captivity , into captivity he will go . If anyone is to be killed by the sword , then by the sword he must be killed . This requires steadfast endurance and faith from the saints .
66013011	Then I saw another beast coming up from the earth . He had two horns like a lamb , but was speaking like a dragon .
66013012	He exercised all the ruling authority of the first beast on his behalf , and made the earth and those who inhabit it worship the first beast , the one whose lethal wound had been healed .
66013013	He performed momentous signs , even making fire come down from heaven in front of people
66013014	and , by the signs he was permitted to perform on behalf of the beast , he deceived those who live on the earth . He told those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who had been wounded by the sword , but still lived .
66013015	The second beast was empowered to give life to the image of the first beast so that it could speak , and could cause all those who did not worship the image of the beast to be killed .
66013016	He also caused everyone ( small and great , rich and poor , free and slave ) to obtain a mark on their right hand or on their forehead .
66013017	Thus no one was allowed to buy or sell things unless he bore the mark of the beast – that is , his name or his number .
66013018	This calls for wisdom : Let the one who has insight calculate the beast’s number , for it is man’s number , and his number is 666 .
66014001	Then I looked , and here was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion , and with him were one hundred and forty-four thousand , who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads .
66014002	I also heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder . Now the sound I heard was like that made by harpists playing their harps ,
66014003	and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one was able to learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth .
66014004	These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women , for they are virgins . These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . These were redeemed from humanity as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb ,
66014005	and no lie was found on their lips ; they are blameless .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead , and he had an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth – to every nation , tribe , language , and people .
66014007	He declared in a loud voice : “ Fear God and give him glory , because the hour of his judgment has arrived , and worship the one who made heaven and earth , the sea and the springs of water ! ”
66014008	A second angel followed the first , declaring : “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great city ! She made all the nations drink of the wine of her immoral passion . ”
66014009	A third angel followed the first two , declaring in a loud voice : “ If anyone worships the beast and his image , and takes the mark on his forehead or his hand ,
66014010	that person will also drink of the wine of God’s anger that has been mixed undiluted in the cup of his wrath , and he will be tortured with fire and sulfur in front of the holy angels and in front of the Lamb .
66014011	And the smoke from their torture will go up forever and ever , and those who worship the beast and his image will have no rest day or night , along with anyone who receives the mark of his name . ”
66014012	This requires the steadfast endurance of the saints – those who obey God’s commandments and hold to their faith in Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Write this : ‘ Blessed are the dead , those who die in the Lord from this moment on ! ’ ” “ Yes , ” says the Spirit , “ so they can rest from their hard work , because their deeds will follow them . ”
66014014	Then I looked , and a white cloud appeared , and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man ! He had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	Then another angel came out of the temple , shouting in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud , “ Use your sickle and start to reap , because the time to reap has come , since the earth’s harvest is ripe ! ”
66014016	So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was reaped .
66014017	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he too had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Another angel , who was in charge of the fire , came from the altar and called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle , “ Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes off the vine of the earth , because its grapes are now ripe . ”
66014019	So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vineyard of the earth and tossed them into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
66014020	Then the winepress was stomped outside the city , and blood poured out of the winepress up to the height of horses’ bridles for a distance of almost two hundred miles .
66015001	Then I saw another great and astounding sign in heaven : seven angels who have seven final plagues ( they are final because in them God’s anger is completed ) .
66015002	Then I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire , and those who had conquered the beast and his image and the number of his name . They were standing by the sea of glass , holding harps given to them by God .
66015003	They sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb : “ Great and astounding are your deeds , Lord God , the All-Powerful ! Just and true are your ways , King over the nations !
66015004	Who will not fear you , O Lord , and glorify your name , because you alone are holy ? All nations will come and worship before you for your righteous acts have been revealed . ”
66015005	After these things I looked , and the temple ( the tent of the testimony ) was opened in heaven ,
66015006	and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple , dressed in clean bright linen , wearing wide golden belts around their chests .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever ,
66015008	and the temple was filled with smoke from God’s glory and from his power . Thus no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues from the seven angels were completed .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple declaring to the seven angels : “ Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls containing God’s wrath . ”
66016002	So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth . Then ugly and painful sores appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image .
66016003	Next , the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it turned into blood , like that of a corpse , and every living creature that was in the sea died .
66016004	Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water , and they turned into blood .
66016005	Now I heard the angel of the waters saying : “ You are just – the one who is and who was , the Holy One – because you have passed these judgments ,
66016006	because they poured out the blood of your saints and prophets , so you have given them blood to drink . They got what they deserved ! ”
66016007	Then I heard the altar reply , “ Yes , Lord God , the All-Powerful , your judgments are true and just ! ”
66016008	Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was permitted to scorch people with fire .
66016009	Thus people were scorched by the terrible heat , yet they blasphemed the name of God , who has ruling authority over these plagues , and they would not repent and give him glory .
66016010	Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast so that darkness covered his kingdom , and people began to bite their tongues because of their pain .
66016011	They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their sufferings and because of their sores , but nevertheless they still refused to repent of their deeds .
66016012	Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates and dried up its water to prepare the way for the kings from the east .
66016013	Then I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon , out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
66016014	For they are the spirits of the demons performing signs who go out to the kings of the earth to bring them together for the battle that will take place on the great day of God , the All-Powerful .
66016015	( Look ! I will come like a thief ! Blessed is the one who stays alert and does not lose his clothes so that he will not have to walk around naked and his shameful condition be seen . )
66016016	Now the spirits gathered the kings and their armies to the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew .
66016017	Finally the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne , saying : “ It is done ! ”
66016018	Then there were flashes of lightning , roaring , and crashes of thunder , and there was a tremendous earthquake – an earthquake unequaled since humanity has been on the earth , so tremendous was that earthquake .
66016019	The great city was split into three parts and the cities of the nations collapsed . So Babylon the great was remembered before God , and was given the cup filled with the wine made of God’s furious wrath .
66016020	Every island fled away and no mountains could be found .
66016021	And gigantic hailstones , weighing about a hundred pounds each , fell from heaven on people , but they blasphemed God because of the plague of hail , since it was so horrendous .
66017001	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me . “ Come , ” he said , “ I will show you the condemnation and punishment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters ,
66017002	with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and the earth’s inhabitants got drunk with the wine of her immorality . ”
66017003	So he carried me away in the Spirit to a wilderness , and there I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	Now the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet clothing , and adorned with gold , precious stones , and pearls . She held in her hand a golden cup filled with detestable things and unclean things from her sexual immorality .
66017005	On her forehead was written a name , a mystery : “ Babylon the Great , the Mother of prostitutes and of the detestable things of the earth . ”
66017006	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of those who testified to Jesus . I was greatly astounded when I saw her .
66017007	But the angel said to me , “ Why are you astounded ? I will interpret for you the mystery of the woman and of the beast with the seven heads and ten horns that carries her .
66017008	The beast you saw was , and is not , but is about to come up from the abyss and then go to destruction . The inhabitants of the earth – all those whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the world – will be astounded when they see that the beast was , and is not , but is to come .
66017009	( This requires a mind that has wisdom . ) The seven heads are seven mountains the woman sits on . They are also seven kings :
66017010	five have fallen ; one is , and the other has not yet come , but whenever he does come , he must remain for only a brief time .
66017011	The beast that was , and is not , is himself an eighth king and yet is one of the seven , and is going to destruction .
66017012	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom , but will receive ruling authority as kings with the beast for one hour .
66017013	These kings have a single intent , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will make war with the Lamb , but the Lamb will conquer them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings , and those accompanying the Lamb are the called , chosen , and faithful . ”
66017015	Then the angel said to me , “ The waters you saw ( where the prostitute is seated ) are peoples , multitudes , nations , and languages .
66017016	The ten horns that you saw , and the beast – these will hate the prostitute and make her desolate and naked . They will consume her flesh and burn her up with fire .
66017017	For God has put into their minds to carry out his purpose by making a decision to give their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled .
66017018	As for the woman you saw , she is the great city that has sovereignty over the kings of the earth . ”
66018001	After these things I saw another angel , who possessed great authority , coming down out of heaven , and the earth was lit up by his radiance .
66018002	He shouted with a powerful voice : “ Fallen , fallen , is Babylon the great ! She has become a lair for demons , a haunt for every unclean spirit , a haunt for every unclean bird , a haunt for every unclean and detested beast .
66018003	For all the nations have fallen from the wine of her immoral passion , and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her , and the merchants of the earth have gotten rich from the power of her sensual behavior . ”
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying , “ Come out of her , my people , so you will not take part in her sins and so you will not receive her plagues ,
66018005	because her sins have piled up all the way to heaven and God has remembered her crimes .
66018006	Repay her the same way she repaid others ; pay her back double corresponding to her deeds . In the cup she mixed , mix double the amount for her .
66018007	As much as she exalted herself and lived in sensual luxury , to this extent give her torment and grief because she said to herself , ‘ I rule as queen and am no widow ; I will never experience grief ! ’
66018008	For this reason , she will experience her plagues in a single day : disease , mourning , and famine , and she will be burned down with fire , because the Lord God who judges her is powerful ! ”
66018009	Then the kings of the earth who committed immoral acts with her and lived in sensual luxury with her will weep and wail for her when they see the smoke from the fire that burns her up .
66018010	They will stand a long way off because they are afraid of her torment , and will say , “ Woe , woe , O great city , Babylon the powerful city ! For in a single hour your doom has come ! ”
66018011	Then the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her because no one buys their cargo any longer –
66018012	cargo such as gold , silver , precious stones , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , scarlet cloth , all sorts of things made of citron wood , all sorts of objects made of ivory , all sorts of things made of expensive wood , bronze , iron and marble ,
66018013	cinnamon , spice , incense , perfumed ointment , frankincense , wine , olive oil and costly flour , wheat , cattle and sheep , horses and four-wheeled carriages , slaves and human lives .
66018014	( The ripe fruit you greatly desired has gone from you , and all your luxury and splendor have gone from you – they will never ever be found again ! )
66018015	The merchants who sold these things , who got rich from her , will stand a long way off because they are afraid of her torment . They will weep and mourn ,
66018016	saying , “ Woe , woe , O great city – dressed in fine linen , purple and scarlet clothing , and adorned with gold , precious stones , and pearls –
66018017	because in a single hour such great wealth has been destroyed ! ” And every ship’s captain , and all who sail along the coast – seamen , and all who make their living from the sea , stood a long way off
66018018	and began to shout when they saw the smoke from the fire that burned her up , “ Who is like the great city ? ”
66018019	And they threw dust on their heads and were shouting with weeping and mourning , “ Woe , Woe , O great city – in which all those who had ships on the sea got rich from her wealth – because in a single hour she has been destroyed ! ”
66018020	( Rejoice over her , O heaven , and you saints and apostles and prophets , for God has pronounced judgment against her on your behalf ! )
66018021	Then one powerful angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone , threw it into the sea , and said , “ With this kind of sudden violent force Babylon the great city will be thrown down and it will never be found again !
66018022	And the sound of the harpists , musicians , flute players , and trumpeters will never be heard in you again . No craftsman who practices any trade will ever be found in you again ; the noise of a mill will never be heard in you again .
66018023	Even the light from a lamp will never shine in you again ! The voices of the bridegroom and his bride will never be heard in you again . For your merchants were the tycoons of the world , because all the nations were deceived by your magic spells !
66018024	The blood of the saints and prophets was found in her , along with the blood of all those who had been killed on the earth . ”
66019001	After these things I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a vast throng in heaven , saying , “ Hallelujah ! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God ,
66019002	because his judgments are true and just . For he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality , and has avenged the blood of his servants poured out by her own hands ! ”
66019003	Then a second time the crowd shouted , “ Hallelujah ! ” The smoke rises from her forever and ever .
66019004	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures threw themselves to the ground and worshiped God , who was seated on the throne , saying : “ Amen ! Hallelujah ! ”
66019005	Then a voice came from the throne , saying : “ Praise our God all you his servants , and all you who fear Him , both the small and the great ! ”
66019006	Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a vast throng , like the roar of many waters and like loud crashes of thunder . They were shouting : “ Hallelujah ! For the Lord our God , the All-Powerful , reigns !
66019007	Let us rejoice and exult and give him glory , because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come , and his bride has made herself ready .
66019008	She was permitted to be dressed in bright , clean , fine linen ” ( for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints ) .
66019009	Then the angel said to me , “ Write the following : Blessed are those who are invited to the banquet at the wedding celebration of the Lamb ! ” He also said to me , “ These are the true words of God . ”
66019010	So I threw myself down at his feet to worship him , but he said , “ Do not do this ! I am only a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony about Jesus . Worship God , for the testimony about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . ”
66019011	Then I saw heaven opened and here came a white horse ! The one riding it was called “ Faithful ” and “ True , ” and with justice he judges and goes to war .
66019012	His eyes are like a fiery flame and there are many diadem crowns on his head . He has a name written that no one knows except himself .
66019013	He is dressed in clothing dipped in blood , and he is called the Word of God .
66019014	The armies that are in heaven , dressed in white , clean , fine linen , were following him on white horses .
66019015	From his mouth extends a sharp sword , so that with it he can strike the nations . He will rule them with an iron rod , and he stomps the winepress of the furious wrath of God , the All-Powerful .
66019016	He has a name written on his clothing and on his thigh : “ King of kings and Lord of lords . ”
66019017	Then I saw one angel standing in the sun , and he shouted in a loud voice to all the birds flying high in the sky : “ Come , gather around for the great banquet of God ,
66019018	to eat your fill of the flesh of kings , the flesh of generals , the flesh of powerful people , the flesh of horses and those who ride them , and the flesh of all people , both free and slave , and small and great ! ”
66019019	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to do battle with the one who rode the horse and with his army .
66019020	Now the beast was seized , and along with him the false prophet who had performed the signs on his behalf – signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image . Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur .
66019021	The others were killed by the sword that extended from the mouth of the one who rode the horse , and all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh .
66020001	Then I saw an angel descending from heaven , holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a huge chain .
66020002	He seized the dragon – the ancient serpent , who is the devil and Satan – and tied him up for a thousand years .
66020003	The angel then threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it so that he could not deceive the nations until the one thousand years were finished . ( After these things he must be released for a brief period of time . )
66020004	Then I saw thrones and seated on them were those who had been given authority to judge . I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God . These had not worshiped the beast or his image and had refused to receive his mark on their forehead or hand . They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years .
66020005	( The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished . ) This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and holy is the one who takes part in the first resurrection . The second death has no power over them , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and they will reign with him for a thousand years .
66020007	Now when the thousand years are finished , Satan will be released from his prison
66020008	and will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to bring them together for the battle . They are as numerous as the grains of sand in the sea .
66020009	They went up on the broad plain of the earth and encircled the camp of the saints and the beloved city , but fire came down from heaven and devoured them completely .
66020010	And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are too , and they will be tormented there day and night forever and ever .
66020011	Then I saw a large white throne and the one who was seated on it ; the earth and the heaven fled from his presence , and no place was found for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , the great and the small , standing before the throne . Then books were opened , and another book was opened – the book of life . So the dead were judged by what was written in the books , according to their deeds .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead that were in it , and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them , and each one was judged according to his deeds .
66020014	Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death – the lake of fire .
66020015	If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life , that person was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth , for the first heaven and earth had ceased to exist , and the sea existed no more .
66021002	And I saw the holy city – the new Jerusalem – descending out of heaven from God , made ready like a bride adorned for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying : “ Look ! The residence of God is among human beings . He will live among them , and they will be his people , and God himself will be with them .
66021004	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes , and death will not exist any more – or mourning , or crying , or pain , for the former things have ceased to exist . ”
66021005	And the one seated on the throne said : “ Look ! I am making all things new ! ” Then he said to me , “ Write it down , because these words are reliable and true . ”
66021006	He also said to me , “ It is done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end . To the one who is thirsty I will give water free of charge from the spring of the water of life .
66021007	The one who conquers will inherit these things , and I will be his God and he will be my son .
66021008	But to the cowards , unbelievers , detestable persons , murderers , the sexually immoral , and those who practice magic spells , idol worshipers , and all those who lie , their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur . That is the second death . ”
66021009	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues came and spoke to me , saying , “ Come , I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb ! ”
66021010	So he took me away in the Spirit to a huge , majestic mountain and showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God .
66021011	The city possesses the glory of God ; its brilliance is like a precious jewel , like a stone of crystal-clear jasper .
66021012	It has a massive , high wall with twelve gates , with twelve angels at the gates , and the names of the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel are written on the gates .
66021013	There are three gates on the east side , three gates on the north side , three gates on the south side and three gates on the west side .
66021014	The wall of the city has twelve foundations , and on them are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	The angel who spoke to me had a golden measuring rod with which to measure the city and its foundation stones and wall .
66021016	Now the city is laid out as a square , its length and width the same . He measured the city with the measuring rod at fourteen hundred miles ( its length and width and height are equal ) .
66021017	He also measured its wall , one hundred forty-four cubits according to human measurement , which is also the angel’s .
66021018	The city’s wall is made of jasper and the city is pure gold , like transparent glass .
66021019	The foundations of the city’s wall are decorated with every kind of precious stone . The first foundation is jasper , the second sapphire , the third agate , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	the fifth onyx , the sixth carnelian , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , and the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve gates are twelve pearls – each one of the gates is made from just one pearl ! The main street of the city is pure gold , like transparent glass .
66021022	Now I saw no temple in the city , because the Lord God – the All-Powerful – and the Lamb are its temple .
66021023	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it , because the glory of God lights it up , and its lamp is the Lamb .
66021024	The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their grandeur into it .
66021025	Its gates will never be closed during the day ( and there will be no night there ) .
66021026	They will bring the grandeur and the wealth of the nations into it ,
66021027	but nothing ritually unclean will ever enter into it , nor anyone who does what is detestable or practices falsehood , but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life .
66022001	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life – water as clear as crystal – pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb ,
66022002	flowing down the middle of the city’s main street . On each side of the river is the tree of life producing twelve kinds of fruit , yielding its fruit every month of the year . Its leaves are for the healing of the nations .
66022003	And there will no longer be any curse , and the throne of God and the Lamb will be in the city . His servants will worship him ,
66022004	and they will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	Night will be no more , and they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , because the Lord God will shine on them , and they will reign forever and ever .
66022006	Then the angel said to me , “ These words are reliable and true . The Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon . ”
66022007	( Look ! I am coming soon ! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy expressed in this book . )
66022008	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things , and when I heard and saw them , I threw myself down to worship at the feet of the angel who was showing them to me .
66022009	But he said to me , “ Do not do this ! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets , and with those who obey the words of this book . Worship God ! ”
66022010	Then he said to me , “ Do not seal up the words of the prophecy contained in this book , because the time is near .
66022011	The evildoer must continue to do evil , and the one who is morally filthy must continue to be filthy . The one who is righteous must continue to act righteously , and the one who is holy must continue to be holy . ”
66022012	( Look ! I am coming soon , and my reward is with me to pay each one according to what he has done !
