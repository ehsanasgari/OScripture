40001001	THE BOOK of the ancestry ( genealogy ) of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , the son ( descendant ) of David , the son ( descendant ) of Abraham .
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac , Isaac the father of Jacob , Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers ,
40001003	Judah the father of Perez and Zerah , whose mother was Tamar , Perez the father of Hezron , Hezron the father of Aram ,
40001004	Aram the father of Aminadab , Aminadab the father of Nahshon , Nahshon the father of Salmon ,
40001005	Salmon the father of Boaz , whose mother was Rahab , Boaz the father of Obed , whose mother was Ruth , Obed the father of Jesse ,

40001007	Solomon the father of Rehoboam , Rehoboam the father of Abijah , Abijah the father of Asa ,
40001008	Asa the father of Jehoshaphat , Jehoshaphat the father of Joram [ Jehoram ] , Joram the father of Uzziah ,
40001009	Uzziah the father of Jotham , Jotham the father of Ahaz , Ahaz the father of Hezekiah ,
40001010	Hezekiah the father of Manasseh , Manasseh the father of Amon , Amon the father of Josiah ,
40001011	And Josiah became the father of Jeconiah [ also called Coniah and Jehoiachin ] and his brothers about the time of the removal ( deportation ) to Babylon .
40001012	After the exile to Babylon , Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel [ Salathiel ] , Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel ,
40001013	Zerubbabel the father of Abiud , Abiud the father of Eliakim , Eliakim the father of Azor ,
40001014	Azor the father of Sadoc , Sadoc the father of Achim , Achim the father of Eliud ,
40001015	Eliud the father of Eleazar , Eleazar the father of Matthan , Matthan the father of Jacob ,
40001016	Jacob the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , Who is called the Christ . ( the Messiah , the Anointed )
40001017	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen , from David to the Babylonian exile ( deportation ) fourteen generations , from the Babylonian exile to the Christ fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place under these circumstances : When His mother Mary had been promised in marriage to Joseph , before they came together , she was found to be pregnant [ through the power ] of the Holy Spirit .
40001019	And her [ promised ] husband Joseph , being a just and upright man and not willing to expose her publicly and to shame and disgrace her , decided to repudiate and dismiss ( divorce ) her quietly and secretly .
40001020	But as he was thinking this over , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , Joseph , descendant of David , do not be afraid to take Mary [ as ] your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of ( from , out of ) the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will bear a Son , and you shall call His name Jesus [ the Greek form of the Hebrew Joshua , which means Savior ] , for He will save His people from their sins [ that is , prevent them from failing and missing the true end and scope of life , which is God ] .
40001022	All this took place that it might be fulfilled which the Lord had spoken through the prophet ,
40001023	Behold , the virgin shall become pregnant and give birth to a Son , and they shall call His name Emmanuel -- which , when translated , means , God with us .
40001024	Then Joseph , being aroused from his sleep , did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him : he took [ her to his side as ] his wife .
40001025	But he had no union with her as her husband until she had borne her firstborn Son ; and he called His name Jesus .
40002001	NOW WHEN Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king , behold , wise men [ astrologers ] from the east came to Jerusalem , asking ,
40002002	Where is He Who has been born King of the Jews ? For we have seen His star in the east at its rising and have come to worship Him .
40002003	When Herod the king heard this , he was disturbed and troubled , and the whole of Jerusalem with him .
40002004	So he called together all the chief priests and learned men ( scribes ) of the people and anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born .
40002005	They replied to him , In Bethlehem of Judea , for so it is written by the prophet :
40002006	And you Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , you are not in any way least or insignificant among the chief cities of Judah ; for from you shall come a Ruler ( Leader ) Who will govern and shepherd My people Israel .
40002007	Then Herod sent for the wise men [ astrologers ] secretly , and accurately to the last point ascertained from them the time of the appearing of the star [ that is , how long the star had made itself visible since its rising in the east ] .
40002008	Then he sent them to Bethlehem , saying , Go and search for the Child carefully and diligently , and when you have found Him , bring me word , that I too may come and worship Him .
40002009	When they had listened to the king , they went their way , and behold , the star which had been seen in the east in its rising went before them until it came and stood over the place where the young Child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they were thrilled with ecstatic joy .
40002011	And on going into the house , they saw the Child with Mary His mother , and they fell down and worshiped Him . Then opening their treasure bags , they presented to Him gifts -- gold and frankincense and myrrh .
40002012	And receiving an answer to their asking , they were divinely instructed and warned in a dream not to go back to Herod ; so they departed to their own country by a different way .
40002013	Now after they had gone , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , Get up ! [ Tenderly ] take unto you the young Child and His mother and flee to Egypt ; and remain there till I tell you [ otherwise ] , for Herod intends to search for the Child in order to destroy Him .
40002014	And having risen , he took the Child and His mother by night and withdrew to Egypt
40002015	And remained there until Herod’s death . This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet , Out of Egypt have I called My Son .
40002016	Then Herod , when he realized that he had been misled by the wise men , was furiously enraged , and he sent and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that territory who were two years old and under , reckoning according to the date which he had investigated diligently and had learned exactly from the wise men .
40002017	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah :
40002018	A voice was heard in Ramah , wailing and loud lamentation , Rachel weeping for her children ; she refused to be comforted , because they were no more .
40002019	But when Herod died , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40002020	And said , Rise , [ tenderly ] take unto you the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel , for those who sought the Child’s life are dead .
40002021	Then he awoke and arose and [ tenderly ] took the Child and His mother and came into the land of Israel .
40002022	But because he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in the place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . And being divinely warned in a dream , he withdrew to the region of Galilee .
40002023	He went and dwelt in a town called Nazareth , so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled : He shall be called a Nazarene [ Branch , Separated One ] .
40003001	IN THOSE days there appeared John the Baptist , preaching in the Wilderness ( Desert ) of Judea
40003002	And saying , Repent ( think differently ; change your mind , regretting your sins and changing your conduct ) , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
40003003	This is he who was mentioned by the prophet Isaiah when he said , The voice of one crying in the wilderness ( shouting in the desert ) , Prepare the road for the Lord , make His highways straight ( level , direct ) .
40003004	This same John’s garments were made of camel’s hair , and he wore a leather girdle about his waist ; and his food was locusts and wild honey .
40003005	Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country round about the Jordan went out to him ;
40003006	And they were baptized in the Jordan by him , confessing their sins .
40003007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism , he said to them , You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee and escape from the wrath and indignation [ of God against disobedience ] that is coming ?
40003008	Bring forth fruit that is consistent with repentance [ let your lives prove your change of heart ] ;
40003009	And do not presume to say to yourselves , We have Abraham for our forefather ; for I tell you , God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones !
40003010	And already the ax is lying at the root of the trees ; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40003011	I indeed baptize you in ( with ) water because of repentance [ that is , because of your changing your minds for the better , heartily amending your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ] . But He Who is coming after me is mightier than I , Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to take off or carry ; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
40003012	His winnowing fan ( shovel , fork ) is in His hand , and He will thoroughly clear out and clean His threshing floor and gather and store His wheat in His barn , but the chaff He will burn up with fire that cannot be put out .
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him .
40003014	But John protested strenuously , having in mind to prevent Him , saying , It is I who have need to be baptized by You , and do You come to me ?
40003015	But Jesus replied to him , Permit it just now ; for this is the fitting way for [ both of ] us to fulfill all righteousness [ that is , to perform completely whatever is right ] . Then he permitted Him .
40003016	And when Jesus was baptized , He went up at once out of the water ; and behold , the heavens were opened , and he [ John ] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on Him .
40003017	And behold , a voice from heaven said , This is My Son , My Beloved , in Whom I delight !
40004001	THEN JESUS was led ( guided ) by the [ Holy ] Spirit into the wilderness ( desert ) to be tempted ( tested and tried ) by the devil .
40004002	And He went without food for forty days and forty nights , and later He was hungry .
40004003	And the tempter came and said to Him , If You are God’s Son , command these stones to be made [ loaves of ] bread .
40004004	But He replied , It has been written , Man shall not live and be upheld and sustained by bread alone , but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God .
40004005	Then the devil took Him into the holy city and placed Him on a turret ( pinnacle , gable ) of the temple sanctuary .
40004006	And he said to Him , If You are the Son of God , throw Yourself down ; for it is written , He will give His angels charge over you , and they will bear you up on their hands , lest you strike your foot against a stone .
40004007	Jesus said to him , On the other hand , it is written also , You shall not tempt , test thoroughly , or try exceedingly the Lord your God .
40004008	Again , the devil took Him up on a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory ( the splendor , magnificence , preeminence , and excellence ) of them .
40004009	And he said to Him , These things , all taken together , I will give You , if You will prostrate Yourself before me and do homage and worship me .
40004010	Then Jesus said to him , Begone , Satan ! For it has been written , You shall worship the Lord your God , and Him alone shall you serve .
40004011	Then the devil departed from Him , and behold , angels came and ministered to Him .
40004012	Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested and put in prison , He withdrew into Galilee .
40004013	And leaving Nazareth , He went and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea , in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali --
40004014	That what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be brought to pass :
40004015	The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , in the way to the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles [ of the peoples who are not of Israel ] --
40004016	The people who sat ( dwelt enveloped ) in darkness have seen a great Light , and for those who sat in the land and shadow of death Light has dawned .
40004017	From that time Jesus began to preach , crying out , Repent ( change your mind for the better , heartily amend your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ) , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
40004018	As He was walking by the Sea of Galilee , He noticed two brothers , Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother , throwing a dragnet into the sea , for they were fishermen .
40004019	And He said to them , Come after Me [ as disciples -- letting Me be your Guide ] , follow Me , and I will make you fishers of men !
40004020	At once they left their nets and became His disciples [ sided with His party and followed Him ] .
40004021	And going on further from there He noticed two other brothers , James son of Zebedee and his brother John , in the boat with their father Zebedee , mending their nets and putting them right ; and He called them .
40004022	At once they left the boat and their father and joined Jesus as disciples [ sided with His party and followed Him ] .
40004023	And He went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news ( Gospel ) of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every weakness and infirmity among the people .
40004024	So the report of Him spread throughout all Syria , and they brought Him all who were sick , those afflicted with various diseases and torments , those under the power of demons , and epileptics , and paralyzed people , and He healed them .
40004025	And great crowds joined and accompanied Him about , coming from Galilee and Decapolis [ the district of the ten cities east of the Sea of Galilee ] and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other [ the east ] side of the Jordan .
40005001	SEEING THE crowds , He went up on the mountain ; and when He was seated , His disciples came to Him .
40005002	Then He opened His mouth and taught them , saying :
40005003	Blessed ( happy , to be envied , and spiritually prosperous -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the poor in spirit ( the humble , who rate themselves insignificant ) , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven !
40005004	Blessed and enviably happy [ with a happiness produced by the experience of God’s favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His matchless grace ] are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted !
40005005	Blessed ( happy , blithesome , joyous , spiritually prosperous -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the meek ( the mild , patient , long-suffering ) , for they shall inherit the earth !
40005006	Blessed and fortunate and happy and spiritually prosperous ( in that state in which the born-again child of God enjoys His favor and salvation ) are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness ( uprightness and right standing with God ) , for they shall be completely satisfied !
40005007	Blessed ( happy , to be envied , and spiritually prosperous -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy !
40005008	Blessed ( happy , enviably fortunate , and spiritually prosperous -- possessing the happiness produced by the experience of God’s favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His grace , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the pure in heart , for they shall see God !
40005009	Blessed ( enjoying enviable happiness , spiritually prosperous -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the makers and maintainers of peace , for they shall be called the sons of God !
40005010	Blessed and happy and enviably fortunate and spiritually prosperous ( in the state in which the born-again child of God enjoys and finds satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , regardless of his outward conditions ) are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake ( for being and doing right ) , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven !
40005011	Blessed ( happy , to be envied , and spiritually prosperous -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , regardless of your outward conditions ) are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you falsely on My account .
40005012	Be glad and supremely joyful , for your reward in heaven is great ( strong and intense ) , for in this same way people persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	You are the salt of the earth , but if salt has lost its taste ( its strength , its quality ) , how can its saltiness be restored ? It is not good for anything any longer but to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A city set on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a peck measure , but on a lampstand , and it gives light to all in the house .
40005016	Let your light so shine before men that they may see your moral excellence and your praiseworthy , noble , and good deeds and recognize and honor and praise and glorify your Father Who is in heaven .
40005017	Do not think that I have come to do away with or undo the Law or the Prophets ; I have come not to do away with or undo but to complete and fulfill them .
40005018	For truly I tell you , until the sky and earth pass away and perish , not one smallest letter nor one little hook [ identifying certain Hebrew letters ] will pass from the Law until all things [ it foreshadows ] are accomplished .
40005019	Whoever then breaks or does away with or relaxes one of the least [ important ] of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least [ important ] in the kingdom of heaven , but he who practices them and teaches others to do so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I tell you , unless your righteousness ( your uprightness and your right standing with God ) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	You have heard that it was said to the men of old , You shall not kill , and whoever kills shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court .
40005022	But I say to you that everyone who continues to be angry with his brother or harbors malice ( enmity of heart ) against him shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court ; and whoever speaks contemptuously and insultingly to his brother shall be liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the Sanhedrin , and whoever says , You cursed fool ! [ You empty-headed idiot ! ] shall be liable to and unable to escape the hell ( Gehenna ) of fire .
40005023	So if when you are offering your gift at the altar you there remember that your brother has any [ grievance ] against you ,
40005024	Leave your gift at the altar and go . First make peace with your brother , and then come back and present your gift .
40005025	Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way traveling with him , lest your accuser hand you over to the judge , and the judge to the guard , and you be put in prison .
40005026	Truly I say to you , you will not be released until you have paid the last fraction of a penny .
40005027	You have heard that it was said , You shall not commit adultery .
40005028	But I say to you that everyone who so much as looks at a woman with evil desire for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin , pluck it out and throw it away . It is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be cast into hell ( Gehenna ) .
40005030	And if your right hand serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin , cut it off and cast it from you . It is better that you lose one of your members than that your entire body should be cast into hell ( Gehenna ) .
40005031	It has also been said , Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce .
40005032	But I tell you , Whoever dismisses and repudiates and divorces his wife , except on the grounds of unfaithfulness ( sexual immorality ) , causes her to commit adultery , and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery .
40005033	Again , you have heard that it was said to the men of old , You shall not swear falsely , but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord [ as a religious duty ] .
40005034	But I tell you , Do not bind yourselves by an oath at all : either by heaven , for it is the throne of God ;
40005035	Or by the earth , for it is the footstool of His feet ; or by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the Great King .
40005036	And do not swear by your head , for you are not able to make a single hair white or black .
40005037	Let your Yes be simply Yes , and your No be simply No ; anything more than that comes from the evil one .
40005038	You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth .
40005039	But I say to you , Do not resist the evil man [ who injures you ] ; but if anyone strikes you on the right jaw or cheek , turn to him the other one too .
40005040	And if anyone wants to sue you and take your undershirt ( tunic ) , let him have your coat also .
40005041	And if anyone forces you to go one mile , go with him two [ miles ] .
40005042	Give to him who keeps on begging from you , and do not turn away from him who would borrow [ at interest ] from you .
40005043	You have heard that it was said , You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy ;
40005044	But I tell you , Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	To show that you are the children of your Father Who is in heaven ; for He makes His sun rise on the wicked and on the good , and makes the rain fall upon the upright and the wrongdoers [ alike ] .
40005046	For if you love those who love you , what reward can you have ? Do not even the tax collectors do that ?
40005047	And if you greet only your brethren , what more than others are you doing ? Do not even the Gentiles ( the heathen ) do that ?
40005048	You , therefore , must be perfect [ growing into complete maturity of godliness in mind and character , having reached the proper height of virtue and integrity ] , as your heavenly Father is perfect .
40006001	TAKE CARE not to do your good deeds publicly or before men , in order to be seen by them ; otherwise you will have no reward [ reserved for and awaiting you ] with and from your Father Who is in heaven .
40006002	Thus , whenever you give to the poor , do not blow a trumpet before you , as the hypocrites in the synagogues and in the streets like to do , that they may be recognized and honored and praised by men . Truly I tell you , they have their reward in full already .
40006003	But when you give to charity , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	So that your deeds of charity may be in secret ; and your Father Who sees in secret will reward you openly .
40006005	Also when you pray , you must not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets , that they may be seen by people . Truly I tell you , they have their reward in full already .
40006006	But when you pray , go into your [ most ] private room , and , closing the door , pray to your Father , Who is in secret ; and your Father , Who sees in secret , will reward you in the open .
40006007	And when you pray , do not heap up phrases ( multiply words , repeating the same ones over and over ) as the Gentiles do , for they think they will be heard for their much speaking .
40006008	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him .
40006009	Pray , therefore , like this : Our Father Who is in heaven , hallowed ( kept holy ) be Your name .
40006010	Your kingdom come , Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
40006011	Give us this day our daily bread .
40006012	And forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven ( left , remitted , and let go of the debts , and have given up resentment against ) our debtors .
40006013	And lead ( bring ) us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever . Amen .
40006014	For if you forgive people their trespasses [ their reckless and willful sins , leaving them , letting them go , and giving up resentment ] , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive others their trespasses [ their reckless and willful sins , leaving them , letting them go , and giving up resentment ] , neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses .
40006016	And whenever you are fasting , do not look gloomy and sour and dreary like the hypocrites , for they put on a dismal countenance , that their fasting may be apparent to and seen by men . Truly I say to you , they have their reward in full already .
40006017	But when you fast , perfume your head and wash your face ,
40006018	So that your fasting may not be noticed by men but by your Father , Who sees in secret ; and your Father , Who sees in secret , will reward you in the open .
40006019	Do not gather and heap up and store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust and worm consume and destroy , and where thieves break through and steal .
40006020	But gather and heap up and store for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust nor worm consume and destroy , and where thieves do not break through and steal ;
40006021	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
40006022	The eye is the lamp of the body . So if your eye is sound , your entire body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eye is unsound , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the very light in you [ your conscience ] is darkened , how dense is that darkness !
40006024	No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise and be against the other . You cannot serve God and mammon ( deceitful riches , money , possessions , or whatever is trusted in ) .
40006025	Therefore I tell you , stop being perpetually uneasy ( anxious and worried ) about your life , what you shall eat or what you shall drink ; or about your body , what you shall put on . Is not life greater [ in quality ] than food , and the body [ far above and more excellent ] than clothing ?
40006026	Look at the birds of the air ; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns , and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them . Are you not worth much more than they ?
40006027	And who of you by worrying and being anxious can add one unit of measure ( cubit ) to his stature or to the span of his life ?
40006028	And why should you be anxious about clothes ? Consider the lilies of the field and learn thoroughly how they grow ; they neither toil nor spin .
40006029	Yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his magnificence ( excellence , dignity , and grace ) was not arrayed like one of these .
40006030	But if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today is alive and green and tomorrow is tossed into the furnace , will He not much more surely clothe you , O you of little faith ?
40006031	Therefore do not worry and be anxious , saying , What are we going to have to eat ? or , What are we going to have to drink ? or , What are we going to have to wear ?
40006032	For the Gentiles ( heathen ) wish for and crave and diligently seek all these things , and your heavenly Father knows well that you need them all .
40006033	But seek ( aim at and strive after ) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness ( His way of doing and being right ) , and then all these things taken together will be given you besides .
40006034	So do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow , for tomorrow will have worries and anxieties of its own . Sufficient for each day is its own trouble .
40007001	DO NOT judge and criticize and condemn others , so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourselves .
40007002	For just as you judge and criticize and condemn others , you will be judged and criticized and condemned , and in accordance with the measure you [ use to ] deal out to others , it will be dealt out again to you .
40007003	Why do you stare from without at the very small particle that is in your brother’s eye but do not become aware of and consider the beam of timber that is in your own eye ?
40007004	Or how can you say to your brother , Let me get the tiny particle out of your eye , when there is the beam of timber in your own eye ?
40007005	You hypocrite , first get the beam of timber out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take the tiny particle out of your brother’s eye .
40007006	Do not give that which is holy ( the sacred thing ) to the dogs , and do not throw your pearls before hogs , lest they trample upon them with their feet and turn and tear you in pieces .
40007007	Keep on asking and it will be given you ; keep on seeking and you will find ; keep on knocking [ reverently ] and [ the door ] will be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who keeps on asking receives ; and he who keeps on seeking finds ; and to him who keeps on knocking , [ the door ] will be opened .
40007009	Or what man is there of you , if his son asks him for a loaf of bread , will hand him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish , will hand him a serpent ?
40007011	If you then , evil as you are , know how to give good and advantageous gifts to your children , how much more will your Father Who is in heaven [ perfect as He is ] give good and advantageous things to those who keep on asking Him !
40007012	So then , whatever you desire that others would do to and for you , even so do also to and for them , for this is ( sums up ) the Law and the Prophets .
40007013	Enter through the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and spacious and broad is the way that leads away to destruction , and many are those who are entering through it .
40007014	But the gate is narrow ( contracted by pressure ) and the way is straitened and compressed that leads away to life , and few are those who find it .
40007015	Beware of false prophets , who come to you dressed as sheep , but inside they are devouring wolves .
40007016	You will fully recognize them by their fruits . Do people pick grapes from thorns , or figs from thistles ?
40007017	Even so , every healthy ( sound ) tree bears good fruit [ worthy of admiration ] , but the sickly ( decaying , worthless ) tree bears bad ( worthless ) fruit .
40007018	A good ( healthy ) tree cannot bear bad ( worthless ) fruit , nor can a bad ( diseased ) tree bear excellent fruit [ worthy of admiration ] .
40007019	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
40007020	Therefore , you will fully know them by their fruits .
40007021	Not everyone who says to Me , Lord , Lord , will enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of My Father Who is in heaven .
40007022	Many will say to Me on that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in Your name and driven out demons in Your name and done many mighty works in Your name ?
40007023	And then I will say to them openly ( publicly ) , I never knew you ; depart from Me , you who act wickedly [ disregarding My commands ] .
40007024	So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them [ obeying them ] will be like a sensible ( prudent , practical , wise ) man who built his house upon the rock .
40007025	And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house ; yet it did not fall , because it had been founded on the rock .
40007026	And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them will be like a stupid ( foolish ) man who built his house upon the sand .
40007027	And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell -- and great and complete was the fall of it .
40007028	When Jesus had finished these sayings [ the Sermon on the Mount ] , the crowds were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His teaching ,
40007029	For He was teaching as One Who had [ and was ] authority , and not as [ did ] the scribes .
40008001	WHEN JESUS came down from the mountain , great throngs followed Him .
40008002	And behold , a leper came up to Him and , prostrating himself , worshiped Him , saying , Lord , if You are willing , You are able to cleanse me by curing me .
40008003	And He reached out His hand and touched him , saying , I am willing ; be cleansed by being cured . And instantly his leprosy was cured and cleansed .
40008004	And Jesus said to him , See that you tell nothing about this to anyone ; but go , show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded , for a testimony [ to your healing ] and as an evidence to the people .
40008005	As Jesus went into Capernaum , a centurion came up to Him , begging Him ,
40008006	And saying , Lord , my servant boy is lying at the house paralyzed and distressed with intense pains .
40008007	And Jesus said to him , I will come and restore him .
40008008	But the centurion replied to Him , Lord , I am not worthy or fit to have You come under my roof ; but only speak the word , and my servant boy will be cured .
40008009	For I also am a man subject to authority , with soldiers subject to me . And I say to one , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my slave , Do this , and he does it .
40008010	When Jesus heard him , He marveled and said to those who followed Him [ who adhered steadfastly to Him , conforming to His example in living and , if need be , in dying also ] , I tell you truly , I have not found so much faith as this with anyone , even in Israel .
40008011	I tell you , many will come from east and west , and will sit at table with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven ,
40008012	While the sons and heirs of the kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside , where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth .
40008013	Then to the centurion Jesus said , Go ; it shall be done for you as you have believed . And the servant boy was restored to health at that very moment .
40008014	And when Jesus went into Peter’s house , He saw his mother-in-law lying ill with a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand and the fever left her ; and she got up and began waiting on Him .
40008016	When evening came , they brought to Him many who were under the power of demons , and He drove out the spirits with a word and restored to health all who were sick .
40008017	And thus He fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah , He Himself took [ in order to carry away ] our weaknesses and infirmities and bore away our diseases .
40008018	Now Jesus , when He saw the great throngs around Him , gave orders to cross to the other side [ of the lake ] .
40008019	And a scribe came up and said to Him , Master , I will accompany You wherever You go .
40008020	And Jesus replied to him , Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have lodging places , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head .
40008021	Another of the disciples said to Him , Lord , let me first go and bury [ care for till death ] my father .
40008022	But Jesus said to him , Follow Me , and leave the dead [ in sin ] to bury their own dead .
40008023	And after He got into the boat , His disciples followed Him .
40008024	And suddenly , behold , there arose a violent storm on the sea , so that the boat was being covered up by the waves ; but He was sleeping .
40008025	And they went and awakened Him , saying , Lord , rescue and preserve us ! We are perishing !
40008026	And He said to them , Why are you timid and afraid , O you of little faith ? Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great and wonderful calm ( a perfect peaceableness ) .
40008027	And the men were stunned with bewildered wonder and marveled , saying , What kind of Man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey Him !
40008028	And when He arrived at the other side in the country of the Gadarenes , two men under the control of demons went to meet Him , coming out of the tombs , so fierce and savage that no one was able to pass that way .
40008029	And behold , they shrieked and screamed , What have You to do with us , Jesus , Son of God ? Have You come to torment us before the appointed time ?
40008030	Now at some distance from there a drove of many hogs was grazing .
40008031	And the demons begged Him , If You drive us out , send us into the drove of hogs .
40008032	And He said to them , Begone ! So they came out and went into the hogs , and behold , the whole drove rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water .
40008033	The herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything , including what had happened to the men under the power of demons .
40008034	And behold , the whole town went out to meet Jesus ; and as soon as they saw Him , they begged Him to depart from their locality .
40009001	AND JESUS , getting into a boat , crossed to the other side and came to His own town [ Capernaum ] .
40009002	And behold , they brought to Him a man paralyzed and prostrated by illness , lying on a sleeping pad ; and when Jesus saw their faith , He said to the paralyzed man , Take courage , son ; your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted .
40009003	And behold , some of the scribes said to themselves , This man blasphemes [ He claims the rights and prerogatives of God ] !
40009004	But Jesus , knowing ( seeing ) their thoughts , said , Why do you think evil and harbor malice in your hearts ?
40009005	For which is easier : to say , Your sins are forgiven and the penalty remitted , or to say , Get up and walk ?
40009006	But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins and remit the penalty , He then said to the paralyzed man , Get up ! Pick up your sleeping pad and go to your own house .
40009007	And he got up and went away to his own house .
40009008	When the crowds saw it , they were struck with fear and awe ; and they recognized God and praised and thanked Him , Who had given such power and authority to men .
40009009	As Jesus passed on from there , He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s office ; and He said to him , Be My disciple [ side with My party and follow Me ] . And he rose and followed Him .
40009010	And as Jesus reclined at table in the house , behold , many tax collectors and [ especially wicked ] sinners came and sat ( reclined ) with Him and His disciples .
40009011	And when the Pharisees saw this , they said to His disciples , Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and those [ preeminently ] sinful ?
40009012	But when Jesus heard it , He replied , Those who are strong and well ( healthy ) have no need of a physician , but those who are weak and sick .
40009013	Go and learn what this means : I desire mercy [ that is , readiness to help those in trouble ] and not sacrifice and sacrificial victims . For I came not to call and invite [ to repentance ] the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God ) , but sinners ( the erring ones and all those not free from sin ) .
40009014	Then the disciples of John came to Jesus , inquiring , Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast often , [ that is , abstain from food and drink as a religious exercise ] , but Your disciples do not fast ?
40009015	And Jesus replied to them , Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is still with them ? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .
40009016	And no one puts a piece of cloth that has not been shrunk on an old garment , for such a patch tears away from the garment and a worse rent ( tear ) is made .
40009017	Neither is new wine put in old wineskins ; for if it is , the skins burst and are torn in pieces , and the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined . But new wine is put into fresh wineskins , and so both are preserved .
40009018	While He was talking this way to them , behold , a ruler entered and , kneeling down , worshiped Him , saying , My daughter has just now died ; but come and lay Your hand on her , and she will come to life .
40009019	And Jesus got up and accompanied him , with His disciples .
40009020	And behold , a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment ;
40009021	For she kept saying to herself , If I only touch His garment , I shall be restored to health .
40009022	Jesus turned around and , seeing her , He said , Take courage , daughter ! Your faith has made you well . And at once the woman was restored to health .
40009023	And when Jesus came to the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making an uproar and din ,
40009024	He said , Go away ; for the girl is not dead but sleeping . And they laughed and jeered at Him .
40009025	But when the crowd had been ordered to go outside , He went in and took her by the hand , and the girl arose .
40009026	And the news about this spread through all that district .
40009027	As Jesus passed on from there , two blind men followed Him , shouting loudly , Have pity and mercy on us , Son of David !
40009028	When He reached the house and went in , the blind men came to Him , and Jesus said to them , Do you believe that I am able to do this ? They said to Him , Yes , Lord .
40009029	Then He touched their eyes , saying , According to your faith and trust and reliance [ on the power invested in Me ] be it done to you ;
40009030	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus earnestly and sternly charged them , See that you let no one know about this .
40009031	But they went off and blazed and spread His fame abroad throughout that whole district .
40009032	And while they were going away , behold , a dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus .
40009033	And when the demon was driven out , the dumb man spoke ; and the crowds were stunned with bewildered wonder , saying , Never before has anything like this been seen in Israel .
40009034	But the Pharisees said , He drives out demons through and with the help of the prince of demons .
40009035	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and every weakness and infirmity .
40009036	When He saw the throngs , He was moved with pity and sympathy for them , because they were bewildered ( harassed and distressed and dejected and helpless ) , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then He said to His disciples , The harvest is indeed plentiful , but the laborers are few .
40009038	So pray to the Lord of the harvest to force out and thrust laborers into His harvest .
40010001	AND JESUS summoned to Him His twelve disciples and gave them power and authority over unclean spirits , to drive them out , and to cure all kinds of disease and all kinds of weakness and infirmity .
40010002	Now these are the names of the twelve apostles ( special messengers ) : first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew [ Nathaniel ] ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus [ Judas , not Iscariot ] ;
40010004	Simon the Cananaean , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed Him .
40010005	Jesus sent out these twelve , charging them , Go nowhere among the Gentiles and do not go into any town of the Samaritans ;
40010006	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40010007	And as you go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand !
40010008	Cure the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , drive out demons . Freely ( without pay ) you have received , freely ( without charge ) give .
40010009	Take no gold nor silver nor [ even ] copper money in your purses ( belts ) ;
40010010	And do not take a provision bag or a wallet for a collection bag for your journey , nor two undergarments , nor sandals , nor a staff ; for the workman deserves his support ( his living , his food ) .
40010011	And into whatever town or village you go , inquire who in it is deserving , and stay there [ at his house ] until you leave [ that vicinity ] .
40010012	As you go into the house , give your greetings and wish it well .
40010013	Then if indeed that house is deserving , let come upon it your peace [ that is , freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ] . But if it is not deserving , let your peace return to you .
40010014	And whoever will not receive and accept and welcome you nor listen to your message , as you leave that house or town , shake the dust [ of it ] from your feet .
40010015	Truly I tell you , it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town .
40010016	Behold , I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves ; be wary and wise as serpents , and be innocent ( harmless , guileless , and without falsity ) as doves .
40010017	Be on guard against men [ whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God ] ; for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues ,
40010018	And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake , as a witness to bear testimony before them and to the Gentiles ( the nations ) .
40010019	But when they deliver you up , do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak ; for what you are to say will be given you in that very hour and moment ,
40010020	For it is not you who are speaking , but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	Brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child ; and children will take a stand against their parents and will have them put to death .
40010022	And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake , but he who perseveres and endures to the end will be saved [ from spiritual disease and death in the world to come ] .
40010023	When they persecute you in one town [ that is , pursue you in a manner that would injure you and cause you to suffer because of your belief ] , flee to another town ; for truly I tell you , you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	A disciple is not above his teacher , nor is a servant or slave above his master .
40010025	It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his teacher , and the servant or slave like his master . If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub [ master of the dwelling ] , how much more will they speak evil of those of His household .
40010026	So have no fear of them ; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed , or kept secret that will not become known .
40010027	What I say to you in the dark , tell in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim upon the housetops .
40010028	And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul ; but rather be afraid of Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell ( Gehenna ) .
40010029	Are not two little sparrows sold for a penny ? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s leave ( consent ) and notice .
40010030	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	Fear not , then ; you are of more value than many sparrows .
40010032	Therefore , everyone who acknowledges Me before men and confesses Me [ out of a state of oneness with Me ] , I will also acknowledge him before My Father Who is in heaven and confess [ that I am abiding in ] him .
40010033	But whoever denies and disowns Me before men , I also will deny and disown him before My Father Who is in heaven .
40010034	Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth ; I have not come to bring peace , but a sword .
40010035	For I have come to part asunder a man from his father , and a daughter from her mother , and a newly married wife from her mother-in-law --
40010036	And a man’s foes will be they of his own household .
40010037	He who loves [ and takes more pleasure in ] father or mother more than [ in ] Me is not worthy of Me ; and he who loves [ and takes more pleasure in ] son or daughter more than [ in ] Me is not worthy of Me ;
40010038	And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me [ cleave steadfastly to Me , conforming wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying also ] is not worthy of Me .
40010039	Whoever finds his [ lower ] life will lose it [ the higher life ] , and whoever loses his [ lower ] life on My account will find it [ the higher life ] .
40010040	He who receives and welcomes and accepts you receives and welcomes and accepts Me , and he who receives and welcomes and accepts Me receives and welcomes and accepts Him Who sent Me .
40010041	He who receives and welcomes and accepts a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward , and he who receives and welcomes and accepts a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward .
40010042	And whoever gives to one of these little ones [ in rank or influence ] even a cup of cold water because he is My disciple , surely I declare to you , he shall not lose his reward .
40011001	WHEN JESUS had finished His charge to His twelve disciples , He left there to teach and to preach in their [ Galilean ] cities .
40011002	Now when John in prison heard about the activities of Christ , he sent a message by his disciples
40011003	And asked Him , Are You the One Who was to come , or should we keep on expecting a different one ?
40011004	And Jesus replied to them , Go and report to John what you hear and see :
40011005	The blind receive their sight and the lame walk , lepers are cleansed ( by healing ) and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up and the poor have good news ( the Gospel ) preached to them .
40011006	And blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) is he who takes no offense at Me and finds no cause for stumbling in or through Me and is not hindered from seeing the Truth .
40011007	Then as these men went their way , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : What did you go out in the wilderness ( desert ) to see ? A reed swayed by the wind ?
40011008	What did you go out to see then ? A man clothed in soft garments ? Behold , those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings .
40011009	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and one [ out of the common , more eminent , more remarkable , and ] superior to a prophet .
40011010	This is the one of whom it is written , Behold , I send My messenger ahead of You , who shall make ready Your way before You .
40011011	Truly I tell you , among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist ; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	And from the days of John the Baptist until the present time , the kingdom of heaven has endured violent assault , and violent men seize it by force [ as a precious prize -- a share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion ] .
40011013	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied up until John .
40011014	And if you are willing to receive and accept it , John himself is Elijah who was to come [ before the kingdom ] .
40011015	He who has ears to hear , let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing .
40011016	But to what shall I liken this generation ? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their playmates ,
40011017	We piped to you [ playing wedding ] , and you did not dance ; we wailed dirges [ playing funeral ] , and you did not mourn and beat your breasts and weep aloud .
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking [ with others ] , and they say , He has a demon !
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking [ with others ] , and they say , Behold , a glutton and a wine drinker , a friend of tax collectors and [ especially wicked ] sinners ! Yet wisdom is justified and vindicated by what she does ( her deeds ) and by her children .
40011020	Then He began to censure and reproach the cities in which most of His mighty works had been performed , because they did not repent [ and their hearts were not changed ] .
40011021	Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes [ and their hearts would have been changed ] .
40011022	I tell you [ further ] , it shall be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , are you to be lifted up to heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades [ the region of the dead ] ! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have continued until today .
40011024	But I tell you , it shall be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you .
40011025	At that time Jesus began to say , I thank You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth [ and I acknowledge openly and joyfully to Your honor ] , that You have hidden these things from the wise and clever and learned , and revealed them to babies [ to the childish , untaught , and unskilled ] .
40011026	Yes , Father , [ I praise You that ] such was Your gracious will and good pleasure .
40011027	All things have been entrusted and delivered to Me by My Father ; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Son except the Father , and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son deliberately wills to make Him known .
40011028	Come to Me , all you who labor and are heavy-laden and overburdened , and I will cause you to rest . [ I will ease and relieve and refresh your souls . ]
40011029	Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me , for I am gentle ( meek ) and humble ( lowly ) in heart , and you will find rest ( relief and ease and refreshment and recreation and blessed quiet ) for your souls .
40011030	For My yoke is wholesome ( useful , good -- not harsh , hard , sharp , or pressing , but comfortable , gracious , and pleasant ) , and My burden is light and easy to be borne .
40012001	AT THAT particular time Jesus went through the fields of standing grain on the Sabbath ; and His disciples were hungry , and they began to pick off the spikes of grain and to eat .
40012002	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said to Him , See there ! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful and not permitted on the Sabbath .
40012003	He said to them , Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry , and those who accompanied him --
40012004	How he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the showbread -- which was not lawful for him to eat , nor for the men who accompanied him , but for the priests only ?
40012005	Or have you never read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath [ breaking it ] and yet are guiltless ?
40012006	But I tell you , Something greater and more exalted and more majestic than the temple is here !
40012007	And if you had only known what this saying means , I desire mercy [ readiness to help , to spare , to forgive ] rather than sacrifice and sacrificial victims , you would not have condemned the guiltless .
40012008	For the Son of Man is Lord [ even ] of the Sabbath .
40012009	And going on from there , He went into their synagogue .
40012010	And behold , a man was there with one withered hand . And they said to Him , Is it lawful or allowable to cure people on the Sabbath days ? -- that they might accuse Him .
40012011	But He said to them , What man is there among you , if he has only one sheep and it falls into a pit or ditch on the Sabbath , will not take hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	How much better and of more value is a man than a sheep ! So it is lawful and allowable to do good on the Sabbath days .
40012013	Then He said to the man , Reach out your hand . And the man reached it out and it was restored , as sound as the other one .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and held a consultation against Him , how they might do away with Him .
40012015	But being aware of this , Jesus went away from there . And many people joined and accompanied Him , and He cured all of them ,
40012016	And strictly charged them and sharply warned them not to make Him publicly known .
40012017	This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah ,
40012018	Behold , My Servant Whom I have chosen , My Beloved in and with Whom My soul is well pleased and has found its delight . I will put My Spirit upon Him , and He shall proclaim and show forth justice to the nations .
40012019	He will not strive or wrangle or cry out loudly ; nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets ;
40012020	A bruised reed He will not break , and a smoldering ( dimly burning ) wick He will not quench , till He brings justice and a just cause to victory .
40012021	And in and on His name will the Gentiles ( the peoples outside of Israel ) set their hopes .
40012022	Then a blind and dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus , and He cured him , so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw .
40012023	And all the [ crowds of ] people were stunned with bewildered wonder and said , This cannot be the Son of David , can it ?
40012024	But the Pharisees , hearing it , said , This Man drives out demons only by and with the help of Beelzebub , the prince of demons .
40012025	And knowing their thoughts , He said to them , Any kingdom that is divided against itself is being brought to desolation and laid waste , and no city or house divided against itself will last or continue to stand .
40012026	And if Satan drives out Satan , he has become divided against himself and disunified ; how then will his kingdom last or continue to stand ?
40012027	And if I drive out the demons by [ help of ] Beelzebub , by whose [ help ] do your sons drive them out ? For this reason they shall be your judges .
40012028	But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out the demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you [ before you expected it ] .
40012029	Or how can a person go into a strong man’s house and carry off his goods ( the entire equipment of his house ) without first binding the strong man ? Then indeed he may plunder his house .
40012030	He who is not with Me [ definitely on My side ] is against Me , and he who does not [ definitely ] gather with Me and for My side scatters .
40012031	Therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy ( every evil , abusive , injurious speaking , or indignity against sacred things ) can be forgiven men , but blasphemy against the [ Holy ] Spirit shall not and cannot be forgiven .
40012032	And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but whoever speaks against the Spirit , the Holy One , will not be forgiven , either in this world and age or in the world and age to come .
40012033	Either make the tree sound ( healthy and good ) , and its fruit sound ( healthy and good ) , or make the tree rotten ( diseased and bad ) , and its fruit rotten ( diseased and bad ) ; for the tree is known and recognized and judged by its fruit .
40012034	You offspring of vipers ! How can you speak good things when you are evil ( wicked ) ? For out of the fullness ( the overflow , the superabundance ) of the heart the mouth speaks .
40012035	The good man from his inner good treasure flings forth good things , and the evil man out of his inner evil storehouse flings forth evil things .
40012036	But I tell you , on the day of judgment men will have to give account for every idle ( inoperative , nonworking ) word they speak .
40012037	For by your words you will be justified and acquitted , and by your words you will be condemned and sentenced .
40012038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him , Teacher , we desire to see a sign or miracle from You [ proving that You are what You claim to be ] .
40012039	But He replied to them , An evil and adulterous generation ( a generation morally unfaithful to God ) seeks and demands a sign ; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	For even as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , Someone more and greater than Jonah is here !
40012042	The queen of the South will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , Someone more and greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	But when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man , it roams through dry [ arid ] places in search of rest , but it does not find any .
40012044	Then it says , I will go back to my house from which I came out . And when it arrives , it finds the place unoccupied , swept , put in order , and decorated .
40012045	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they go in and make their home there . And the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first . So also shall it be with this wicked generation .
40012046	Jesus was still speaking to the people when behold , His mother and brothers stood outside , seeking to speak to Him .
40012047	Someone said to Him , Listen ! Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , seeking to speak to You .
40012048	But He replied to the man who told Him , Who is My mother , and who are My brothers ?
40012049	And stretching out His hand toward [ not only the twelve disciples but all ] His adherents , He said , Here are My mother and My brothers .
40012050	For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother !
40013001	THAT SAME day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting beside the sea .
40013002	But such great crowds gathered about Him that He got into a boat and remained sitting there , while all the throng stood on the shore .
40013003	And He told them many things in parables ( stories by way of illustration and comparison ) , saying , A sower went out to sow .
40013004	And as he sowed , some seeds fell by the roadside , and the birds came and ate them up .
40013005	Other seeds fell on rocky ground , where they had not much soil ; and at once they sprang up , because they had no depth of soil .
40013006	But when the sun rose , they were scorched , and because they had no root , they dried up and withered away .
40013007	Other seeds fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them out .
40013008	Other seeds fell on good soil , and yielded grain -- some a hundred times as much as was sown , some sixty times as much , and some thirty .
40013009	He who has ears [ to hear ] , let him be listening and let him consider and perceive and comprehend by hearing .
40013010	Then the disciples came to Him and said , Why do You speak to them in parables ?
40013011	And He replied to them , To you it has been given to know the secrets and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been given .
40013012	For whoever has [ spiritual knowledge ] , to him will more be given and he will be furnished richly so that he will have abundance ; but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
40013013	This is the reason that I speak to them in parables : because having the power of seeing , they do not see ; and having the power of hearing , they do not hear , nor do they grasp and understand .
40013014	In them indeed is the process of fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah , which says : You shall indeed hear and hear but never grasp and understand ; and you shall indeed look and look but never see and perceive .
40013015	For this nation’s heart has grown gross ( fat and dull ) , and their ears heavy and difficult of hearing , and their eyes they have tightly closed , lest they see and perceive with their eyes , and hear and comprehend the sense with their ears , and grasp and understand with their heart , and turn and I should heal them .
40013016	But blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) are your eyes because they do see , and your ears because they do hear .
40013017	Truly I tell you , many prophets and righteous men [ men who were upright and in right standing with God ] yearned to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it .
40013018	Listen then to the [ meaning of the ] parable of the sower :
40013019	While anyone is hearing the Word of the kingdom and does not grasp and comprehend it , the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is what was sown along the roadside .
40013020	As for what was sown on thin ( rocky ) soil , this is he who hears the Word and at once welcomes and accepts it with joy ;
40013021	Yet it has no real root in him , but is temporary ( inconstant , lasts but a little while ) ; and when affliction or trouble or persecution comes on account of the Word , at once he is caused to stumble [ he is repelled and begins to distrust and desert Him Whom he ought to trust and obey ] and he falls away .
40013022	As for what was sown among thorns , this is he who hears the Word , but the cares of the world and the pleasure and delight and glamour and deceitfulness of riches choke and suffocate the Word , and it yields no fruit .
40013023	As for what was sown on good soil , this is he who hears the Word and grasps and comprehends it ; he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundred times as much as was sown , in another sixty times as much , and in another thirty .
40013024	Another parable He set forth before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	But while he was sleeping , his enemy came and sowed also darnel ( weeds resembling wheat ) among the wheat , and went on his way .
40013026	So when the plants sprouted and formed grain , the darnel ( weeds ) appeared also .
40013027	And the servants of the owner came to him and said , Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? Then how does it have darnel shoots in it ?
40013028	He replied to them , An enemy has done this . The servants said to him , Then do you want us to go and weed them out ?
40013029	But he said , No , lest in gathering the wild wheat ( weeds resembling wheat ) , you root up the [ true ] wheat along with it .
40013030	Let them grow together until the harvest ; and at harvest time I will say to the reapers , Gather the darnel first and bind it in bundles to be burned , but gather the wheat into my granary .
40013031	Another story by way of comparison He set forth before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field .
40013032	Of all the seeds it is the smallest , but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and find shelter in its branches .
40013033	He told them another parable : The kingdom of heaven is like leaven ( sour dough ) which a woman took and covered over in three measures of meal or flour till all of it was leavened .
40013034	These things all taken together Jesus said to the crowds in parables ; indeed , without a parable He said nothing to them .
40013035	This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet : I will open My mouth in parables ; I will utter things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world .
40013036	Then He left the throngs and went into the house . And His disciples came to Him saying , Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field .
40013037	He answered , He Who sows the good seed is the Son of Man .
40013038	The field is the world , and the good seed means the children of the kingdom ; the darnel is the children of the evil one ,
40013039	And the enemy who sowed it is the devil . The harvest is the close and consummation of the age , and the reapers are angels .
40013040	Just as the darnel ( weeds resembling wheat ) is gathered and burned with fire , so it will be at the close of the age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send forth His angels , and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of offense [ persons by whom others are drawn into error or sin ] and all who do iniquity and act wickedly ,
40013042	And will cast them into the furnace of fire ; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth .
40013043	Then will the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God ) shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Let him who has ears [ to hear ] be listening , and let him consider and perceive and understand by hearing .
40013044	The kingdom of heaven is like something precious buried in a field , which a man found and hid again ; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field .
40013045	Again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a dealer in search of fine and precious pearls ,
40013046	Who , on finding a single pearl of great price , went and sold all he had and bought it .
40013047	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet which was cast into the sea and gathered in fish of every sort .
40013048	When it was full , men dragged it up on the beach , and sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets , but the worthless ones they threw away .
40013049	So it will be at the close and consummation of the age . The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God )
40013050	And cast them [ the wicked ] into the furnace of fire ; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth .
40013051	Have you understood all these things [ parables ] taken together ? They said to Him , Yes , Lord .
40013052	He said to them , Therefore every teacher and interpreter of the Sacred Writings who has been instructed about and trained for the kingdom of heaven and has become a disciple is like a householder who brings forth out of his storehouse treasure that is new and [ treasure that is ] old [ the fresh as well as the familiar ] .
40013053	When Jesus had finished these parables ( these comparisons ) , He left there .
40013054	And coming to His own country [ Nazareth ] , He taught in their synagogue so that they were amazed with bewildered wonder , and said , Where did this Man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers ?
40013055	Is not this the carpenter’s Son ? Is not His mother called Mary ? And are not His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
40013056	And do not all His sisters live here among us ? Where then did this Man get all this ?
40013057	And they took offense at Him [ they were repelled and hindered from acknowledging His authority , and caused to stumble ] . But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house .
40013058	And He did not do many works of power there , because of their unbelief ( their lack of faith in the divine mission of Jesus ) .
40014001	AT THAT time Herod the governor heard the reports about Jesus ,
40014002	And he said to his attendants , This is John the Baptist ; He has been raised from the dead , and that is why the powers of performing miracles are at work in Him .
40014003	For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison [ to stow him out of the way ] on account and for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife ,
40014004	For John had said to him , It is not lawful or right for you to have her .
40014005	Although he wished to have him put to death , he was afraid of the people , for they regarded John as a prophet .
40014006	But when Herod’s birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst [ before the company ] and pleased and fascinated Herod ,
40014007	And so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask .
40014008	And she , being put forward and prompted by her mother , said , Give me the head of John the Baptist right here on a platter .
40014009	And the king was distressed and sorry , but because of his oaths and his guests , he ordered it to be given her ;
40014010	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison .
40014011	And his head was brought in on a platter and given to the little maid , and she brought it to her mother .
40014012	And John’s disciples came and took up the body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus .
40014013	When Jesus heard it , He withdrew from there privately in a boat to a solitary place . But when the crowds heard of it , they followed Him [ by land ] on foot from the towns .
40014014	When He went ashore and saw a great throng of people , He had compassion ( pity and deep sympathy ) for them and cured their sick .
40014015	When evening came , the disciples came to Him and said , This is a remote and barren place , and the day is now over ; send the throngs away into the villages to buy food for themselves .
40014016	Jesus said , They do not need to go away ; you give them something to eat .
40014017	They said to Him , We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish .
40014018	He said , Bring them here to Me .
40014019	Then He ordered the crowds to recline on the grass ; and He took the five loaves and the two fish , and , looking up to heaven , He gave thanks and blessed and broke the loaves and handed the pieces to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
40014020	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they picked up twelve [ small hand ] baskets full of the broken pieces left over .
40014021	And those who ate were about 5,000 men , not including women and children .
40014022	Then He directed the disciples to get into the boat and go before Him to the other side , while He sent away the crowds .
40014023	And after He had dismissed the multitudes , He went up into the hills by Himself to pray . When it was evening , He was still there alone .
40014024	But the boat was by this time out on the sea , many furlongs [ a furlong is one-eighth of a mile ] distant from the land , beaten and tossed by the waves , for the wind was against them .
40014025	And in the fourth watch [ between 3:00 -- 6:00 a.m. ] of the night , Jesus came to them , walking on the sea .
40014026	And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea , they were terrified and said , It is a ghost ! And they screamed out with fright .
40014027	But instantly He spoke to them , saying , Take courage ! I AM ! Stop being afraid !
40014028	And Peter answered Him , Lord , if it is You , command me to come to You on the water .
40014029	He said , Come ! So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water , and he came toward Jesus .
40014030	But when he perceived and felt the strong wind , he was frightened , and as he began to sink , he cried out , Lord , save me [ from death ] !
40014031	Instantly Jesus reached out His hand and caught and held him , saying to him , O you of little faith , why did you doubt ?
40014032	And when they got into the boat , the wind ceased .
40014033	And those in the boat knelt and worshiped Him , saying , Truly You are the Son of God !
40014034	And when they had crossed over to the other side , they went ashore at Gennesaret .
40014035	And when the men of that place recognized Him , they sent around into all the surrounding country and brought to Him all who were sick
40014036	And begged Him to let them merely touch the fringe of His garment ; and as many as touched it were perfectly restored .
40015001	THEN FROM Jerusalem came scribes and Pharisees and said ,
40015002	Why do Your disciples transgress and violate the rules handed down by the elders of the past ? For they do not practice [ ceremonially ] washing their hands before they eat .
40015003	He replied to them , And why also do you transgress and violate the commandment of God for the sake of the rules handed down to you by your forefathers ( the elders ) ?
40015004	For God commanded , Honor your father and your mother , and , He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother , let him surely come to his end by death .
40015005	But you say , If anyone tells his father or mother , What you would have gained from me [ that is , the money and whatever I have that might be used for helping you ] is already dedicated as a gift to God , then he is exempt and no longer under obligation to honor and help his father or his mother .
40015006	So for the sake of your tradition ( the rules handed down by your forefathers ) , you have set aside the Word of God [ depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect ] .
40015007	You pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! Admirably and truly did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said :
40015008	These people draw near Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips , but their hearts hold off and are far away from Me .
40015009	Uselessly do they worship Me , for they teach as doctrines the commands of men .
40015010	And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them , Listen and grasp and comprehend this :
40015011	It is not what goes into the mouth of a man that makes him unclean and defiled , but what comes out of the mouth ; this makes a man unclean and defiles [ him ] .
40015012	Then the disciples came and said to Him , Do You know that the Pharisees were displeased and offended and indignant when they heard this saying ?
40015013	He answered , Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be torn up by the roots .
40015014	Let them alone and disregard them ; they are blind guides and teachers . And if a blind man leads a blind man , both will fall into a ditch .
40015015	But Peter said to Him , Explain this proverb ( this maxim ) to us .
40015016	And He said , Are you also even yet dull and ignorant [ without understanding and unable to put things together ] ?
40015017	Do you not see and understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the abdomen and so passes on into the place where discharges are deposited ?
40015018	But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart , and this is what makes a man unclean and defiles [ him ] .
40015019	For out of the heart come evil thoughts ( reasonings and disputings and designs ) such as murder , adultery , sexual vice , theft , false witnessing , slander , and irreverent speech .
40015020	These are what make a man unclean and defile [ him ] ; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean or defile [ him ] .
40015021	And going away from there , Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	And behold , a woman who was a Canaanite from that district came out and , with a [ loud , troublesomely urgent ] cry , begged , Have mercy on me , O Lord , Son of David ! My daughter is miserably and distressingly and cruelly possessed by a demon !
40015023	But He did not answer her a word . And His disciples came and implored Him , saying , Send her away , for she is crying out after us .
40015024	He answered , I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
40015025	But she came and , kneeling , worshiped Him and kept praying , Lord , help me !
40015026	And He answered , It is not right ( proper , becoming , or fair ) to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs .
40015027	She said , Yes , Lord , yet even the little pups ( little whelps ) eat the crumbs that fall from their [ young ] masters’ table .
40015028	Then Jesus answered her , O woman , great is your faith ! Be it done for you as you wish . And her daughter was cured from that moment .
40015029	And Jesus went on from there and passed along the shore of the Sea of Galilee . Then He went up into the hills and kept sitting there .
40015030	And a great multitude came to Him , bringing with them the lame , the maimed , the blind , the dumb , and many others , and they put them down at His feet ; and He cured them ,
40015031	So that the crowd was amazed when they saw the dumb speaking , the maimed made whole , the lame walking , and the blind seeing ; and they recognized and praised and thanked and glorified the God of Israel .
40015032	Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said , I have pity and sympathy and am deeply moved for the crowd , because they have been with Me now three days and they have nothing [ at all left ] to eat ; and I am not willing to send them away hungry , lest they faint or become exhausted on the way .
40015033	And the disciples said to Him , Where are we to get bread sufficient to feed so great a crowd in this isolated and desert place ?
40015034	And Jesus asked them , How many loaves of bread do you have ? They replied , Seven , and a few small fish .
40015035	And ordering the crowd to recline on the ground ,
40015036	He took the seven loaves and the fish , and when He had given thanks , He broke them and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
40015037	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they gathered up seven [ large provision ] baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
40015038	Those who ate were 4,000 men , not including the women and the children .
40015039	Then He dismissed the crowds , got into the boat , and went to the district of Magadan .
40016001	NOW THE Pharisees and Sadducees came up to Jesus , and they asked Him to show them a sign ( spectacular miracle ) from heaven [ attesting His divine authority ] .
40016002	He replied to them , When it is evening you say , It will be fair weather , for the sky is red ,
40016003	And in the morning , It will be stormy today , for the sky is red and has a gloomy and threatening look . You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky , but you cannot interpret the signs of the times .
40016004	A wicked and morally unfaithful generation craves a sign , but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah . Then He left them and went away .
40016005	When the disciples reached the other side of the sea , they found that they had forgotten to bring any bread .
40016006	Jesus said to them , Be careful and on your guard against the leaven ( ferment ) of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016007	And they reasoned among themselves about it , saying , It is because we did not bring any bread .
40016008	But Jesus , aware of this , asked , Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread ? O you [ men , how little trust you have in Me , how ] little faith !
40016009	Do you not yet discern ( perceive and understand ) ? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many [ small hand ] baskets you gathered ?
40016010	Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many [ large provision ] baskets you took up ?
40016011	How is it that you fail to understand that I was not talking to you about bread ? But beware of the leaven ( ferment ) of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016012	Then they discerned that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	Now when Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi , He asked His disciples , Who do people say that the Son of Man is ?
40016014	And they answered , Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets .
40016015	He said to them , But who do you [ yourselves ] say that I am ?
40016016	Simon Peter replied , You are the Christ , the Son of the living God .
40016017	Then Jesus answered him , Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) are you , Simon Bar-Jonah . For flesh and blood [ men ] have not revealed this to you , but My Father Who is in heaven .
40016018	And I tell you , you are Peter [ Greek , Petros -- a large piece of rock ] , and on this rock [ Greek , petra -- a huge rock like Gibraltar ] I will build My church , and the gates of Hades ( the powers of the infernal region ) shall not overpower it [ or be strong to its detriment or hold out against it ] .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; and whatever you bind ( declare to be improper and unlawful ) on earth must be what is already bound in heaven ; and whatever you loose ( declare lawful ) on earth must be what is already loosed in heaven .
40016020	Then He sternly and strictly charged and warned the disciples to tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ .
40016021	From that time forth Jesus began [ clearly ] to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and the high priests and scribes , and be killed , and on the third day be raised from death .
40016022	Then Peter took Him aside to speak to Him privately and began to reprove and charge Him sharply , saying , God forbid , Lord ! This must never happen to You !
40016023	But Jesus turned away from Peter and said to him , Get behind Me , Satan ! You are in My way [ an offense and a hindrance and a snare to Me ] ; for you are minding what partakes not of the nature and quality of God , but of men .
40016024	Then Jesus said to His disciples , If anyone desires to be My disciple , let him deny himself [ disregard , lose sight of , and forget himself and his own interests ] and take up his cross and follow Me [ cleave steadfastly to Me , conform wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying , also ] .
40016025	For whoever is bent on saving his [ temporal ] life [ his comfort and security here ] shall lose it [ eternal life ] ; and whoever loses his life [ his comfort and security here ] for My sake shall find it [ life everlasting ] .
40016026	For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life [ his blessed life in the kingdom of God ] ? Or what would a man give as an exchange for his [ blessed ] life [ in the kingdom of God ] ?
40016027	For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory ( majesty , splendor ) of His Father with His angels , and then He will render account and reward every man in accordance with what he has done .
40016028	Truly I tell you , there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in ( into ) His kingdom .
40017001	AND SIX days after this , Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother , and led them up on a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	And His appearance underwent a change in their presence ; and His face shone clear and bright like the sun , and His clothing became as white as light .
40017003	And behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , who kept talking with Him .
40017004	Then Peter began to speak and said to Jesus , Lord , it is good and delightful that we are here ; if You approve , I will put up three booths here -- one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah .
40017005	While he was still speaking , behold , a shining cloud [ composed of light ] overshadowed them , and a voice from the cloud said , This is My Son , My Beloved , with Whom I am [ and have always been ] delighted . Listen to Him !
40017006	When the disciples heard it , they fell on their faces and were seized with alarm and struck with fear .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them and said , Get up , and do not be afraid .
40017008	And when they raised their eyes , they saw no one but Jesus only .
40017009	And as they were going down the mountain , Jesus cautioned and commanded them , Do not mention to anyone what you have seen , until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead .
40017010	The disciples asked Him , Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ?
40017011	He replied , Elijah does come and will get everything restored and ready .
40017012	But I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they did not know or recognize him , but did to him as they liked . So also the Son of Man is going to be treated and suffer at their hands .
40017013	Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist .
40017014	And when they approached the multitude , a man came up to Him , kneeling before Him and saying ,
40017015	Lord , do pity and have mercy on my son , for he has epilepsy ( is moonstruck ) and he suffers terribly ; for frequently he falls into the fire and many times into the water .
40017016	And I brought him to Your disciples , and they were not able to cure him .
40017017	And Jesus answered , O you unbelieving ( warped , wayward , rebellious ) and thoroughly perverse generation ! How long am I to remain with you ? How long am I to bear with you ? Bring him here to Me .
40017018	And Jesus rebuked the demon , and it came out of him , and the boy was cured instantly .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked privately , Why could we not drive it out ?
40017020	He said to them , Because of the littleness of your faith [ that is , your lack of firmly relying trust ] . For truly I say to you , if you have faith [ that is living ] like a grain of mustard seed , you can say to this mountain , Move from here to yonder place , and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
40017021	But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting .
40017022	When they were going about here and there in Galilee , Jesus said to them , The Son of Man is going to be turned over into the hands of men .
40017023	And they will kill Him , and He will be raised [ to life ] again on the third day . And they were deeply and exceedingly grieved and distressed .
40017024	When they arrived in Capernaum , the collectors of the half shekel [ the temple tax ] went up to Peter and said , Does not your Teacher pay the half shekel ?
40017025	He answered , Yes . And when he came home , Jesus spoke to him [ about it ] first , saying , What do you think , Simon ? From whom do earthly rulers collect duties or tribute -- from their own sons or from others not of their own family ?
40017026	And when Peter said , From other people not of their own family , Jesus said to him , Then the sons are exempt .
40017027	However , in order not to give offense and cause them to stumble [ that is , to cause them to judge unfavorably and unjustly ] go down to the sea and throw in a hook . Take the first fish that comes up , and when you open its mouth you will find there a shekel . Take it and give it to them to pay the temple tax for Me and for yourself .
40018001	AT THAT time the disciples came up and asked Jesus , Who then is [ really ] the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
40018002	And He called a little child to Himself and put him in the midst of them ,
40018003	And said , Truly I say to you , unless you repent ( change , turn about ) and become like little children [ trusting , lowly , loving , forgiving ] , you can never enter the kingdom of heaven [ at all ] .
40018004	Whoever will humble himself therefore and become like this little child [ trusting , lowly , loving , forgiving ] is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	And whoever receives and accepts and welcomes one little child like this for My sake and in My name receives and accepts and welcomes Me .
40018006	But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin [ that is , who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought ] , it would be better ( more expedient and profitable or advantageous ) for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea .
40018007	Woe to the world for such temptations to sin and influences to do wrong ! It is necessary that temptations come , but woe to the person on whose account or by whom the temptation comes !
40018008	And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble and sin , cut it off and throw it away from you ; it is better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire .
40018009	And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin , pluck it out and throw it away from you ; it is better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for you to enter life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell ( Gehenna ) of fire .
40018010	Beware that you do not despise or feel scornful toward or think little of one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always are in the presence of and look upon the face of My Father Who is in heaven .
40018011	For the Son of man came to save [ from the penalty of eternal death ] that which was lost .
40018012	What do you think ? If a man has a hundred sheep , and one of them has gone astray and gets lost , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost ?
40018013	And if it should be that he finds it , truly I say to you , he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost .
40018014	Just so it is not the will of My Father Who is in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost and perish .
40018015	If your brother wrongs you , go and show him his fault , between you and him privately . If he listens to you , you have won back your brother .
40018016	But if he does not listen , take along with you one or two others , so that every word may be confirmed and upheld by the testimony of two or three witnesses .
40018017	If he pays no attention to them [ refusing to listen and obey ] , tell it to the church ; and if he refuses to listen even to the church , let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector .
40018018	Truly I tell you , whatever you forbid and declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be what is already forbidden in heaven , and whatever you permit and declare proper and lawful on earth must be what is already permitted in heaven .
40018019	Again I tell you , if two of you on earth agree ( harmonize together , make a symphony together ) about whatever [ anything and everything ] they may ask , it will come to pass and be done for them by My Father in heaven .
40018020	For wherever two or three are gathered ( drawn together as My followers ) in ( into ) My name , there I AM in the midst of them .
40018021	Then Peter came up to Him and said , Lord , how many times may my brother sin against me and I forgive him and let it go ? [ As many as ] up to seven times ?
40018022	Jesus answered him , I tell you , not up to seven times , but seventy times seven !
40018023	Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a human king who wished to settle accounts with his attendants .
40018024	When he began the accounting , one was brought to him who owed him 10,000 talents [ probably about $ 10,000,000 ] ,
40018025	And because he could not pay , his master ordered him to be sold , with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed , and payment to be made .
40018026	So the attendant fell on his knees , begging him , Have patience with me and I will pay you everything .
40018027	And his master’s heart was moved with compassion , and he released him and forgave him [ cancelling ] the debt .
40018028	But that same attendant , as he went out , found one of his fellow attendants who owed him a hundred denarii [ about twenty dollars ] ; and he caught him by the throat and said , Pay what you owe !
40018029	So his fellow attendant fell down and begged him earnestly , Give me time , and I will pay you all !
40018030	But he was unwilling , and he went out and had him put in prison till he should pay the debt .
40018031	When his fellow attendants saw what had happened , they were greatly distressed , and they went and told everything that had taken place to their master .
40018032	Then his master called him and said to him , You contemptible and wicked attendant ! I forgave and cancelled all that [ great ] debt of yours because you begged me to .
40018033	And should you not have had pity and mercy on your fellow attendant , as I had pity and mercy on you ?
40018034	And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers ( the jailers ) , till he should pay all that he owed .
40018035	So also My heavenly Father will deal with every one of you if you do not freely forgive your brother from your heart his offenses .
40019001	NOW WHEN Jesus had finished saying these things , He left Galilee and went into the part of Judea that is beyond the Jordan ;
40019002	And great throngs accompanied Him , and He cured them there .
40019003	And Pharisees came to Him and put Him to the test by asking , Is it lawful and right to dismiss and repudiate and divorce one’s wife for any and every cause ?
40019004	He replied , Have you never read that He Who made them from the beginning made them male and female ,
40019005	And said , For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united firmly ( joined inseparably ) to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh ?
40019006	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , let not man put asunder ( separate ) .
40019007	They said to Him , Why then did Moses command [ us ] to give a certificate of divorce and thus to dismiss and repudiate a wife ?
40019008	He said to them , Because of the hardness ( stubbornness and perversity ) of your hearts Moses permitted you to dismiss and repudiate and divorce your wives ; but from the beginning it has not been so [ ordained ] .
40019009	I say to you : whoever dismisses ( repudiates , divorces ) his wife , except for unchastity , and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40019010	The disciples said to Him , If the case of a man with his wife is like this , it is neither profitable nor advisable to marry .
40019011	But He said to them , Not all men can accept this saying , but it is for those to whom [ the capacity to receive ] it has been given .
40019012	For there are eunuchs who have been born incapable of marriage ; and there are eunuchs who have been made so by men ; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves incapable of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . Let him who is able to accept this accept it .
40019013	Then little children were brought to Jesus , that He might put His hands on them and pray ; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them .
40019014	But He said , Leave the children alone ! Allow the little ones to come to Me , and do not forbid or restrain or hinder them , for of such [ as these ] is the kingdom of heaven composed .
40019015	And He put His hands upon them , and then went on His way .
40019016	And behold , there came a man up to Him , saying , Teacher , what excellent and perfectly and essentially good deed must I do to possess eternal life ?
40019017	And He said to him , Why do you ask Me about the perfectly and essentially good ? There is only One Who is good [ perfectly and essentially ] -- God . If you would enter into the Life , you must continually keep the commandments .
40019018	He said to Him , What sort of commandments ? [ Or , which ones ? ] And Jesus answered , You shall not kill , You shall not commit adultery , You shall not steal , You shall not bear false witness ,
40019019	Honor your father and your mother , and , You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself .
40019020	The young man said , I have observed all these from my youth ; what still do I lack ?
40019021	Jesus answered him , If you would be perfect [ that is , have that spiritual maturity which accompanies self-sacrificing character ] , go and sell what you have and give to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven ; and come , be My disciple [ side with My party and follow Me ] .
40019022	But when the young man heard this , he went away sad ( grieved and in much distress ) , for he had great possessions .
40019023	And Jesus said to His disciples , Truly I say to you , it will be difficult for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven .
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were utterly puzzled ( astonished , bewildered ) , saying , Who then can be saved [ from eternal death ] ?
40019026	But Jesus looked at them and said , With men this is impossible , but all things are possible with God .
40019027	Then Peter answered Him , saying , Behold , we have left [ our ] all and have become Your disciples [ sided with Your party and followed You ] . What then shall we receive ?
40019028	Jesus said to them , Truly I say to you , in the new age [ the Messianic rebirth of the world ] , when the Son of Man shall sit down on the throne of His glory , you who have [ become My disciples , sided with My party and ] followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And anyone and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name’s sake will receive many [ even a hundred ] times more and will inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many who [ now ] are first will be last [ then ] , and many who [ now ] are last will be first [ then ] .
40020001	FOR THE kingdom of heaven is like the owner of an estate who went out in the morning along with the dawn to hire workmen for his vineyard .
40020002	After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	And going out about the third hour ( nine o’clock ) , he saw others standing idle in the marketplace ;
40020004	And he said to them , You go also into the vineyard , and whatever is right I will pay you . And they went .
40020005	He went out again about the sixth hour ( noon ) , and the ninth hour ( three o’clock ) he did the same .
40020006	And about the eleventh hour ( five o’clock ) he went out and found still others standing around , and said to them , Why do you stand here idle all day ?
40020007	They answered him , Because nobody has hired us . He told them , You go out into the vineyard also and you will get whatever is just and fair .
40020008	When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his manager , Call the workmen and pay them their wages , beginning with the last and ending with the first .
40020009	And those who had been hired at the eleventh hour ( five o’clock ) came and received a denarius each .
40020010	Now when the first came , they supposed they would get more , but each of them also received a denarius .
40020011	And when they received it , they grumbled at the owner of the estate ,
40020012	Saying , These [ men ] who came last worked no more than an hour , and yet you have made them rank with us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day .
40020013	But he answered one of them , Friend , I am doing you no injustice . Did you not agree with me for a denarius ?
40020014	Take what belongs to you and go . I choose to give to this man hired last the same as I give to you .
40020015	Am I not permitted to do what I choose with what is mine ? [ Or do you begrudge my being generous ? ] Is your eye evil because I am good ?
40020016	So those who [ now ] are last will be first [ then ] , and those who [ now ] are first will be last [ then ] . For many are called , but few chosen .
40020017	And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , He took the twelve disciples aside along the way and said to them ,
40020018	Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes ; and they will sentence Him to death
40020019	And deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and whipped and crucified , and He will be raised [ to life ] on the third day .
40020020	Then the mother of Zebedee’s children came up to Him with her sons and , kneeling , worshiped Him and asked a favor of Him .
40020021	And He asked her , What do you wish ? She answered Him , Give orders that these two sons of mine may sit , one at Your right hand and one at Your left in Your kingdom .
40020022	But Jesus replied , You do not realize what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? They answered , We are able .
40020023	He said to them , You will drink My cup , but seats at My right hand and at My left are not Mine to give , but they are for those for whom they have been ordained and prepared by My Father .
40020024	But when the ten [ other disciples ] heard this , they were indignant at the two brothers .
40020025	And Jesus called them to Him and said , You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great men hold them in subjection [ tyrannizing over them ] .
40020026	Not so shall it be among you ; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant ,
40020027	And whoever desires to be first among you must be your slave --
40020028	Just as the Son of Man came not to be waited on but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for many [ the price paid to set them free ] .
40020029	And as they were going out of Jericho , a great throng accompanied Him .
40020030	And behold , two blind men were sitting by the roadside , and when they heard that Jesus was passing by , they cried out , Lord , have pity and mercy on us , [ You ] Son of David !
40020031	The crowds reproved them and told them to keep still ; but they cried out all the more , Lord , have pity and mercy on us , [ You ] Son of David !
40020032	And Jesus stopped and called them , and asked , What do you want Me to do for you ?
40020033	They answered Him , Lord , we want our eyes to be opened !
40020034	And Jesus , in pity , touched their eyes ; and instantly they received their sight and followed Him .
40021001	AND WHEN they came near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage at the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two disciples on ahead ,
40021002	Saying to them , Go into the village that is opposite you , and at once you will find a donkey tied , and a colt with her ; untie [ them ] and bring [ them ] to Me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , you shall reply , The Lord needs them , and he will let them go without delay .
40021004	This happened that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled , saying ,
40021005	Say to the Daughter of Zion [ inhabitants of Jerusalem ] , Behold , your King is coming to you , lowly and riding on a donkey , and on a colt , the foal of a donkey [ a beast of burden ] .
40021006	Then the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their coats upon them , and He seated Himself on them [ the clothing ] .
40021008	And most of the crowd kept spreading their garments on the road , and others kept cutting branches from the trees and scattering them on the road .
40021009	And the crowds that went ahead of Him and those that followed Him kept shouting , Hosanna ( O be propitious , graciously inclined ) to the Son of David , [ the Messiah ] ! Blessed ( praised , glorified ) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna ( O be favorably disposed ) in the highest [ heaven ] !
40021010	And when He entered Jerusalem , all the city became agitated and [ trembling with excitement ] said , Who is This ?
40021011	And the crowds replied , This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee .
40021012	And Jesus went into the temple ( whole temple enclosure ) and drove out all who bought and sold in the sacred place , and He turned over the four-footed tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who sold doves .
40021013	He said to them , The Scripture says , My house shall be called a house of prayer ; but you have made it a den of robbers .
40021014	And the blind and the lame came to Him in the porches and courts of the temple , and He cured them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He did and the boys and the girls and the youths and the maidens crying out in the porches and courts of the temple , Hosanna ( O be propitious , graciously inclined ) to the Son of David ! they were indignant .
40021016	And they said to Him , Do You hear what these are saying ? And Jesus replied to them , Yes ; have you never read , Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have made ( provided ) perfect praise ?
40021017	And leaving them , He departed from the city and went out to Bethany and lodged there .
40021018	In the early dawn the next morning , as He was coming back to the city , He was hungry .
40021019	And as He saw one single leafy fig tree above the roadside , He went to it but He found nothing but leaves on it [ seeing that in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves ] . And He said to it , Never again shall fruit grow on you ! And the fig tree withered up at once .
40021020	When the disciples saw it , they marveled greatly and asked , How is it that the fig tree has withered away all at once ?
40021021	And Jesus answered them , Truly I say to you , if you have faith ( a firm relying trust ) and do not doubt , you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , Be taken up and cast into the sea , it will be done .
40021022	And whatever you ask for in prayer , having faith and [ really ] believing , you will receive .
40021023	And when He entered the sacred enclosure of the temple , the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him as He was teaching and said , By what power of authority are You doing these things , and who gave You this power of authority ?
40021024	Jesus answered them , I also will ask you a question , and if you give Me the answer , then I also will tell you by what power of authority I do these things .
40021025	The baptism of John -- from where was it ? From heaven or from men ? And they reasoned and argued with one another , If we say , From heaven , He will ask us , Why then did you not believe him ?
40021026	But if we say , From men -- we are afraid of and must reckon with the multitude , for they all regard John as a prophet .
40021027	So they answered Jesus , We do not know . And He said to them , Neither will I tell you by what power of authority I do these things .
40021028	What do you think ? There was a man who had two sons . He came to the first and said , Son , go and work today in the vineyard .
40021029	And he answered , I will not ; but afterward he changed his mind and went .
40021030	Then the man came to the second and said the same [ thing ] . And he replied , I will [ go ] , sir ; but he did not go .
40021031	Which of the two did the will of the father ? They replied , The first one . Jesus said to them , Truly I tell you , the tax collectors and the harlots will get into the kingdom of heaven before you .
40021032	For John came to you walking in the way of an upright man in right standing with God , and you did not believe him , but the tax collectors and the harlots did believe him ; and you , even when you saw that , did not afterward change your minds and believe him [ adhere to , trust in , and rely on what he told you ] .
40021033	Listen to another parable : There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a wine vat in it and built a watchtower . Then he let it out [ for rent ] to tenants and went into another country .
40021034	When the fruit season drew near , he sent his servants to the tenants to get his [ share of the ] fruit .
40021035	But the tenants took his servants and beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
40021036	Again he sent other servants , more than the first time , and they treated them the same way .
40021037	Finally he sent his own son to them , saying , They will respect and give heed to my son .
40021038	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , This is the heir ; come on , let us kill him and have his inheritance .
40021039	And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
40021040	Now when the owner of the vineyard comes back , what will he do to those tenants ?
40021041	They said to Him , He will put those wretches to a miserable death and rent the vineyard to other tenants of such a character that they will give him the fruits promptly in their season .
40021042	Jesus asked them , Have you never read in the Scriptures : The very Stone which the builders rejected and threw away has become the Cornerstone ; this is the Lord’s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ?
40021043	I tell you , for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce the fruits of it .
40021044	And whoever falls on this Stone will be broken to pieces , but he on whom It falls will be crushed to powder [ and It will winnow him , scattering him like dust ] .
40021045	And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables ( comparisons , stories used to illustrate and explain ) , they perceived that He was talking about them .
40021046	And although they were trying to arrest Him , they feared the throngs because they regarded Him as a prophet .
40022001	AND AGAIN Jesus spoke to them in parables ( comparisons , stories used to illustrate and explain ) , saying ,
40022002	The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son
40022003	And sent his servants to summon those who had been invited to the wedding banquet , but they refused to come .
40022004	Again he sent other servants , saying , Tell those who are invited , Behold , I have prepared my banquet ; my bullocks and my fat calves are killed , and everything is prepared ; come to the wedding feast .
40022005	But they were not concerned and paid no attention [ they ignored and made light of the summons , treating it with contempt ] and they went away -- one to his farm , another to his business ,
40022006	While the others seized his servants , treated them shamefully , and put them to death .
40022007	[ Hearing this ] the king was infuriated ; and he sent his soldiers and put those murderers to death and burned their city .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , The wedding [ feast ] is prepared , but those invited were not worthy .
40022009	So go to the thoroughfares where they leave the city [ where the main roads and those from the country end ] and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find .
40022010	And those servants went out on the crossroads and got together as many as they found , both bad and good , so [ the room in which ] the wedding feast [ was held ] was filled with guests .
40022011	But when the king came in to view the guests , he looked intently at a man there who had on no wedding garment .
40022012	And he said , Friend , how did you come in here without putting on the [ appropriate ] wedding garment ? And he was speechless ( muzzled , gagged ) .
40022013	Then the king said to the attendants , Tie him hand and foot , and throw him into the darkness outside ; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth .
40022014	For many are called ( invited and summoned ) , but few are chosen .
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and consulted and plotted together how they might entangle Jesus in His talk .
40022016	And they sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians , saying , Teacher , we know that You are sincere and what You profess to be and that You teach the way of God truthfully , regardless of consequences and being afraid of no man ; for You are impartial and do not regard either the person or the position of anyone .
40022017	Tell us then what You think about this : Is it lawful to pay tribute [ levied on individuals and to be paid yearly ] to Caesar or not ?
40022018	But Jesus , aware of their malicious plot , asked , Why do you put Me to the test and try to entrap Me , you pretenders ( hypocrites ) ?
40022019	Show me the money used for the tribute . And they brought Him a denarius .
40022020	And Jesus said to them , Whose likeness and title are these ?
40022021	They said , Caesar’s . Then He said to them , Pay therefore to Caesar the things that are due to Caesar , and pay to God the things that are due to God .
40022022	When they heard it they were amazed and marveled ; and they left Him and departed .
40022023	The same day some Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection [ of the dead ] , came to Him and they asked Him a question ,
40022024	Saying , Teacher , Moses said , If a man dies , leaving no children , his brother shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother .
40022025	Now there were seven brothers among us ; the first married and died , and , having no children , left his wife to his brother .
40022026	The second also died childless , and the third , down to the seventh .
40022027	Last of all , the woman died also .
40022028	Now , in the resurrection , to which of the seven will she be wife ? For they all had her .
40022029	But Jesus replied to them , You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor God’s power .
40022030	For in the resurrected state neither do [ men ] marry nor are [ women ] given in marriage , but they are like the angels in heaven .
40022031	But as to the resurrection of the dead -- have you never read what was said to you by God ,
40022032	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living !
40022033	And when the throng heard it , they were astonished and filled with [ glad ] amazement at His teaching .
40022034	Now when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced ( muzzled ) the Sadducees , they gathered together .
40022035	And one of their number , a lawyer , asked Him a question to test Him .
40022036	Teacher , which kind of commandment is great and important ( the principal kind ) in the Law ? [ Some commandments are light -- which are heavy ? ]
40022037	And He replied to him , You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind ( intellect ) .
40022038	This is the great ( most important , principal ) and first commandment .
40022039	And a second is like it : You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself .
40022040	These two commandments sum up and upon them depend all the Law and the Prophets .
40022041	Now while the Pharisees were still assembled there , Jesus asked them a question ,
40022042	Saying , What do you think of the Christ ? Whose Son is He ? They said to Him , The Son of David .
40022043	He said to them , How is it then that David , under the influence of the [ Holy ] Spirit , calls Him Lord , saying ,
40022044	The Lord said to My Lord , Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet ?
40022045	If then David thus calls Him Lord , how is He his Son ?
40022046	And no one was able to answer Him a word , nor from that day did anyone venture or dare to question Him .
40023001	THEN JESUS said to the multitudes and to His disciples ,
40023002	The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat [ of authority ] .
40023003	So observe and practice all they tell you ; but do not do what they do , for they preach , but do not practice .
40023004	They tie up heavy loads , hard to bear , and place them on men’s shoulders , but they themselves will not lift a finger to help bear them .
40023005	They do all their works to be seen of men ; for they make wide their phylacteries ( small cases enclosing certain Scripture passages , worn during prayer on the left arm and forehead ) and make long their fringes [ worn by all male Israelites , according to the command ] .
40023006	And they take pleasure in and [ thus ] love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues ,
40023007	And to be greeted with honor in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi .
40023008	But you are not to be called rabbi ( teacher ) , for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers .
40023009	And do not call anyone [ in the church ] on earth father , for you have one Father , Who is in heaven .
40023010	And you must not be called masters ( leaders ) , for you have one Master ( Leader ) , the Christ .
40023011	He who is greatest among you shall be your servant .
40023012	Whoever exalts himself [ with haughtiness and empty pride ] shall be humbled ( brought low ) , and whoever humbles himself [ whoever has a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly ] shall be raised to honor .
40023013	But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces ; for you neither enter yourselves , nor do you allow those who are about to go in to do so .
40023014	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you swallow up widows’ houses and for a pretense to cover it up make long prayers ; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation and the heavier sentence .
40023015	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you travel over sea and land to make a single proselyte , and when he becomes one [ a proselyte ] , you make him doubly as much a child of hell ( Gehenna ) as you are .
40023016	Woe to you , blind guides , who say , If anyone swears by the sanctuary of the temple , it is nothing ; but if anyone swears by the gold of the sanctuary , he is a debtor [ bound by his oath ] .
40023017	You blind fools ! For which is greater : the gold , or the sanctuary of the temple that has made the gold sacred ?
40023018	You say too , Whoever swears by the altar is not duty bound ; but whoever swears by the offering on the altar , his oath is binding .
40023019	You blind men ! Which is greater : the gift , or the altar which makes the gift sacred ?
40023020	So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it .
40023021	And he who swears by the sanctuary of the temple swears by it and by Him Who dwells in it .
40023022	And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him Who sits upon it .
40023023	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you give a tenth of your mint and dill and cummin , and have neglected and omitted the weightier ( more important ) matters of the Law -- right and justice and mercy and fidelity . These you ought [ particularly ] to have done , without neglecting the others .
40023024	You blind guides , filtering out a gnat and gulping down a camel !
40023025	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate , but within they are full of extortion ( prey , spoil , plunder ) and grasping self-indulgence .
40023026	You blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and of the plate , so that the outside may be clean also .
40023027	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you are like tombs that have been whitewashed , which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead men’s bones and everything impure .
40023028	Just so , you also outwardly seem to people to be just and upright but inside you are full of pretense and lawlessness and iniquity .
40023029	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous ,
40023030	Saying , If we had lived in the days of our forefathers , we would not have aided them in shedding the blood of the prophets .
40023031	Thus you are testifying against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers’ sins to the brim [ so that nothing may be wanting to a full measure ] .
40023033	You serpents ! You spawn of vipers ! How can you escape the penalty to be suffered in hell ( Gehenna ) ?
40023034	Because of this , take notice : I am sending you prophets and wise men ( interpreters and teachers ) and scribes ( men learned in the Mosaic Law and the Prophets ) ; some of them you will kill , even crucify , and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue and persecute from town to town ,
40023035	So that upon your heads may come all the blood of the righteous ( those who correspond to the divine standard of right ) shed on earth , from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah , whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar [ of burnt offering ] .
40023036	Truly I declare to you , all these [ evil , calamitous times ] will come upon this generation .
40023037	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , murdering the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you ! How often would I have gathered your children together as a mother fowl gathers her brood under her wings , and you refused !
40023038	Behold , your house is forsaken and desolate ( abandoned and left destitute of God’s help ) .
40023039	For I declare to you , you will not see Me again until you say , Blessed ( magnified in worship , adored , and exalted ) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord !
40024001	JESUS DEPARTED from the temple area and was going on His way when His disciples came up to Him to call His attention to the buildings of the temple and point them out to Him .
40024002	But He answered them , Do you see all these ? Truly I tell you , there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down .
40024003	While He was seated on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to Him privately and said , Tell us , when will this take place , and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end ( the completion , the consummation ) of the age ?
40024004	Jesus answered them , Be careful that no one misleads you [ deceiving you and leading you into error ] .
40024005	For many will come in ( on the strength of ) My name [ appropriating the name which belongs to Me ] , saying , I am the Christ ( the Messiah ) , and they will lead many astray .
40024006	And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars ; see that you are not frightened or troubled , for this must take place , but the end is not yet .
40024007	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be famines and earthquakes in place after place ;
40024008	All this is but the beginning [ the early pains ] of the birth pangs [ of the intolerable anguish ] .
40024009	Then they will hand you over to suffer affliction and tribulation and put you to death , and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake .
40024010	And then many will be offended and repelled and will begin to distrust and desert [ Him Whom they ought to trust and obey ] and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred .
40024011	And many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error .
40024012	And the love of the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity ,
40024013	But he who endures to the end will be saved .
40024014	And this good news of the kingdom ( the Gospel ) will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations , and then will come the end .
40024015	So when you see the appalling sacrilege [ the abomination that astonishes and makes desolate ] , spoken of by the prophet Daniel , standing in the Holy Place -- let the reader take notice and ponder and consider and heed [ this ] --
40024016	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ;
40024017	Let him who is on the housetop not come down and go into the house to take anything ;
40024018	And let him who is in the field not turn back to get his overcoat .
40024019	And alas for the women who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days !
40024020	Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath .
40024021	For then there will be great tribulation ( affliction , distress , and oppression ) such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now -- no , and never will be [ again ] .
40024022	And if those days had not been shortened , no human being would endure and survive , but for the sake of the elect ( God’s chosen ones ) those days will be shortened .
40024023	If anyone says to you then , Behold , here is the Christ ( the Messiah ) ! or , There He is ! -- do not believe it .
40024024	For false Christs and false prophets will arise , and they will show great signs and wonders so as to deceive and lead astray , if possible , even the elect ( God’s chosen ones ) .
40024025	See , I have warned you beforehand .
40024026	So if they say to you , Behold , He is in the wilderness ( desert ) -- do not go out there ; if they tell you , Behold , He is in the secret places or inner rooms -- do not believe it .
40024027	For just as the lightning flashes from the east and shines and is seen as far as the west , so will the coming of the Son of Man be .
40024028	Wherever there is a fallen body ( a corpse ) , there the vultures ( or eagles ) will flock together .
40024029	Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not shed its light , and the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken .
40024030	Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky , and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and beat their breasts and lament in anguish , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory [ in brilliancy and splendor ] .
40024031	And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call , and they will gather His elect ( His chosen ones ) from the four winds , [ even ] from one end of the universe to the other .
40024032	From the fig tree learn this lesson : as soon as its young shoots become soft and tender and it puts out its leaves , you know of a surety that summer is near .
40024033	So also when you see these signs , all taken together , coming to pass , you may know of a surety that He is near , at the very doors .
40024034	Truly I tell you , this generation ( the whole multitude of people living at the same time , in a definite , given period ) will not pass away till all these things taken together take place .
40024035	Sky and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
40024036	But of that [ exact ] day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
40024037	As were the days of Noah , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024038	For just as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , [ men ] marrying and [ women ] being given in marriage , until the [ very ] day when Noah went into the ark ,
40024039	And they did not know or understand until the flood came and swept them all away -- so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024040	At that time two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and one will be left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding at the hand mill ; one will be taken and one will be left .
40024042	Watch therefore [ give strict attention , be cautious and active ] , for you do not know in what kind of a day [ whether a near or remote one ] your Lord is coming .
40024043	But understand this : had the householder known in what [ part of the night , whether in a night or a morning ] watch the thief was coming , he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be undermined and broken into .
40024044	You also must be ready therefore , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him .
40024045	Who then is the faithful , thoughtful , and wise servant , whom his master has put in charge of his household to give to the others the food and supplies at the proper time ?
40024046	Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) is that servant whom , when his master comes , he will find so doing .
40024047	I solemnly declare to you , he will set him over all his possessions .
40024048	But if that servant is wicked and says to himself , My master is delayed and is going to be gone a long time ,
40024049	And begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken ,
40024050	The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he is not aware ,
40024051	And will punish him [ cut him up by scourging ] and put him with the pretenders ( hypocrites ) ; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth .
40025001	THEN THE kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish ( thoughtless , without forethought ) and five were wise ( sensible , intelligent , and prudent ) .
40025003	For when the foolish took their lamps , they did not take any [ extra ] oil with them ;
40025004	But the wise took flasks of oil along with them [ also ] with their lamps .
40025005	While the bridegroom lingered and was slow in coming , they all began nodding their heads , and they fell asleep .
40025006	But at midnight there was a shout , Behold , the bridegroom ! Go out to meet him !
40025007	Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order .
40025008	And the foolish said to the wise , Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out .
40025009	But the wise replied , There will not be enough for us and for you ; go instead to the dealers and buy for yourselves .
40025010	But while they were going away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were prepared went in with him to the marriage feast ; and the door was shut .
40025011	Later the other virgins also came and said , Lord , Lord , open [ the door ] to us !
40025012	But He replied , I solemnly declare to you , I do not know you [ I am not acquainted with you ] .
40025013	Watch therefore [ give strict attention and be cautious and active ] , for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come .
40025014	For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey , and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property .
40025015	To one he gave five talents [ probably about $ 5,000 ] , to another two , to another one -- to each in proportion to his own personal ability . Then he departed and left the country .
40025016	He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them , and he gained five talents more .
40025017	And likewise he who had received the two talents -- he also gained two talents more .
40025018	But he who had received the one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money .
40025019	Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them .
40025020	And he who had received the five talents came and brought him five more , saying , Master , you entrusted to me five talents ; see , here I have gained five talents more .
40025021	His master said to him , Well done , you upright ( honorable , admirable ) and faithful servant ! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little ; I will put you in charge of much . Enter into and share the joy ( the delight , the blessedness ) which your master enjoys .
40025022	And he also who had the two talents came forward , saying , Master , you entrusted two talents to me ; here I have gained two talents more .
40025023	His master said to him , Well done , you upright ( honorable , admirable ) and faithful servant ! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little ; I will put you in charge of much . Enter into and share the joy ( the delight , the blessedness ) which your master enjoys .
40025024	He who had received one talent also came forward , saying , Master , I knew you to be a harsh and hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you had not winnowed [ the grain ] .
40025025	So I was afraid , and I went and hid your talent in the ground . Here you have what is your own .
40025026	But his master answered him , You wicked and lazy and idle servant ! Did you indeed know that I reap where I have not sowed and gather [ grain ] where I have not winnowed ?
40025027	Then you should have invested my money with the bankers , and at my coming I would have received what was my own with interest .
40025028	So take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents .
40025029	For to everyone who has will more be given , and he will be furnished richly so that he will have an abundance ; but from the one who does not have , even what he does have will be taken away .
40025030	And throw the good-for-nothing servant into the outer darkness ; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth .
40025031	When the Son of Man comes in His glory ( His majesty and splendor ) , and all the holy angels with Him , then He will sit on the throne of His glory .
40025032	All nations will be gathered before Him , and He will separate them [ the people ] from one another as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats ;
40025033	And He will cause the sheep to stand at His right hand , but the goats at His left .
40025034	Then the King will say to those at His right hand , Come , you blessed of My Father [ you favored of God and appointed to eternal salvation ] , inherit ( receive as your own ) the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
40025035	For I was hungry and you gave Me food , I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink , I was a stranger and you brought Me together with yourselves and welcomed and entertained and lodged Me ,
40025036	I was naked and you clothed Me , I was sick and you visited Me with help and ministering care , I was in prison and you came to see Me .
40025037	Then the just and upright will answer Him , Lord , when did we see You hungry and gave You food , or thirsty and gave You something to drink ?
40025038	And when did we see You a stranger and welcomed and entertained You , or naked and clothed You ?
40025039	And when did we see You sick or in prison and came to visit You ?
40025040	And the King will reply to them , Truly I tell you , in so far as you did it for one of the least [ in the estimation of men ] of these My brethren , you did it for Me .
40025041	Then He will say to those at His left hand , Begone from Me , you cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels !
40025042	For I was hungry and you gave Me no food , I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink ,
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not welcome Me and entertain Me , I was naked and you did not clothe Me , I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me with help and ministering care .
40025044	Then they also [ in their turn ] will answer , Lord , when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not minister to You ?
40025045	And He will reply to them , Solemnly I declare to you , in so far as you failed to do it for the least [ in the estimation of men ] of these , you failed to do it for Me .
40025046	Then they will go away into eternal punishment , but those who are just and upright and in right standing with God into eternal life .
40026001	WHEN JESUS had ended this discourse , He said to His disciples ,
40026002	You know that the Passover is in two days -- and the Son of Man will be delivered up treacherously to be crucified .
40026003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the [ open ] court of the palace of the high priest , whose name was Caiaphas ,
40026004	And consulted together in order to arrest Jesus by stratagem secretly and put Him to death .
40026005	But they said , It must not be during the Feast , for fear that there will be a riot among the people .
40026006	Now when Jesus came back to Bethany and was in the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	A woman came up to Him with an alabaster flask of very precious perfume , and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table .
40026008	And when the disciples saw it , they were indignant , saying , For what purpose is all this waste ?
40026009	For this perfume might have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor .
40026010	But Jesus , fully aware of this , said to them , Why do you bother the woman ? She has done a noble ( praiseworthy and beautiful ) thing to Me .
40026011	For you always have the poor among you , but you will not always have Me .
40026012	In pouring this perfume on My body she has done something to prepare Me for My burial .
40026013	Truly I tell you , wherever this good news ( the Gospel ) is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will be told also , in memory of her .
40026014	Then one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
40026015	And said , What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you ? And they weighed out for and paid to him thirty pieces of silver [ about twenty-one dollars and sixty cents ] .
40026016	And from that moment he sought a fitting opportunity to betray Him .
40026017	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread [ Passover week ] , the disciples came to Jesus and said to Him , Where do You wish us to prepare for You to eat the Passover supper ?
40026018	He said , Go into the city to a certain man and say to him , The Master says : My time is near ; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples .
40026019	And accordingly the disciples did as Jesus had directed them , and they made ready the Passover supper .
40026020	When it was evening , He was reclining at table with the twelve disciples .
40026021	And as they were eating , He said , Solemnly I say to you , one of you will betray Me !
40026022	They were exceedingly pained and distressed and deeply hurt and sorrowful and began to say to Him one after another , Surely it cannot be I , Lord , can it ?
40026023	He replied , He who has [ just ] dipped his hand in the same dish with Me will betray Me !
40026024	The Son of Man is going just as it is written of Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for that man if he had never been born !
40026025	Judas , the betrayer , said , Surely it is not I , is it , Master ? He said to him , You have stated [ the fact ] .
40026026	Now as they were eating , Jesus took bread and , praising God , gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use , and when He had broken it , He gave it to the disciples and said , Take , eat ; this is My body .
40026027	And He took a cup , and when He had given thanks , He gave it to them , saying , Drink of it , all of you ;
40026028	For this is My blood of the new covenant , which [ ratifies the agreement and ] is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	I say to you , I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you new and of superior quality in My Father’s kingdom .
40026030	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus said to them , You will all be offended and stumble and fall away because of Me this night [ distrusting and deserting Me ] , for it is written , I will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered .
40026032	But after I am raised up [ to life again ] , I will go ahead of you to Galilee .
40026033	Peter declared to Him , Though they all are offended and stumble and fall away because of You [ and distrust and desert You ] , I will never do so .
40026034	Jesus said to him , Solemnly I declare to you , this very night , before a single rooster crows , you will deny and disown Me three times .
40026035	Peter said to Him , Even if I must die with You , I will not deny or disown You ! And all the disciples said the same thing .
40026036	Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane , and He told His disciples , Sit down here while I go over yonder and pray .
40026037	And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , He began to show grief and distress of mind and was deeply depressed .
40026038	Then He said to them , My soul is very sad and deeply grieved , so that I am almost dying of sorrow . Stay here and keep awake and keep watch with Me .
40026039	And going a little farther , He threw Himself upon the ground on His face and prayed saying , My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from Me ; nevertheless , not what I will [ not what I desire ] , but as You will and desire .
40026040	And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping , and He said to Peter , What ! Are you so utterly unable to stay awake and keep watch with Me for one hour ?
40026041	All of you must keep awake ( give strict attention , be cautious and active ) and watch and pray , that you may not come into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
40026042	Again a second time He went away and prayed , My Father , if this cannot pass by unless I drink it , Your will be done .
40026043	And again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were weighed down with sleep .
40026044	So , leaving them again , He went away and prayed for the third time , using the same words .
40026045	Then He returned to the disciples and said to them , Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? Behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of especially wicked sinners [ whose way or nature it is to act in opposition to God ] .
40026046	Get up , let us be going ! See , My betrayer is at hand !
40026047	As He was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , came up , and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
40026048	Now the betrayer had given them a sign , saying , The One I shall kiss is the Man ; seize Him .
40026049	And he came up to Jesus at once and said , Hail ( greetings , good health to You , long life to You ) , Master ! And he embraced Him and kissed Him with [ pretended ] warmth and devotion .
40026050	Jesus said to him , Friend , for what are you here ? Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him .
40026051	And behold , one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and , striking the body servant of the high priest , cut off his ear .
40026052	Then Jesus said to him , Put your sword back into its place , for all who draw the sword will die by the sword .
40026053	Do you suppose that I cannot appeal to My Father , and He will immediately provide Me with more than twelve legions [ more than 80,000 ] of angels ?
40026054	But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must come about this way ?
40026055	At that moment Jesus said to the crowds , Have you come out with swords and clubs as [ you would ] against a robber to capture Me ? Day after day I was accustomed to sit in the porches and courts of the temple teaching , and you did not arrest Me .
40026056	But all this has taken place in order that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples deserted Him and , fleeing , escaped .
40026057	But those who had seized Jesus took Him away to Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had assembled .
40026058	But Peter followed Him at a distance , as far as the courtyard of the high priest’s home ; he even went inside and sat with the guards to see the end .
40026059	Now the chief priests and the whole council ( the Sanhedrin ) sought to get false witnesses to testify against Jesus , so that they might put Him to death ;
40026060	But they found none , though many witnesses came forward [ to testify ] . At last two men came forward
40026061	And testified , This Fellow said , I am able to tear down the sanctuary of the temple of God and to build it up again in three days .
40026062	And the high priest stood up and said , Have You no answer to make ? What about this that these men testify against You ?
40026063	But Jesus kept silent . And the high priest said to Him , I call upon you to swear by the living God , and tell us whether you are the Christ , the Son of God .
40026064	Jesus said to him , You have stated [ the fact ] . More than that , I tell you : You will in the future see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of the sky .
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothes and exclaimed , He has uttered blasphemy ! What need have we of further evidence ? You have now heard His blasphemy .
40026066	What do you think now ? They answered , He deserves to be put to death .
40026067	Then they spat in His face and struck Him with their fists ; and some slapped Him in the face ,
40026068	Saying , Prophesy to us , You Christ ( the Messiah ) ! Who was it that struck You ?
40026069	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard , and one maid came up to him and said , You were also with Jesus the Galilean !
40026070	But he denied it falsely before them all , saying , I do not know what you mean .
40026071	And when he had gone out to the porch , another maid saw him , and she said to the bystanders , This fellow was with Jesus the Nazarene !
40026072	And again he denied it and disowned Him with an oath , saying , I do not know the Man !
40026073	After a little while , the bystanders came up and said to Peter , You certainly are one of them too , for even your accent betrays you .
40026074	Then Peter began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear , I do not even know the Man ! And at that moment a rooster crowed .
40026075	And Peter remembered Jesus’ words , when He had said , Before a single rooster crows , you will deny and disown Me three times . And he went outside and wept bitterly .
40027001	WHEN IT was morning , all the chief priests and the elders of the people held a consultation against Jesus to put Him to death ;
40027002	And they bound Him and led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the governor .
40027003	When Judas , His betrayer , saw that [ Jesus ] was condemned , [ Judas was afflicted in mind and troubled for his former folly ; and ] with remorse [ with little more than a selfish dread of the consequences ] he brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders ,
40027004	Saying , I have sinned in betraying innocent blood . They replied , What is that to us ? See to that yourself .
40027005	And casting the pieces of silver [ forward ] into the [ Holy Place of the sanctuary of the ] temple , he departed ; and he went off and hanged himself .
40027006	But the chief priests , picking up the pieces of silver , said , It is not legal to put these in the [ consecrated ] treasury , for it is the price of blood .
40027007	So after consultation they bought with them [ the pieces of silver ] the potter’s field [ as a place ] in which to bury strangers .
40027008	Therefore that piece of ground has been called the Field of Blood to the present day .
40027009	Then were fulfilled the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet when he said , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of Him on Whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel ,
40027010	And they gave them for the potter’s field , as the Lord directed me .
40027011	Now Jesus stood before the governor [ Pilate ] , and the governor asked Him , Are you the King of the Jews ? Jesus said to him , You have stated [ the fact ] .
40027012	But when the charges were made against Him by the chief priests and elders , He made no answer .
40027013	Then Pilate said to Him , Do You not hear how many and how serious are the things they are testifying against You ?
40027014	But He made no reply to him , not even to a single accusation , so that the governor marveled greatly .
40027015	Now at the Feast [ of the Passover ] the governor was in the habit of setting free for the people any one prisoner whom they chose .
40027016	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner whose name was Barabbas .
40027017	So when they had assembled for this purpose , Pilate said to them , Whom do you want me to set free for you , Barabbas , or Jesus Who is called Christ ?
40027018	For he knew that it was because of envy that they had handed Him over to him .
40027019	Also , while he was seated on the judgment bench , his wife sent him a message , saying , Have nothing to do with that just and upright Man , for I have had a painful experience today in a dream because of Him .
40027020	But the chief priests and the elders prevailed on the people to ask for Barabbas , and put Jesus to death .
40027021	Again the governor said to them , Which of the two do you wish me to release for you ? And they said , Barabbas !
40027022	Pilate said to them , Then what shall I do with Jesus Who is called Christ ?
40027023	They all replied , Let Him be crucified ! And he said , Why ? What has He done that is evil ? But they shouted all the louder , Let Him be crucified !
40027024	So when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere , but rather that a riot was about to break out , he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd , saying , I am not guilty of nor responsible for this righteous Man’s blood ; see to it yourselves .
40027025	And all the people answered , Let His blood be on us and on our children !
40027026	So he set free for them Barabbas ; and he [ had ] Jesus whipped , and delivered Him up to be crucified .
40027027	Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the palace , and they gathered the whole battalion about Him .
40027028	And they stripped off His clothes and put a scarlet robe ( garment of dignity and office worn by Roman officers of rank ) upon Him ,
40027029	And , weaving a crown of thorns , they put it on His head and put a reed ( staff ) in His right hand . And kneeling before Him , they made sport of Him , saying , Hail ( greetings , good health to You , long life to You ) , King of the Jews !
40027030	And they spat on Him , and took the reed ( staff ) and struck Him on the head .
40027031	And when they finished making sport of Him , they stripped Him of the robe and put His own garments on Him and led Him away to be crucified .
40027032	As they were marching forth , they came upon a man of Cyrene named Simon ; this man they forced to carry the cross of Jesus .
40027033	And when they came to a place called Golgotha [ Latin : Calvary ] , which means The Place of a Skull ,
40027034	They offered Him wine mingled with gall to drink ; but when He tasted it , He refused to drink it .
40027035	And when they had crucified Him , they divided and distributed His garments [ among them ] by casting lots so that the prophet’s saying was fulfilled , They parted My garments among them and over My apparel they cast lots .
40027036	Then they sat down there and kept watch over Him .
40027037	And over His head they put the accusation against Him ( the cause of His death ) , which read , This is Jesus , the King of the Jews .
40027038	At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him , one on the right hand and one on the left .
40027039	And those who passed by spoke reproachfully and abusively and jeered at Him , wagging their heads ,
40027040	And they said , You Who would tear down the sanctuary of the temple and rebuild it in three days , rescue Yourself from death . If You are the Son of God , come down from the cross .
40027041	In the same way the chief priests , with the scribes and elders , made sport of Him , saying ,
40027042	He rescued others from death ; Himself He cannot rescue from death . He is the King of Israel ? Let Him come down from the cross now , and we will believe in and acknowledge and cleave to Him .
40027043	He trusts in God ; let God deliver Him now if He cares for Him and will have Him , for He said , I am the Son of God .
40027044	And the robbers who were crucified with Him also abused and reproached and made sport of Him in the same way .
40027045	Now from the sixth hour ( noon ) there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour ( three o’clock ) .
40027046	And about the ninth hour ( three o’clock ) Jesus cried with a loud voice , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? -- that is , My God , My God , why have You abandoned Me [ leaving Me helpless , forsaking and failing Me in My need ] ?
40027047	And some of the bystanders , when they heard it , said , This Man is calling for Elijah !
40027048	And one of them immediately ran and took a sponge , soaked it with vinegar ( a sour wine ) , and put it on a reed ( staff ) , and was about to give it to Him to drink .
40027049	But the others said , Wait ! Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him from death .
40027050	And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit .
40027051	And at once the curtain of the sanctuary of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom ; the earth shook and the rocks were split .
40027052	The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep in death were raised [ to life ] ;
40027053	And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection , they went into the holy city and appeared to many people .
40027054	When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus observed the earthquake and all that was happening , they were terribly frightened and filled with awe , and said , Truly this was God’s Son !
40027055	There were also numerous women there , looking on from a distance , who were of those who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee , ministering to Him .
40027056	Among them were Mary of Magdala , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedee’s sons .
40027057	When it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who also was a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus , and Pilate ordered that it be given to him .
40027059	And Joseph took the body and rolled it up in a clean linen cloth used for swathing dead bodies
40027060	And laid it in his own fresh ( undefiled ) tomb , which he had hewn in the rock ; and he rolled a big boulder over the door of the tomb and went away .
40027061	And Mary of Magdala and the other Mary kept sitting there opposite the tomb .
40027062	The next day , that is , the day after the day of Preparation [ for the Sabbath ] , the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate
40027063	And said , Sir , we have just remembered how that vagabond Imposter said while He was still alive , After three days I will rise again .
40027064	Therefore give an order to have the tomb made secure and safeguarded until the third day , for fear that His disciples will come and steal Him away and tell the people that He has risen from the dead , and the last deception and fraud will be worse than the first .
40027065	Pilate said to them , You have a guard [ of soldiers ; take them and ] go , make it as secure as you can .
40027066	So they went off and made the tomb secure by sealing the boulder , a guard of soldiers being with them and remaining to watch .
40028001	NOW AFTER the Sabbath , near dawn of the first day of the week , Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb .
40028002	And behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled the boulder back and sat upon it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his garments as white as snow .
40028004	And those keeping guard were so frightened at the sight of him that they were agitated and they trembled and became like dead men .
40028005	But the angel said to the women , Do not be alarmed and frightened , for I know that you are looking for Jesus , Who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here ; He has risen , as He said [ He would do ] . Come , see the place where He lay .
40028007	Then go quickly and tell His disciples , He has risen from the dead , and behold , He is going before you to Galilee ; there you will see Him . Behold , I have told you .
40028008	So they left the tomb hastily with fear and great joy and ran to tell the disciples .
40028009	And as they went , behold , Jesus met them and said , Hail ( greetings ) ! And they went up to Him and clasped His feet and worshiped Him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , Do not be alarmed and afraid ; go and tell My brethren to go into Galilee , and there they will see Me .
40028011	While they were on their way , behold , some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had occurred .
40028012	And when they [ the chief priests ] had gathered with the elders and had consulted together , they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers ,
40028013	And said , Tell people , His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping .
40028014	And if the governor hears of it , we will appease him and make you safe and free from trouble and care .
40028015	So they took the money and did as they were instructed ; and this story has been current among the Jews to the present day .
40028016	Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain to which Jesus had directed and made appointment with them .
40028017	And when they saw Him , they fell down and worshiped Him ; but some doubted .
40028018	Jesus approached and , breaking the silence , said to them , All authority ( all power of rule ) in heaven and on earth has been given to Me .
40028019	Go then and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	Teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you , and behold , I am with you all the days ( perpetually , uniformly , and on every occasion ) , to the [ very ] close and consummation of the age . Amen ( so let it be ) .
41001001	THE BEGINNING [ of the facts ] of the good news ( the Gospel ) of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah : Behold , I send My messenger before Your face , who will make ready Your way --
41001003	A voice of one crying in the wilderness [ shouting in the desert ] , Prepare the way of the Lord , make His beaten tracks straight ( level and passable ) !
41001004	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness ( desert ) , preaching a baptism [ obligating ] repentance ( a change of one’s mind for the better , heartily amending one’s ways , with abhorrence of his past sins ) in order to obtain forgiveness of and release from sins .
41001005	And there kept going out to him [ continuously ] all the country of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan , as they were confessing their sins .
41001006	And John wore clothing woven of camel’s hair and had a leather girdle around his loins and ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	And he preached , saying , After me comes He Who is stronger ( more powerful and more valiant ) than I , the strap of Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to stoop down and unloose .
41001008	I have baptized you with water , but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit .
41001009	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	And when He came up out of the water , at once he [ John ] saw the heavens torn open and the [ Holy ] Spirit like a dove coming down [ to enter ] into Him .
41001011	And there came a voice out from within heaven , You are My Beloved Son ; in You I am well pleased .
41001012	Immediately the [ Holy ] Spirit [ from within ] drove Him out into the wilderness ( desert ) ,
41001013	And He stayed in the wilderness ( desert ) forty days , being tempted [ all the while ] by Satan ; and He was with the wild beasts , and the angels ministered to Him [ continually ] .
41001014	Now after John was arrested and put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom of God ,
41001015	And saying , The [ appointed period of ] time is fulfilled ( completed ) , and the kingdom of God is at hand ; repent ( have a change of mind which issues in regret for past sins and in change of conduct for the better ) and believe ( trust in , rely on , and adhere to ) the good news ( the Gospel ) .
41001016	And passing along the shore of the Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon [ Peter ] and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net [ to and fro ] in the sea , for they were fishermen .
41001017	And Jesus said to them , Come after Me and be My disciples , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
41001018	And at once they left their nets and [ yielding up all claim to them ] followed [ with ] Him [ joining Him as disciples and siding with His party ] .
41001019	He went on a little farther and saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who were in [ their ] boat putting their nets in order .
41001020	And immediately He called out to them , and [ abandoning all mutual claims ] they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after Him [ to be His disciples , side with His party , and follow Him ] .
41001021	And they entered into Capernaum , and immediately on the Sabbath He went into the synagogue and began to teach .
41001022	And they were completely astonished at His teaching , for He was teaching as One Who possessed authority , and not as the scribes .
41001023	Just at that time there was in their synagogue a man [ who was in the power ] of an unclean spirit ; and now [ immediately ] he raised a deep and terrible cry from the depths of his throat , saying ,
41001024	What have You to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are -- the Holy One of God !
41001025	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hush up ( be muzzled , gagged ) , and come out of him !
41001026	And the unclean spirit , throwing the man into convulsions and screeching with a loud voice , came out of him .
41001027	And they were all so amazed and almost terrified that they kept questioning and demanding one of another , saying , What is this ? What new ( fresh ) teaching ! With authority He gives orders even to the unclean spirits and they obey Him !
41001028	And immediately rumors concerning Him spread [ everywhere ] throughout all the region surrounding Galilee .
41001029	And at once He left the synagogue and went into the house of Simon [ Peter ] and Andrew , accompanied by James and John .
41001030	Now Simon’s mother-in-law had for some time been lying sick with a fever , and at once they told Him about her .
41001031	And He went up to her and took her by the hand and raised her up ; and the fever left her , and she began to wait on them .
41001032	Now when it was evening , after the sun had set , they brought to Him all who were sick and those under the power of demons ,
41001033	Until the whole town was gathered together about the door .
41001034	And He cured many who were afflicted with various diseases ; and He drove out many demons , but would not allow the demons to talk because they knew Him [ intuitively ] .
41001035	And in the morning , long before daylight , He got up and went out to a deserted place , and there He prayed .
41001036	And Simon [ Peter ] and those who were with him followed Him [ pursuing Him eagerly and hunting Him out ] ,
41001037	And they found Him and said to Him , Everybody is looking for You .
41001038	And He said to them , Let us be going on into the neighboring country towns , that I may preach there also ; for that is why I came out .
41001039	[ So ] He went throughout the whole of Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons .
41001040	And a leper came to Him , begging Him on his knees and saying to Him , If You are willing , You are able to make me clean .
41001041	And being moved with pity and sympathy , Jesus reached out His hand and touched him , and said to him , I am willing ; be made clean !
41001042	And at once the leprosy [ completely ] left him and he was made clean [ by being healed ] .
41001043	And Jesus charged him sternly ( sharply and threateningly , and with earnest admonition ) and [ acting with deep feeling thrust him forth and ] sent him away at once ,
41001044	And said to him , See that you tell nothing [ of this ] to anyone ; but begone , show yourself to the priest , and offer for your purification what Moses commanded , as a proof ( an evidence and witness ) to the people [ that you are really healed ] .
41001045	But he went out and began to talk so freely about it and blaze abroad the news [ spreading it everywhere ] that [ Jesus ] could no longer openly go into a town but was outside in [ lonely ] desert places . But the people kept on coming to Him from all sides and every quarter .
41002001	AND JESUS having returned to Capernaum , after some days it was rumored about that He was in the house [ probably Peter’s ] .
41002002	And so many people gathered together there that there was no longer room [ for them ] , not even around the door ; and He was discussing the Word .
41002003	Then they came , bringing a paralytic to Him , who had been picked up and was being carried by four men .
41002004	And when they could not get him to a place in front of Jesus because of the throng , they dug through the roof above Him ; and when they had scooped out an opening , they let down the [ thickly padded ] quilt or mat upon which the paralyzed man lay .
41002005	And when Jesus saw their faith [ their confidence in God through Him ] , He said to the paralyzed man , Son , your sins are forgiven [ you ] and put away [ that is , the penalty is remitted , the sense of guilt removed , and you are made upright and in right standing with God ] .
41002006	Now some of the scribes were sitting there , holding a dialogue with themselves as they questioned in their hearts ,
41002007	Why does this Man talk like this ? He is blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins [ remove guilt , remit the penalty , and bestow righteousness instead ] except God alone ?
41002008	And at once Jesus , becoming fully aware in His spirit that they thus debated within themselves , said to them , Why do you argue ( debate , reason ) about all this in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is easier : to say to the paralyzed man , Your sins are forgiven and put away , or to say , Rise , take up your sleeping pad or mat , and start walking about [ and keep on walking ] ?
41002010	But that you may know positively and beyond a doubt that the Son of Man has right and authority and power on earth to forgive sins -- He said to the paralyzed man ,
41002011	I say to you , arise , pick up and carry your sleeping pad or mat , and be going on home .
41002012	And he arose at once and picked up the sleeping pad or mat and went out before them all , so that they were all amazed and recognized and praised and thanked God , saying , We have never seen anything like this before !
41002013	[ Jesus ] went out again along the seashore ; and all the multitude kept gathering about Him , and He kept teaching them .
41002014	And as He was passing by , He saw Levi ( Matthew ) son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office , and He said to him , Follow Me ! [ Be joined to Me as a disciple , side with My party ! ] And he arose and joined Him as His disciple and sided with His party and accompanied Him .
41002015	And as Jesus , together with His disciples , sat at table in his [ Levi’s ] house , many tax collectors and persons [ definitely stained ] with sin were dining with Him , for there were many who walked the same road ( followed ) with Him .
41002016	And the scribes [ belonging to the party ] of the Pharisees , when they saw that He was eating with [ those definitely known to be especially wicked ] sinners and tax collectors , said to His disciples , Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and [ notorious ] sinners ?
41002017	And when Jesus heard it , He said to them , Those who are strong and well have no need of a physician , but those who are weak and sick ; I came not to call the righteous ones to repentance , but sinners ( the erring ones and all those not free from sin ) .
41002018	Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were observing a fast ; and [ some people ] came and asked Jesus , Why are John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting , but Your disciples are not doing so ?
41002019	Jesus answered them , Can the wedding guests fast ( abstain from food and drink ) while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
41002020	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and they will fast in that day .
41002021	No one sews a patch of unshrunken ( new ) goods on an old garment ; if he does , the patch tears away from it , the new from the old , and the rent ( tear ) becomes bigger and worse [ than it was before ] .
41002022	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; if he does , the wine will burst the skins , and the wine is lost and the bottles destroyed ; but new wine is to be put in new ( fresh ) wineskins .
41002023	One Sabbath He was going along beside the fields of standing grain , and as they made their way , His disciples began to pick off the grains .
41002024	And the Pharisees said to Him , Look ! Why are they doing what is not permitted or lawful on the Sabbath ?
41002025	And He said to them , Have you never [ even ] read what David did when he was in need and was hungry , he and those who were accompanying him ? --
41002026	How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was the high priest , and ate the sacred loaves set forth [ before God ] , which it is not permitted or lawful for any but the priests to eat , and [ how he ] also gave [ them ] to those who were with him ?
41002027	And Jesus said to them , The Sabbath was made on account and for the sake of man , not man for the Sabbath ;
41002028	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath .
41003001	AGAIN JESUS went into a synagogue , and a man was there who had one withered hand [ as the result of accident or disease ] .
41003002	And [ the Pharisees ] kept watching Jesus [ closely ] to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath , so that they might get a charge to bring against Him [ formally ] .
41003003	And He said to the man who had the withered hand , Get up [ and stand here ] in the midst .
41003004	And He said to them , Is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to take it ? But they kept silence .
41003005	And He glanced around at them with vexation and anger , grieved at the hardening of their hearts , and said to the man , Hold out your hand . He held it out , and his hand was [ completely ] restored .
41003006	Then the Pharisees went out and immediately held a consultation with the Herodians against Him , how they might [ devise some means to ] put Him to death .
41003007	And Jesus retired with His disciples to the lake , and a great throng from Galilee followed Him . Also from Judea
41003008	And from Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon -- a vast multitude , hearing all the many things that He was doing , came to Him .
41003009	And He told His disciples to have a little boat in [ constant ] readiness for Him because of the crowd , lest they press hard upon Him and crush Him .
41003010	For He had healed so many that all who had distressing bodily diseases kept falling upon Him and pressing upon Him in order that they might touch Him .
41003011	And the spirits , the unclean ones , as often as they might see Him , fell down before Him and kept screaming out , You are the Son of God !
41003012	And He charged them strictly and severely under penalty again and again that they should not make Him known .
41003013	And He went up on the hillside and called to Him [ for Himself ] those whom He wanted and chose , and they came to Him .
41003014	And He appointed twelve to continue to be with Him , and that He might send them out to preach [ as apostles or special messengers ]
41003015	And to have authority and power to heal the sick and to drive out demons :
41003016	[ They were ] Simon , and He surnamed [ him ] Peter ;
41003017	James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James , and He surnamed them Boanerges , that is , Sons of Thunder ;
41003018	And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew ( Nathaniel ) , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ( Judas , not Iscariot ) , and Simon the Cananaean [ also called Zelotes ] ,
41003019	And Judas Iscariot , he who betrayed Him .
41003020	Then He went to a house [ probably Peter’s ] , but a throng came together again , so that Jesus and His disciples could not even take food .
41003021	And when those who belonged to Him ( His kinsmen ) heard it , they went out to take Him by force , for they kept saying , He is out of His mind ( beside Himself , deranged ) !
41003022	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , He is possessed by Beelzebub , and , By [ the help of ] the prince of demons He is casting out demons .
41003023	And He summoned them to Him and said to them in parables ( illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them ) , How can Satan drive out Satan ?
41003024	And if a kingdom is divided and rebelling against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
41003025	And if a house is divided ( split into factions and rebelling ) against itself , that house will not be able to last .
41003026	And if Satan has raised an insurrection against himself and is divided , he cannot stand but is [ surely ] coming to an end .
41003027	But no one can go into a strong man’s house and ransack his household goods right and left and seize them as plunder unless he first binds the strong man ; then indeed he may [ thoroughly ] plunder his house .
41003028	Truly and solemnly I say to you , all sins will be forgiven the sons of men , and whatever abusive and blasphemous things they utter ;
41003029	But whoever speaks abusively against or maliciously misrepresents the Holy Spirit can never get forgiveness , but is guilty of and is in the grasp of an everlasting trespass .
41003030	For they persisted in saying , He has an unclean spirit .
41003031	Then His mother and His brothers came and , standing outside , they sent word to Him , calling [ for ] Him .
41003032	And a crowd was sitting around Him , and they said to Him , Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are outside asking for You .
41003033	And He replied , Who are My mother and My brothers ?
41003034	And looking around on those who sat in a circle about Him , He said , See ! Here are My mother and My brothers ;
41003035	For whoever does the things God wills is My brother and sister and mother !
41004001	AGAIN JESUS began to teach beside the lake . And a very great crowd gathered about Him , so that He got into a ship in order to sit in it on the sea , and the whole crowd was at the lakeside on the shore .
41004002	And He taught them many things in parables ( illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them ) , and in His teaching He said to them :
41004003	Give attention to this ! Behold , a sower went out to sow .
41004004	And as he was sowing , some seed fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
41004005	Other seed [ of the same kind ] fell on ground full of rocks , where it had not much soil ; and at once it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil ;
41004006	And when the sun came up , it was scorched , and because it had not taken root , it withered away .
41004007	Other seed [ of the same kind ] fell among thorn plants , and the thistles grew and pressed together and utterly choked and suffocated it , and it yielded no grain .
41004008	And other seed [ of the same kind ] fell into good ( well-adapted ) soil and brought forth grain , growing up and increasing , and yielded up to thirty times as much , and sixty times as much , and even a hundred times as much as had been sown .
41004009	And He said , He who has ears to hear , let him be hearing [ and let him consider , and comprehend ] .
41004010	And as soon as He was alone , those who were around Him , with the Twelve [ apostles ] , began to ask Him about the parables .
41004011	And He said to them , To you has been entrusted the mystery of the kingdom of God [ that is , the secret counsels of God which are hidden from the ungodly ] ; but for those outside [ of our circle ] everything becomes a parable ,
41004012	In order that they may [ indeed ] look and look but not see and perceive , and may hear and hear but not grasp and comprehend , lest haply they should turn again , and it [ their willful rejection of the truth ] should be forgiven them .
41004013	And He said to them , Do you not discern and understand this parable ? How then is it possible for you to discern and understand all the parables ?
41004014	The sower sows the Word .
41004015	The ones along the path are those who have the Word sown [ in their hearts ] , but when they hear , Satan comes at once and [ by force ] takes away the message which is sown in them .
41004016	And in the same way the ones sown upon stony ground are those who , when they hear the Word , at once receive and accept and welcome it with joy ;
41004017	And they have no real root in themselves , and so they endure for a little while ; then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the Word , they immediately are offended ( become displeased , indignant , resentful ) and they stumble and fall away .
41004018	And the ones sown among the thorns are others who hear the Word ;
41004019	Then the cares and anxieties of the world and distractions of the age , and the pleasure and delight and false glamour and deceitfulness of riches , and the craving and passionate desire for other things creep in and choke and suffocate the Word , and it becomes fruitless .
41004020	And those sown on the good ( well-adapted ) soil are the ones who hear the Word and receive and accept and welcome it and bear fruit -- some thirty times as much as was sown , some sixty times as much , and some [ even ] a hundred times as much .
41004021	And He said to them , Is the lamp brought in to be put under a peck measure or under a bed , and not [ to be put ] on the lampstand ?
41004022	[ Things are hidden temporarily only as a means to revelation . ] For there is nothing hidden except to be revealed , nor is anything [ temporarily ] kept secret except in order that it may be made known .
41004023	If any man has ears to hear , let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend .
41004024	And He said to them , Be careful what you are hearing . The measure [ of thought and study ] you give [ to the truth you hear ] will be the measure [ of virtue and knowledge ] that comes back to you -- and more [ besides ] will be given to you who hear .
41004025	For to him who has will more be given ; and from him who has nothing , even what he has will be taken away [ by force ] ,
41004026	And He said , The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed upon the ground ,
41004027	And then continues sleeping and rising night and day while the seed sprouts and grows and increases -- he knows not how .
41004028	The earth produces [ acting ] by itself -- first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
41004029	But when the grain is ripe and permits , immediately he sends forth [ the reapers ] and puts in the sickle , because the harvest stands ready .
41004030	And He said , With what can we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it ?
41004031	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when sown upon the ground , is the smallest of all seeds upon the earth ;
41004032	Yet after it is sown , it grows up and becomes the greatest of all garden herbs and puts out large branches , so that the birds of the air are able to make nests and dwell in its shade .
41004033	With many such parables [ Jesus ] spoke the Word to them , as they were able to hear and to comprehend and understand .
41004034	He did not tell them anything without a parable ; but privately to His disciples ( those who were peculiarly His own ) He explained everything [ fully ] .
41004035	On that same day [ when ] evening had come , He said to them , Let us go over to the other side [ of the lake ] .
41004036	And leaving the throng , they took Him with them , [ just ] as He was , in the boat [ in which He was sitting ] . And other boats were with Him .
41004037	And a furious storm of wind [ of hurricane proportions ] arose , and the waves kept beating into the boat , so that it was already becoming filled .
41004038	But He [ Himself ] was in the stern [ of the boat ] , asleep on the [ leather ] cushion ; and they awoke Him and said to Him , Master , do You not care that we are perishing ?
41004039	And He arose and rebuked the wind and said to the sea , Hush now ! Be still ( muzzled ) ! And the wind ceased ( sank to rest as if exhausted by its beating ) and there was [ immediately ] a great calm ( a perfect peacefulness ) .
41004040	He said to them , Why are you so timid and fearful ? How is it that you have no faith ( no firmly relying trust ) ?
41004041	And they were filled with great awe and feared exceedingly and said one to another , Who then is this , that even wind and sea obey Him ?
41005001	THEY CAME to the other side of the sea to the region of the Gerasenes .
41005002	And as soon as He got out of the boat , there met Him out of the tombs a man [ under the power ] of an unclean spirit .
41005003	This man continually lived among the tombs , and no one could subdue him any more , even with a chain ;
41005004	For he had been bound often with shackles for the feet and handcuffs , but the handcuffs of [ light ] chains he wrenched apart , and the shackles he rubbed and ground together and broke in pieces ; and no one had strength enough to restrain or tame him .
41005005	Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always shrieking and screaming and beating and bruising and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	And when from a distance he saw Jesus , he ran and fell on his knees before Him in homage ,
41005007	And crying out with a loud voice , he said , What have You to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? [ What is there in common between us ? ] I solemnly implore you by God , do not begin to torment me !
41005008	For Jesus was commanding , Come out of the man , you unclean spirit !
41005009	And He asked him , What is your name ? He replied , My name is Legion , for we are many .
41005010	And he kept begging Him urgently not to send them [ himself and the other demons ] away out of that region .
41005011	Now a great herd of hogs was grazing there on the hillside .
41005012	And the demons begged Him , saying , Send us to the hogs , that we may go into them !
41005013	So He gave them permission . And the unclean spirits came out [ of the man ] and entered into the hogs ; and the herd , numbering about 2,000 , rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea .
41005014	The hog feeders ran away , and told [ it ] in the town and in the country . And [ the people ] came to see what it was that had taken place .
41005015	And they came to Jesus and looked intently and searchingly at the man who had been a demoniac , sitting there , clothed and in his right mind , [ the same man ] who had had the legion [ of demons ] ; and they were seized with alarm and struck with fear .
41005016	And those who had seen it related in full what had happened to the man possessed by demons and to the hogs .
41005017	And they began to beg [ Jesus ] to leave their neighborhood .
41005018	And when He had stepped into the boat , the man who had been controlled by the unclean spirits kept begging Him that he might be with Him .
41005019	But Jesus refused to permit him , but said to him , Go home to your own [ family and relatives and friends ] and bring back word to them of how much the Lord has done for you , and [ how He has ] had sympathy for you and mercy on you .
41005020	And he departed and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [ the region of the ten cities ] how much Jesus had done for him , and all the people were astonished and marveled .
41005021	And when Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side , a great throng gathered about Him , and He was at the lakeshore .
41005022	Then one of the rulers of the synagogue came up , Jairus by name ; and seeing Him , he prostrated himself at His feet
41005023	And begged Him earnestly , saying , My little daughter is at the point of death . Come and lay Your hands on her , so that she may be healed and live .
41005024	And Jesus went with him ; and a great crowd kept following Him and pressed Him from all sides [ so as almost to suffocate Him ] .
41005025	And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years ,
41005026	And who had endured much suffering under [ the hands of ] many physicians and had spent all that she had , and was no better but instead grew worse .
41005027	She had heard the reports concerning Jesus , and she came up behind Him in the throng and touched His garment ,
41005028	For she kept saying , If I only touch His garments , I shall be restored to health .
41005029	And immediately her flow of blood was dried up at the source , and [ suddenly ] she felt in her body that she was healed of her [ distressing ] ailment .
41005030	And Jesus , recognizing in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth , turned around immediately in the crowd and said , Who touched My clothes ?
41005031	And the disciples kept saying to Him , You see the crowd pressing hard around You from all sides , and You ask , Who touched Me ?
41005032	Still He kept looking around to see her who had done it .
41005033	But the woman , knowing what had been done for her , though alarmed and frightened and trembling , fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
41005034	And He said to her , Daughter , your faith ( your trust and confidence in Me , springing from faith in God ) has restored you to health . Go in ( into ) peace and be continually healed and freed from your [ distressing bodily ] disease .
41005035	While He was still speaking , there came some from the ruler’s house , who said [ to Jairus ] , Your daughter has died . Why bother and distress the Teacher any further ?
41005036	Overhearing but ignoring what they said , Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue , Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear ; only keep on believing .
41005037	And He permitted no one to accompany Him except Peter and James and John the brother of James .
41005038	When they arrived at the house of the ruler of the synagogue , He looked [ carefully and with understanding ] at [ the ] tumult and the people weeping and wailing loudly .
41005039	And when He had gone in , He said to them , Why do you make an uproar and weep ? The little girl is not dead but is sleeping .
41005040	And they laughed and jeered at Him . But He put them all out , and , taking the child’s father and mother and those who were with Him , He went in where the little girl was lying .
41005041	Gripping her [ firmly ] by the hand , He said to her , Talitha cumi -- which translated is , Little girl , I say to you , arise [ from the sleep of death ] !
41005042	And instantly the girl got up and started walking around -- for she was twelve years old . And they were utterly astonished and overcome with amazement .
41005043	And He strictly commanded and warned them that no one should know this , and He [ expressly ] told them to give her [ something ] to eat .
41006001	JESUS WENT away from there and came to His [ own ] country and hometown [ Nazareth ] , and His disciples followed [ with ] Him .
41006002	And on the Sabbath He began to teach in the synagogue ; and many who listened to Him were utterly astonished , saying , Where did this Man acquire all this ? What is the wisdom [ the broad and full intelligence which has been ] given to Him ? What mighty works and exhibitions of power are wrought by His hands !
41006003	Is not this the Carpenter , the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? And are not His sisters here among us ? And they took offense at Him and were hurt [ that is , they disapproved of Him , and it hindered them from acknowledging His authority ] and they were caused to stumble and fall .
41006004	But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honor ( deference , reverence ) except in his [ own ] country and among [ his ] relatives and in his [ own ] house .
41006005	And He was not able to do even one work of power there , except that He laid His hands on a few sickly people [ and ] cured them .
41006006	And He marveled because of their unbelief ( their lack of faith in Him ) . And He went about among the surrounding villages and continued teaching .
41006007	And He called to Him the Twelve [ apostles ] and began to send them out [ as His ambassadors ] two by two and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits .
41006008	He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick -- no bread , no wallet for a collection bag , no money in their belts ( girdles , purses ) --
41006009	But to go with sandals on their feet and not to put on two tunics ( undergarments ) .
41006010	And He told them , Wherever you go into a house , stay there until you leave that place .
41006011	And if any community will not receive and accept and welcome you , and they refuse to listen to you , when you depart , shake off the dust that is on your feet , for a testimony against them . Truly I tell you , it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment day than for that town .
41006012	So they went out and preached that men should repent [ that they should change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways , with abhorrence of their past sins ] .
41006013	And they drove out many unclean spirits and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them .
41006014	King Herod heard of it , for [ Jesus’ ] name had become well known . He and they [ of his court ] said , John the Baptist has been raised from the dead ; that is why these mighty powers [ of performing miracles ] are at work in Him .
41006015	[ But ] others kept saying , It is Elijah ! And others said , It is a prophet , like one of the prophets [ of old ] .
41006016	But when Herod heard [ of it ] , he said , [ This very ] John , whom I beheaded , has been raised [ from the dead ] .
41006017	For [ this ] Herod himself had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip’s wife , because he [ Herod ] had married her .
41006018	For John had told Herod , It is not lawful and you have no right to have your brother’s wife .
41006019	And Herodias was angry ( enraged ) with him and held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him ; but she could not ,
41006020	For Herod had [ a reverential ] fear of John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and [ continually ] kept him safe [ under guard ] . When he heard , he was much perplexed ; and [ yet ] he heard him gladly .
41006021	But an opportune time came [ for Herodias ] when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and the high military commanders and chief men of Galilee .
41006022	For when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased and fascinated Herod and his guests ; and the king said to the girl , Ask me for whatever you desire , and I will give it to you .
41006023	And he put himself under oath to her , Whatever you ask me , I will give it to you , even to the half of my kingdom .
41006024	Then she left the room and said to her mother , What shall I ask for [ myself ] ? And she replied , The head of John the Baptist !
41006025	And she rushed back instantly to the king and requested , saying , I wish you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter .
41006026	And the king was deeply pained and grieved and exceedingly sorry , but because of his oaths and his guests , he did not want to slight her [ by breaking faith with her ] .
41006027	And immediately the king sent off one [ of the soldiers ] of his bodyguard and gave him orders to bring [ John’s ] head . He went and beheaded him in the prison
41006028	And brought his head on a platter and handed it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	When his disciples learned of it , they came and took [ John’s ] body and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles [ sent out as missionaries ] came back and gathered together to Jesus , and told Him all that they had done and taught .
41006031	And He said to them , [ As for you ] come away by yourselves to a deserted place , and rest a while -- for many were [ continually ] coming and going , and they had not even leisure enough to eat .
41006032	And they went away in a boat to a solitary place by themselves .
41006033	Now many [ people ] saw them going and recognized them , and they ran there on foot from all the surrounding towns , and they got there ahead [ of those in the boat ] .
41006034	As Jesus landed , He saw a great crowd waiting , and He was moved with compassion for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd ; and He began to teach them many things .
41006035	And when the day was already far gone , His disciples came to Him and said , This is a desolate and isolated place , and the hour is now late .
41006036	Send the crowds away to go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat .
41006037	But He replied to them , Give them something to eat yourselves . And they said to Him , Shall we go and buy 200 denarii [ about forty dollars ] worth of bread and give it to them to eat ?
41006038	And He said to them , How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . And when they [ had looked and ] knew , they said , Five [ loaves ] and two fish .
41006039	Then He commanded the people all to recline on the green grass by companies .
41006040	So they threw themselves down in ranks of hundreds and fifties [ with the regularity of an arrangement of beds of herbs , looking like so many garden plots ] .
41006041	And taking the five loaves and two fish , He looked up to heaven and , praising God , gave thanks and broke the loaves and kept on giving them to the disciples to set before the people ; and He [ also ] divided the two fish among [ them ] all .
41006042	And they all ate and were satisfied .
41006043	And they took up twelve [ small hand ] baskets full of broken pieces [ from the loaves ] and of the fish .
41006044	And those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men .
41006045	And at once He insisted that the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida , while He was sending the throng away .
41006046	And after He had taken leave of them , He went off into the hills to pray .
41006047	Now when evening had come , the boat was out in the middle of the lake , and He was by Himself on the land .
41006048	And having seen that they were troubled and tormented in [ their ] rowing , for the wind was against them , about the fourth watch of the night [ between 3:00 - 6:00 a.m. ] He came to them , walking [ directly ] on the sea . And He acted as if He meant to pass by them ,
41006049	But when they saw Him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost , and raised a [ deep , throaty ] shriek of terror .
41006050	For they all saw Him and were agitated ( troubled and filled with fear and dread ) . But immediately He talked with them and said , Take heart ! I AM ! Stop being alarmed and afraid .
41006051	And He went up into the boat with them , and the wind ceased ( sank to rest as if exhausted by its own beating ) . And they were astonished exceedingly [ beyond measure ] ,
41006052	For they failed to consider or understand [ the teaching and meaning of the miracle of ] the loaves ; [ in fact ] their hearts had grown callous [ had become dull and had lost the power of understanding ] .
41006053	And when they had crossed over , they reached the land of Gennesaret and came to [ anchor at ] the shore .
41006054	As soon as they got out of the boat , [ the people ] recognized Him ,
41006055	And they ran about the whole countryside , and began to carry around sick people on their sleeping pads or mats to any place where they heard that He was .
41006056	And wherever He came into villages or cities or the country , they would lay the sick in the marketplaces and beg Him that they might touch even the fringe of His outer garment , and as many as touched Him were restored to health .
41007001	NOW THERE gathered together to [ Jesus ] the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem ,
41007002	For they had seen that some of His disciples ate with common hands , that is , unwashed [ with hands defiled and unhallowed , because they had not given them a ceremonial washing ] --
41007003	For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat unless [ merely for ceremonial reasons ] they wash their hands [ diligently up to the elbow ] with clenched fist , adhering [ carefully and faithfully ] to the tradition of [ practices and customs handed down to them by ] their forefathers [ to be observed ] .
41007004	And [ when they come ] from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they purify themselves ; and there are many other traditions [ oral , man-made laws handed down to them , which they observe faithfully and diligently , such as ] , the washing of cups and wooden pitchers and widemouthed jugs and utensils of copper and beds --
41007005	And the Pharisees and scribes kept asking [ Jesus ] , Why do Your disciples not order their way of living according to the tradition handed down by the forefathers [ to be observed ] , but eat with hands unwashed and ceremonially not purified ?
41007006	But He said to them , Excellently and truly [ so that there will be no room for blame ] did Isaiah prophesy of you , the pretenders and hypocrites , as it stands written : These people [ constantly ] honor Me with their lips , but their hearts hold off and are far distant from Me .
41007007	In vain ( fruitlessly and without profit ) do they worship Me , ordering and teaching [ to be obeyed ] as doctrines the commandments and precepts of men .
41007008	You disregard and give up and ask to depart from you the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men [ keeping it carefully and faithfully ] .
41007009	And He said to them , You have a fine way of rejecting [ thus thwarting and nullifying and doing away with ] the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition ( your own human regulations ) !
41007010	For Moses said , Honor ( revere with tenderness of feeling and deference ) your father and your mother , and , He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother , let him surely die .
41007011	But [ as for you ] you say , A man is exempt if he tells [ his ] father or [ his ] mother , What you would otherwise have gained from me [ everything I have that would have been of use to you ] is Corban , that is , is a gift [ already given as an offering to God ] ,
41007012	Then you no longer are permitting him to do anything for [ his ] father or mother [ but are letting him off from helping them ] .
41007013	Thus you are nullifying and making void and of no effect [ the authority of ] the Word of God through your tradition , which you [ in turn ] hand on . And many things of this kind you are doing .
41007014	And He called the people to [ Him ] again and said to them , Listen to Me , all of you , and understand [ what I say ] .
41007015	There is not [ even ] one thing outside a man which by going into him can pollute and defile him ; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him and make him unhallowed and unclean .
41007016	If any man has ears to hear , let him be listening [ and let him perceive and comprehend by hearing ] .
41007017	And when He had left the crowd and had gone into the house , His disciples began asking Him about the parable .
41007018	And He said to them , Then are you also unintelligent and dull and without understanding ? Do you not discern and see that whatever goes into a man from the outside cannot make him unhallowed or unclean ,
41007019	Since it does not reach and enter his heart but [ only his ] digestive tract , and so passes on [ into the place designed to receive waste ] ? Thus He was making and declaring all foods [ ceremonially ] clean [ that is , abolishing the ceremonial distinctions of the Levitical Law ] .
41007020	And He said , What comes out of a man is what makes a man unclean and renders [ him ] unhallowed .
41007021	For from within , [ that is ] out of the hearts of men , come base and wicked thoughts , sexual immorality , stealing , murder , adultery ,
41007022	Coveting ( a greedy desire to have more wealth ) , dangerous and destructive wickedness , deceit ; unrestrained ( indecent ) conduct ; an evil eye ( envy ) , slander ( evil speaking , malicious misrepresentation , abusiveness ) , pride ( the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man ) , foolishness ( folly , lack of sense , recklessness , thoughtlessness ) .
41007023	All these evil [ purposes and desires ] come from within , and they make the man unclean and render him unhallowed .
41007024	And Jesus arose and went away from there to the region of Tyre and Sidon . And He went into a house and did not want anyone to know [ that He was there ] ; but it was not possible for Him to be hidden [ from public notice ] .
41007025	Instead , at once , a woman whose little daughter had ( was under the control of ) an unclean spirit heard about Him and came and flung herself down at His feet .
41007026	Now the woman was a Greek ( Gentile ) , a Syrophoenician by nationality . And she kept begging Him to drive the demon out of her little daughter .
41007027	And He said to her , First let the children be fed , for it is not becoming or proper or right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the [ little house ] dogs .
41007028	But she answered Him , Yes , Lord , yet even the small pups under the table eat the little children’s scraps of food .
41007029	And He said to her , Because of this saying , you may go your way ; the demon has gone out of your daughter [ permanently ] .
41007030	And she went home and found the child thrown on the couch , and the demon departed .
41007031	Soon after this , Jesus , coming back from the region of Tyre , passed through Sidon on to the Sea of Galilee , through the region of Decapolis [ the ten cities ] .
41007032	And they brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty in speaking , and they begged Jesus to place His hand upon him .
41007033	And taking him aside from the crowd [ privately ] , He thrust His fingers into the man’s ears and spat and touched his tongue ;
41007034	And looking up to heaven , He sighed as He said , Ephphatha , which means , Be opened !
41007035	And his ears were opened , his tongue was loosed , and he began to speak distinctly and as he should .
41007036	And Jesus [ in His own interest ] admonished and ordered them sternly and expressly to tell no one ; but the more He commanded them , the more zealously they proclaimed it .
41007037	And they were overwhelmingly astonished , saying , He has done everything excellently ( commendably and nobly ) ! He even makes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak !
41008001	IN THOSE days when [ again ] an immense crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called His disciples to Him and told them ,
41008002	I have pity and sympathy for the people and My heart goes out to them , for they have been with Me now three days and have nothing [ left ] to eat ;
41008003	And if I send them away to their homes hungry , they will be feeble through exhaustion and faint along the road ; and some of them have come a long way .
41008004	And His disciples replied to Him , How can anyone fill and satisfy [ these people ] with loaves of bread here in [ this ] desolate and uninhabited region ?
41008005	And He asked them , How many loaves have you ? They said , Seven .
41008006	And He commanded the multitude to recline upon the ground , and He [ then ] took the seven loaves [ of bread ] and , having given thanks , He broke them and kept on giving them to His disciples to put before [ the people ] , and they placed them before the crowd .
41008007	And they had a few small fish ; and when He had praised God and given thanks and asked Him to bless them [ to their use ] , He ordered that these also should be set before [ them ] .
41008008	And they ate and were satisfied ; and they took up seven [ large provision ] baskets full of the broken pieces left over .
41008009	And there were about 4,000 people . And He dismissed them ,
41008010	And at once He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha ( or Magdala ) .
41008011	The Pharisees came and began to argue with and question Him , demanding from Him a sign ( an attesting miracle from heaven ) [ maliciously ] to test Him .
41008012	And He groaned and sighed deeply in His spirit and said , Why does this generation demand a sign ? Positively I say to you , no sign shall be given this generation .
41008013	And He went away and left them and , getting into the boat again , He departed to the other side .
41008014	Now they had [ completely ] forgotten to bring bread , and they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	And Jesus [ repeatedly and expressly ] charged and admonished them , saying , Look out ; keep on your guard and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod and the Herodians .
41008016	And they discussed it and reasoned with one another , It is because we have no bread .
41008017	And being aware [ of it ] , Jesus said to them , Why are you reasoning and saying it is because you have no bread ? Do you not yet discern or understand ? Are your hearts in [ a settled state of ] hardness ?
41008018	Having eyes , do you not see [ with them ] , and having ears , do you not hear and perceive and understand the sense of what is said ? And do you not remember ?
41008019	When I broke the five loaves for the 5,000 , how many [ small hand ] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? They said to Him , Twelve .
41008020	And [ when I broke ] the seven loaves for the 4,000 , how many [ large provision ] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? And they said to Him , Seven .
41008021	And He kept repeating , Do you not yet understand ?
41008022	And they came to Bethsaida . And [ people ] brought to Him a blind man and begged Him to touch him .
41008023	And He caught the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village ; and when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him , He asked him , Do you [ possibly ] see anything ?
41008024	And he looked up and said , I see people , but [ they look ] like trees , walking .
41008025	Then He put His hands on his eyes again ; and the man looked intently [ that is , fixed his eyes on definite objects ] , and he was restored and saw everything distinctly [ even what was at a distance ] .
41008026	And He sent him away to his house , telling [ him ] , Do not [ even ] enter the village or tell anyone there .
41008027	And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way He asked His disciples , Who do people say that I am ?
41008028	And they answered [ Him ] , John the Baptist ; and others [ say ] , Elijah ; but others , one of the prophets .
41008029	And He asked them , But who do you yourselves say that I am ? Peter replied to Him , You are the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
41008030	And He charged them sharply to tell no one about Him .
41008031	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must of necessity suffer many things and be tested and disapproved and rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes , and be put to death , and after three days rise again [ from death ] .
41008032	And He said this freely ( frankly , plainly , and explicitly , making it unmistakable ) . And Peter took Him by the hand and led Him aside and then [ facing Him ] began to rebuke Him .
41008033	But turning around [ His back to Peter ] and seeing His disciples , He rebuked Peter , saying , Get behind Me , Satan ! For you do not have a mind intent on promoting what God wills , but what pleases men [ you are not on God’s side , but that of men ] .
41008034	And Jesus called [ to Him ] the throng with His disciples and said to them , If anyone intends to come after Me , let him deny himself [ forget , ignore , disown , and lose sight of himself and his own interests ] and take up his cross , and [ joining Me as a disciple and siding with My party ] follow with Me [ continually , cleaving steadfastly to Me ] .
41008035	For whoever wants to save his [ higher , spiritual , eternal ] life , will lose it [ the lower , natural , temporal life which is lived only on earth ] ; and whoever gives up his life [ which is lived only on earth ] for My sake and the Gospel’s will save it [ his higher , spiritual life in the eternal kingdom of God ] .
41008036	For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world , and forfeit his life [ in the eternal kingdom of God ] ?
41008037	For what can a man give as an exchange ( a compensation , a ransom , in return ) for his [ blessed ] life [ in the eternal kingdom of God ] ?
41008038	For whoever is ashamed [ here and now ] of Me and My words in this adulterous ( unfaithful ) and [ preeminently ] sinful generation , of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory ( splendor and majesty ) of His Father with the holy angels .
41009001	AND JESUS said to them , Truly and solemnly I say to you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste death before they see the kingdom of God come in [ its ] power .
41009002	Six days after this , Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves . And He was transfigured before them and became resplendent with divine brightness .
41009003	And His garments became glistening , intensely white , as no fuller ( cloth dresser , launderer ) on earth could bleach them .
41009004	And Elijah appeared [ there ] to them , accompanied by Moses , and they were holding [ a protracted ] conversation with Jesus .
41009005	And Peter took up the conversation , saying , Master , it is good and suitable and beautiful for us to be here . Let us make three booths ( tents ) -- one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah .
41009006	For he did not [ really ] know what to say , for they were in a violent fright ( aghast with dread ) .
41009007	And a cloud threw a shadow upon them , and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is My Son , the [ most dearworthy ] Beloved One . Be constantly listening to and obeying Him !
41009008	And looking around , they suddenly no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus only .
41009009	And as they were coming back down the mountain , He admonished and expressly ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man should rise from among the dead .
41009010	So they carefully and faithfully kept the matter to themselves , questioning and disputing with one another about what rising from among the dead meant .
41009011	And they asked Him , Why do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first ?
41009012	And He said to them , Elijah , it is true , does come first to restore all things and set them to rights . And how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be utterly despised and be treated with contempt and rejected ?
41009013	But I tell you that Elijah has already come , and [ people ] did to him whatever they desired , as it is written of him .
41009014	And when they came to the [ nine ] disciples , they saw a great crowd around them and scribes questioning and disputing with them .
41009015	And immediately all the crowd , when they saw Jesus [ returning from the holy mount , His face and person yet glistening ] , they were greatly amazed and ran up to Him [ and ] greeted Him .
41009016	And He asked them , About what are you questioning and discussing with them ?
41009017	And one of the throng replied to Him , Teacher , I brought my son to You , for he has a dumb spirit .
41009018	And wherever it lays hold of him [ so as to make him its own ] , it dashes him down and convulses him , and he foams [ at the mouth ] and grinds his teeth , and he [ falls into a motionless stupor and ] is wasting away . And I asked Your disciples to drive it out , and they were not able [ to do it ] .
41009019	And He answered them , O unbelieving generation [ without any faith ] ! How long shall I [ have to do ] with you ? How long am I to bear with you ? Bring him to Me .
41009020	So they brought [ the boy ] to Him , and when the spirit saw Him , at once it completely convulsed the boy , and he fell to the ground and kept rolling about , foaming [ at the mouth ] .
41009021	And [ Jesus ] asked his father , How long has he had this ? And he answered , From the time he was a little boy .
41009022	And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water , intending to kill him . But if You can do anything , do have pity on us and help us .
41009023	And Jesus said , [ You say to Me ] , If You can do anything ? [ Why , ] all things can be ( are possible ) to him who believes !
41009024	At once the father of the boy gave [ an eager , piercing , inarticulate ] cry with tears , and he said , Lord , I believe ! [ Constantly ] help my weakness of faith !
41009025	But when Jesus noticed that a crowd [ of people ] came running together , He rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , You dumb and deaf spirit , I charge you to come out of him and never go into him again .
41009026	And after giving a [ hoarse , clamoring , fear-stricken ] shriek of anguish and convulsing him terribly , it came out ; and the boy lay [ pale and motionless ] like a corpse , so that many of them said , He is dead .
41009027	But Jesus took [ a strong grip of ] his hand and began lifting him up , and he stood .
41009028	And when He had gone indoors , His disciples asked Him privately , Why could not we drive it out ?
41009029	And He replied to them , This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting .
41009030	They went on from there and passed along through Galilee . And He did not wish to have anyone know it ,
41009031	For He was [ engaged for the time being in ] teaching His disciples . He said to them , The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men , and they will put Him to death ; and when He has been killed , after three days He will rise [ from death ] .
41009032	But they did not comprehend what He was saying , and they were afraid to ask Him [ what this statement meant ] .
41009033	And they arrived at Capernaum ; and when [ they were ] in the house , He asked them , What were you discussing and arguing about on the road ?
41009034	But they kept still , for on the road they had discussed and disputed with one another as to who was the greatest .
41009035	And He sat down and called the Twelve [ apostles ] , and He said to them , If anyone desires to be first , he must be last of all , and servant of all .
41009036	And He took a little child and put him in the center of their group ; and taking him in [ His ] arms , He said to them ,
41009037	Whoever in My name and for My sake accepts and receives and welcomes one such child also accepts and receives and welcomes Me ; and whoever so receives Me receives not only Me but Him Who sent Me .
41009038	John said to Him , Teacher , we saw a man who does not follow along with us driving out demons in Your name , and we forbade him to do it , because he is not one of our band [ of Your disciples ] .
41009039	But Jesus said , Do not restrain or hinder or forbid him ; for no one who does a mighty work in My name will soon afterward be able to speak evil of Me .
41009040	For he who is not against us is for us .
41009041	For I tell you truly , whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to and bear the name of Christ will by no means fail to get his reward .
41009042	And whoever causes one of these little ones ( these believers ) who acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin , it would be better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for him if a [ huge ] millstone were hung about his neck , and he were thrown into the sea .
41009043	And if your hand puts a stumbling block before you and causes you to sin , cut it off ! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to go into life [ that is really worthwhile ] maimed than with two hands to go to hell ( Gehenna ) , into the fire that cannot be put out .
41009045	And if your foot is a cause of stumbling and sin to you , cut it off ! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter into life [ that is really worthwhile ] crippled than , having two feet , to be cast into hell ( Gehenna ) .
41009047	And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin , pluck it out ! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell ( Gehenna ) ,
41009048	Where their worm [ which preys on the inhabitants and is a symbol of the wounds inflicted on the man himself by his sins ] does not die , and the fire is not put out .
41009049	For everyone shall be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good ( beneficial ) , but if salt has lost its saltness , how will you restore [ the saltness to ] it ? Have salt within yourselves , and be at peace and live in harmony with one another .
41010001	AND [ Jesus ] left there [ Capernaum ] and went to the region of Judea and beyond [ east of ] the Jordan ; and crowds [ constantly ] gathered around Him again , and as was His custom , He began to teach them again .
41010002	And some Pharisees came up , and , in order to test Him and try to find a weakness in Him , asked , Is it lawful for a man to dismiss and repudiate and divorce his wife ?
41010003	He answered them , What did Moses command you ?
41010004	They replied , Moses allowed a man to write a bill of divorce and to put her away .
41010005	But Jesus said to them , Because of your hardness of heart [ your condition of insensibility to the call of God ] he wrote you this precept in your Law .
41010006	But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female .
41010007	For this reason a man shall leave [ behind ] his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and cleave closely to her permanently ,
41010008	And the two shall become one flesh , so that they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	What therefore God has united ( joined together ) , let not man separate or divide .
41010010	And indoors the disciples questioned Him again about this subject .
41010011	And He said to them , Whoever dismisses ( repudiates and divorces ) his wife and marries another commits adultery against her ;
41010012	And if a woman dismisses ( repudiates and divorces ) her husband and marries another , she commits adultery .
41010013	And they kept bringing young children to Him that He might touch them , and the disciples were reproving them [ for it ] .
41010014	But when Jesus saw [ it ] , He was indignant and pained and said to them , Allow the children to come to Me -- do not forbid or prevent or hinder them -- for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
41010015	Truly I tell you , whoever does not receive and accept and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [ does ] positively shall not enter it at all .
41010016	And He took them [ the children up one by one ] in His arms and [ fervently invoked a ] blessing , placing His hands upon them .
41010017	And as He was setting out on His journey , a man ran up and knelt before Him and asked Him , Teacher , [ You are essentially and perfectly morally ] good , what must I do to inherit eternal life [ that is , to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah’s kingdom ] ?
41010018	And Jesus said to him , Why do you call Me [ essentially and perfectly morally ] good ? There is no one [ essentially and perfectly morally ] good -- except God alone .
41010019	You know the commandments : Do not kill , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not bear false witness , do not defraud , honor your father and mother .
41010020	And he replied to Him , Teacher , I have carefully guarded and observed all these and taken care not to violate them from my boyhood .
41010021	And Jesus , looking upon him , loved him , and He said to him , You lack one thing ; go and sell all you have and give [ the money ] to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come [ and ] accompany Me [ walking the same road that I walk ] .
41010022	At that saying the man’s countenance fell and was gloomy , and he went away grieved and sorrowing , for he was holding great possessions .
41010023	And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples , With what difficulty will those who possess wealth and keep on holding it enter the kingdom of God !
41010024	And the disciples were amazed and bewildered and perplexed at His words . But Jesus said to them again , Children , how hard it is for those who trust ( place their confidence , their sense of safety ) in riches to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .
41010026	And they were shocked and exceedingly astonished , and said to Him and to one another , Then who can be saved ?
41010027	Jesus glanced around at them and said , With men [ it is ] impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God .
41010028	Peter started to say to Him , Behold , we have yielded up and abandoned everything [ once and for all and joined You as Your disciples , siding with Your party ] and accompanied You [ walking the same road that You walk ] .
41010029	Jesus said , Truly I tell you , there is no one who has given up and left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for My sake and for the Gospel’s
41010030	Who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time -- houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions -- and in the age to come , eternal life .
41010031	But many [ who are now ] first will be last [ then ] , and many [ who are now ] last will be first [ then ] .
41010032	They were on the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking on in front of them ; and they were bewildered and perplexed and greatly astonished , and those [ who were still ] following were seized with alarm and were afraid . And He took the Twelve [ apostles ] again and began to tell them what was about to happen to Him ,
41010033	[ Saying ] , Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes ; and they will condemn and sentence Him to death and turn Him over to the Gentiles .
41010034	And they will mock Him and spit on Him , and whip Him and put Him to death ; but after three days He will rise again [ from death ] .
41010035	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , approached Him and said to Him , Teacher , we desire You to do for us whatever we ask of You .
41010036	And He replied to them , What do you desire Me to do for you ?
41010037	And they said to Him , Grant that we may sit , one at Your right hand and one at [ Your ] left hand , in Your glory ( Your majesty and splendor ) .
41010038	But Jesus said to them , You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism [ of affliction ] with which I am baptized ?
41010039	And they replied to Him , We are able . And Jesus told them , The cup that I drink you will drink , and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ,
41010040	But to sit at My right hand or at My left hand is not Mine to give ; but [ it will be given to those ] for whom it is ordained and prepared .
41010041	And when the other ten [ apostles ] heard it , they began to be indignant with James and John .
41010042	But Jesus called them to [ Him ] and said to them , You know that those who are recognized as governing and are supposed to rule the Gentiles ( the nations ) lord it over them [ ruling with absolute power , holding them in subjection ] , and their great men exercise authority and dominion over them .
41010043	But this is not to be so among you ; instead , whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant ,
41010044	And whoever wishes to be most important and first in rank among you must be slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man came not to have service rendered to Him , but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for ( instead of ) many .
41010046	Then they came to Jericho . And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a great crowd , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , a son of Timaeus , was sitting by the roadside .
41010047	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout , saying , Jesus , Son of David , have pity and mercy on me [ now ] !
41010048	And many severely censured and reproved him , telling him to keep still , but he kept on shouting out all the more , You Son of David , have pity and mercy on me [ now ] !
41010049	And Jesus stopped and said , Call him . And they called the blind man , telling him , Take courage ! Get up ! He is calling you .
41010050	And throwing off his outer garment , he leaped up and came to Jesus .
41010051	And Jesus said to him , What do you want Me to do for you ? And the blind man said to Him , Master , let me receive my sight .
41010052	And Jesus said to him , Go your way ; your faith has healed you . And at once he received his sight and accompanied Jesus on the road .
41011001	WHEN THEY were getting near to Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives , He sent ahead two of His disciples
41011002	And instructed them , Go into the village in front of you , and as soon as you enter it , you will find a colt tied , which has never been ridden by anyone ; unfasten it and bring it [ here ] .
41011003	If anyone asks you , Why are you doing this ? answer , The Lord needs it , and He will send it back here presently .
41011004	So they went away and found a colt tied at the door out in the [ winding ] open street , and they loosed it .
41011005	And some who were standing there said to them , What are you doing , untying the colt ?
41011006	And they replied as Jesus had directed them , and they allowed them to go .
41011007	And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their outer garments upon it , and He sat on it .
41011008	And many [ of the people ] spread their garments on the road , and others [ scattered a layer of ] leafy branches which they had cut from the fields .
41011009	And those who went before and those who followed cried out [ with a cry of happiness ] , Hosanna ! [ Be graciously inclined and propitious to Him ! ] Praised and blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	Praised and blessed in the name of the Lord is the coming kingdom of our father David ! Hosanna ( O save us ) in the highest [ heaven ] !
41011011	And Jesus went into Jerusalem and entered the temple [ enclosure ] ; and when He had looked around , surveying and observing everything , as it was already late , He went out to Bethany together with the Twelve [ apostles ] .
41011012	On the day following , when they had come away from Bethany , He was hungry .
41011013	And seeing in the distance a fig tree [ covered ] with leaves , He went to see if He could find any [ fruit ] on it [ for in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves ] . But when He came up to it , He found nothing but leaves , for the fig season had not yet come .
41011014	And He said to it , No one ever again shall eat fruit from you . And His disciples were listening [ to what He said ] .
41011015	And they came to Jerusalem . And He went into the temple [ area , the porches and courts ] and began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple area , and He overturned the [ four-footed ] tables of the money changers and the seats of those who dealt in doves ;
41011016	And He would not permit anyone to carry any household equipment through the temple enclosure [ thus making the temple area a short-cut traffic lane ] .
41011017	And He taught and said to them , Is it not written , My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? But you have turned it into a den of robbers .
41011018	And the chief priests and the scribes heard [ of this ] and kept seeking some way to destroy Him , for they feared Him , because the entire multitude was struck with astonishment at His teaching .
41011019	And when evening came on , He and His disciples , as accustomed , went out of the city .
41011020	In the morning , when they were passing along , they noticed that the fig tree was withered [ completely ] away to its roots .
41011021	And Peter remembered and said to Him , Master , look ! The fig tree which You doomed has withered away !
41011022	And Jesus , replying , said to them , Have faith in God [ constantly ] .
41011023	Truly I tell you , whoever says to this mountain , Be lifted up and thrown into the sea ! and does not doubt at all in his heart but believes that what he says will take place , it will be done for him .
41011024	For this reason I am telling you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe ( trust and be confident ) that it is granted to you , and you will [ get it ] .
41011025	And whenever you stand praying , if you have anything against anyone , forgive him and let it drop ( leave it , let it go ) , in order that your Father Who is in heaven may also forgive you your [ own ] failings and shortcomings and let them drop .
41011026	But if you do not forgive , neither will your Father in heaven forgive your failings and shortcomings .
41011027	And they came again to Jerusalem . And when Jesus was walking about in the [ courts and porches of the ] temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him ,
41011028	And they kept saying to Him , By what [ sort of ] authority are You doing these things , or who gave You this authority to do them ?
41011029	Jesus told them , I will ask you a question . Answer Me , and then I will tell you by what [ sort of ] authority I do these things .
41011030	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men ? Answer Me .
41011031	And they reasoned and argued with one another , If we say , From heaven , He will say , Why then did you not believe him ?
41011032	But [ on the other hand ] can we say , From men ? For they were afraid of the people , because everybody considered and held John actually to be a prophet .
41011033	So they replied to Jesus , We do not know . And Jesus said to them , Neither am I going to tell you what [ sort of ] authority I have for doing these things .
41012001	AND [ Jesus ] started to speak to them in parables [ with comparisons and illustrations ] . A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower and let it out [ for rent ] to vinedressers and went into another country .
41012002	When the season came , he sent a bond servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
41012003	But they took him and beat him and sent him away without anything .
41012004	Again he sent to them another bond servant , and they stoned him and wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully [ sending him away with insults ] .
41012005	And he sent another , and that one they killed ; then many others -- some they beat , and some they put to death .
41012006	He had still one left [ to send ] , a beloved son ; last of all he sent him to them , saying , They will respect my son .
41012007	But those tenants said to one another , Here is the heir ; come on , let us put him to death , and [ then ] the inheritance will be ours .
41012008	And they took him and killed him , and threw [ his body ] outside the vineyard .
41012009	Now what will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the tenants , and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Have you not even read this [ passage of ] Scripture : The very Stone which [ after putting It to the test ] the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner [ Cornerstone ] ;
41012011	This is from the Lord and is His doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ?
41012012	And they were trying to get hold of Him , but they were afraid of the people , for they knew that He spoke this parable with reference to and against them . So they left Him and departed .
41012013	But they sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him for the purpose of entrapping Him in His speech .
41012014	And they came up and said to Him , Teacher , we know that You are sincere and what You profess to be , that You cannot lie , and that You have no personal bias for anyone ; for You are not influenced by partiality and have no regard for anyone’s external condition or position , but in [ and on the basis of ] truth You teach the way of God . Is it lawful ( permissible and right ) to give tribute ( poll taxes ) to Caesar or not ?
41012015	Should we pay [ them ] or should we not pay [ them ] ? But knowing their hypocrisy , He asked them , Why do you put Me to the test ? Bring Me a coin ( a denarius ) , so I may see it .
41012016	And they brought [ Him one ] . Then He asked them , Whose image ( picture ) is this ? And whose superscription ( title ) ? They said to Him , Caesar’s .
41012017	Jesus said to them , Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s . And they stood marveling and greatly amazed at Him .
41012018	And [ some ] Sadducees came to Him , [ of that party ] who say there is no resurrection , and they asked Him a question , saying ,
41012019	Teacher , Moses gave us [ a law ] that if a man’s brother died , leaving a wife but no child , the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
41012020	Now there were seven brothers ; the first one took a wife and died , leaving no children .
41012021	And the second [ brother ] married her , and died , leaving no children ; and the third did the same ;
41012022	And all seven , leaving no children . Last of all , the woman died also .
41012023	Now in the resurrection , whose wife will she be ? For the seven were married to her .
41012024	Jesus said to them , Is not this where you wander out of the way and go wrong , because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God ?
41012025	For when they arise from among the dead , [ men ] do not marry nor are [ women ] given in marriage , but are like the angels in heaven .
41012026	But concerning the dead being raised -- have you not read in the book of Moses , [ in the passage ] about the [ burning ] bush , how God said to him , I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ?
41012027	He is not the God of [ the ] dead , but of [ the ] living ! You are very wrong .
41012028	Then one of the scribes came up and listened to them disputing with one another , and , noticing that Jesus answered them fitly and admirably , he asked Him , Which commandment is first and most important of all [ in its nature ] ?
41012029	Jesus answered , The first and principal one of all commands is : Hear , O Israel , The Lord our God is one Lord ;
41012030	And you shall love the Lord your God out of and with your whole heart and out of and with all your soul ( your life ) and out of and with all your mind ( with your faculty of thought and your moral understanding ) and out of and with all your strength . This is the first and principal commandment .
41012031	The second is like it and is this , You shall love your neighbor as yourself . There is no other commandment greater than these .
41012032	And the scribe said to Him , Excellently and fitly and admirably answered , Teacher ! You have said truly that He is One , and there is no other but Him ;
41012033	And to love Him out of and with all the heart and with all the understanding [ with the faculty of quick apprehension and intelligence and keenness of discernment ] and with all the strength , and to love one’s neighbor as oneself , is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
41012034	And when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently ( discreetly and having his wits about him ) , He said to him , You are not far from the kingdom of God . And after that no one ventured or dared to ask Him any further question .
41012035	And as Jesus taught in [ a porch or court of ] the temple , He said , How can the scribes say that the Christ is David’s Son ?
41012036	David himself , [ inspired ] in the Holy Spirit , declared , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies [ a footstool ] under Your feet .
41012037	David himself calls Him Lord ; so how can it be that He is his Son ? Now the great mass of the people heard [ Jesus ] gladly [ listening to Him with delight ] .
41012038	And in [ the course of ] His teaching , He said , Beware of the scribes , who like to go around in long robes and [ to get ] greetings in the marketplaces [ public forums ] ,
41012039	And [ have ] the front seats in the synagogues and the chief couches ( places of honor ) at feasts ,
41012040	Who devour widows’ houses and to cover it up make long prayers . They will receive the heavier [ sentence of ] condemnation .
41012041	And He sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury . Many rich [ people ] were throwing in large sums .
41012042	And a widow who was poverty-stricken came and put in two copper mites [ the smallest of coins ] , which together make half of a cent .
41012043	And He called His disciples [ to Him ] and said to them , Truly and surely I tell you , this widow , [ she who is ] poverty-stricken , has put in more than all those contributing to the treasury .
41012044	For they all threw in out of their abundance ; but she , out of her deep poverty , has put in everything that she had -- [ even ] all she had on which to live .
41013001	AND AS [ Jesus ] was coming out of the temple [ area ] , one of His disciples said to Him , Look , Teacher ! Notice the sort and quality of these stones and buildings !
41013002	And Jesus replied to him , You see these great buildings ? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be loosened and torn down .
41013003	And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple [ enclosure ] , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately ,
41013004	Tell us when is this to take place and what will be the sign when these things , all [ of them ] , are about to be accomplished ?
41013005	And Jesus began to tell them , Be careful and watchful that no one misleads you [ about it ] .
41013006	Many will come in [ appropriating to themselves ] the name [ of Messiah ] which belongs to Me [ basing their claims on the use of My name ] , saying , I am [ He ] ! And they will mislead many .
41013007	And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not get alarmed ( troubled and frightened ) ; it is necessary [ that these things ] take place , but the end is not yet .
41013008	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places ; there will be famines and calamities . This is but the beginning of the intolerable anguish and suffering [ only the first of the birth pangs ] .
41013009	But look to yourselves ; for they will turn you over to councils , and you will be beaten in the synagogues , and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake as a testimony to them .
41013010	And the good news ( the Gospel ) must first be preached to all nations .
41013011	Now when they take you [ to court ] and put you under arrest , do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say nor [ even ] meditate about it ; but say whatever is given you in that hour and at the moment , for it is not you who will be speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	And brother will hand over brother to death , and the father his child ; and children will take a stand against their parents and [ have ] them put to death .
41013013	And you will be hated and detested by everybody for My name’s sake , but he who patiently perseveres and endures to the end will be saved ( made a partaker of the salvation by Christ , and delivered from spiritual death ) .
41013014	But when you see the abomination of desolation mentioned by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not to be -- [ and ] let the one who reads take notice and consider and understand and heed [ this ] -- then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
41013015	Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house nor go inside to take anything out of his house ;
41013016	And let him who is in the field not turn back again to get his mantle ( cloak ) .
41013017	And alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days !
41013018	Pray that it may not occur in winter ,
41013019	For at that time there will be such affliction ( oppression and tribulation ) as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until this particular time -- and positively never will be [ again ] .
41013020	And unless the Lord had shortened the days , no human being would be saved ( rescued ) ; but for the sake of the elect , His chosen ones ( those whom He picked out for Himself ) , He has shortened the days .
41013021	And then if anyone says to you , See , here is the Christ ( the Messiah ) ! or , Look , there He is ! do not believe it .
41013022	False Christs ( Messiahs ) and false prophets will arise and show signs and [ work ] miracles to deceive and lead astray , if possible , even the elect ( those God has chosen out for Himself ) .
41013023	But look to yourselves and be on your guard ; I have told you everything beforehand .
41013024	But in those days , after [ the affliction and oppression and distress of ] that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ;
41013025	And the stars will be falling from the sky , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken .
41013026	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great ( kingly ) power and glory ( majesty and splendor ) .
41013027	And then He will send out the angels and will gather together His elect ( those He has picked out for Himself ) from the four winds , from the farthest bounds of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven .
41013028	Now learn a lesson from the fig tree : as soon as its branch becomes tender and it puts forth its leaves , you recognize and know that summer is near .
41013029	So also , when you see these things happening , you may recognize and know that He is near , at [ the very ] door .
41013030	Surely I say to you , this generation ( the whole multitude of people living at that one time ) positively will not perish or pass away before all these things take place .
41013031	Heaven and earth will perish and pass away , but My words will not perish or pass away .
41013032	But of that day or that hour not a [ single ] person knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
41013033	Be on your guard [ constantly alert ] , and watch and pray ; for you do not know when the time will come .
41013034	It is like a man [ already ] going on a journey ; when he leaves home , he puts his servants in charge , each with his particular task , and he gives orders to the doorkeeper to be constantly alert and on the watch .
41013035	Therefore watch ( give strict attention , be cautious and alert ) , for you do not know when the Master of the house is coming -- in the evening , or at midnight , or at cockcrowing , or in the morning --
41013036	[ Watch , I say ] lest He come suddenly and unexpectedly and find you asleep .
41013037	And what I say to you I say to everybody : Watch ( give strict attention , be cautious , active , and alert ) !
41014001	IT WAS now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread , and the chief priests and the scribes were all the while seeking to arrest [ Jesus ] by secrecy and deceit and put [ Him ] to death ,
41014002	For they kept saying , It must not be during the Feast , for fear that there might be a riot of the people .
41014003	And while He was in Bethany , [ a guest ] in the house of Simon the leper , as He was reclining [ at table ] , a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment ( perfume ) of pure nard , very costly and precious ; and she broke the jar and poured [ the perfume ] over His head .
41014004	But there were some who were moved with indignation and said to themselves , To what purpose was the ointment ( perfume ) thus wasted ?
41014005	For it was possible to have sold this [ perfume ] for more than 300 denarii [ a laboring man’s wages for a year ] and to have given [ the money ] to the poor . And they censured and reproved her .
41014006	But Jesus said , Let her alone ; why are you troubling her ? She has done a good and beautiful thing to Me [ praiseworthy and noble ] .
41014007	For you always have the poor with you , and whenever you wish you can do good to them ; but you will not always have Me .
41014008	She has done what she could ; she came beforehand to anoint My body for the burial .
41014009	And surely I tell you , wherever the good news ( the Gospel ) is proclaimed in the entire world , what she has done will be told in memory of her .
41014010	Then Judas Iscariot , who was one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , went off to the chief priests in order to betray and hand Him over to them .
41014011	And when they heard it , they rejoiced and were delighted , and they promised to give him money . And he [ busying himself continually ] sought an opportunity to betray Him .
41014012	On the first day [ of the Feast ] of Unleavened Bread , when [ as was customary ] they killed the Passover lamb , [ Jesus’ ] disciples said to Him , Where do You wish us to go [ and ] prepare the Passover [ supper ] for You to eat ?
41014013	And He sent two of His disciples and said to them , Go into the city , and a man carrying an [ earthen ] jar or pitcher of water will meet you ; follow him .
41014014	And whatever [ house ] he enters , say to the master of the house , The Teacher says : Where is My guest room , where I may eat the Passover [ supper ] with My disciples ?
41014015	And he will [ himself ] show you a large upper room , furnished [ with carpets and with dining couches properly spread ] and ready ; there prepare for us .
41014016	Then the disciples set out and came to the city and found [ everything ] just as He had told them ; and they prepared the Passover .
41014017	And when it was evening , He came with the Twelve [ apostles ] .
41014018	And while they were at the table eating , Jesus said , Surely I say to you , one of you will betray Me , [ one ] who is eating [ here ] with Me .
41014019	And they began to show that they were sad and hurt , and to say to Him one after another , Is it I ? or , It is not I , is it ?
41014020	He replied to them , It is one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , one who is dipping [ bread ] into the [ same deep ] dish with Me .
41014021	For the Son of Man is going as it stands written concerning Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been good ( profitable and wholesome ) for that man if he had never been born .
41014022	And while they were eating , He took a loaf [ of bread ] , praised God and gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use . [ Then ] He broke [ it ] and gave to them and said , Take . Eat . This is My body .
41014023	He also took a cup [ of the juice of grapes ] , and when He had given thanks , He gave [ it ] to them , and they all drank of it .
41014024	And He said to them , This is My blood [ which ratifies ] the new covenant , [ the blood ] which is being poured out for ( on account of ) many .
41014025	Solemnly and surely I tell you , I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it of a new and a higher quality in God’s kingdom .
41014026	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	And Jesus said to them , You will all fall away this night [ that is , you will be caused to stumble and will begin to distrust and desert Me ] , for it stands written , I will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered .
41014028	But after I am raised [ to life ] , I will go before you into Galilee .
41014029	But Peter said to Him , Even if they all fall away and are caused to stumble and distrust and desert You , yet I will not [ do so ] !
41014030	And Jesus said to him , Truly I tell you , this very night , before a cock crows twice , you will utterly deny Me [ disclaiming all connection with Me ] three times .
41014031	But [ Peter ] said more vehemently and repeatedly , [ Even ] if it should be necessary for me to die with You , I will not deny or disown You ! And they all kept saying the same thing .
41014032	Then they went to a place called Gethsemane , and He said to His disciples , Sit down here while I pray .
41014033	And He took with Him Peter and James and John , and began to be struck with terror and amazement and deeply troubled and depressed .
41014034	And He said to them , My soul is exceedingly sad ( overwhelmed with grief ) so that it almost kills Me ! Remain here and keep awake and be watching .
41014035	And going a little farther , He fell on the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the [ fatal ] hour might pass from Him .
41014036	And He was saying , Abba , [ which means ] Father , everything is possible for You . Take away this cup from Me ; yet not what I will , but what You [ will ] .
41014037	And He came back and found them sleeping , and He said to Peter , Simon , are you asleep ? Have you not the strength to keep awake and watch [ with Me for ] one hour ?
41014038	Keep awake and watch and pray [ constantly ] , that you may not enter into temptation ; the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
41014039	He went away again and prayed , saying the same words .
41014040	And again He came back and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy ; and they did not know what answer to give Him .
41014041	And He came back a third time and said to them , Are you still sleeping and resting ? It is enough [ of that ] ! The hour has come . The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinful men ( men whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God ) .
41014042	Get up , let us be going ! See , My betrayer is at hand !
41014043	And at once , while He was still speaking , Judas came , one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , and with him a crowd of men with swords and clubs , [ who came ] from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders [ of the Sanhedrin ] .
41014044	Now the betrayer had given them a signal , saying , The One I shall kiss is [ the Man ] ; seize Him and lead [ Him ] away safely [ so as to prevent His escape ] .
41014045	And when he came , he went up to Jesus immediately and said , Master ! Master ! and he embraced Him and kissed Him fervently .
41014046	And they threw their hands on Him and arrested Him .
41014047	But one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
41014048	And Jesus said to them , Have you come out with swords and clubs as [ you would ] against a robber to capture Me ?
41014049	I was with you daily in the temple [ porches and courts ] teaching , and you did not seize Me ; but [ this has happened ] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled .
41014050	Then [ His disciples ] , forsaking Him , fled , all [ of them ] .
41014051	And a young man was following Him , with nothing but a linen cloth ( sheet ) thrown about [ his ] naked [ body ] ; and they laid hold of him ,
41014052	But , leaving behind the linen cloth ( sheet ) , he fled from them naked .
41014053	And they led Jesus away to the high priest , and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were gathered together .
41014054	And Peter followed Him at a distance , even right into the courtyard of the high priest . And he was sitting [ in the firelight ] with the guards and warming himself at the fire .
41014055	Now the chief priests and the entire council ( the Sanhedrin ) were constantly seeking [ to get ] testimony against Jesus with a view to condemning Him and putting Him to death , but they did not find any .
41014056	For many were repeatedly bearing false witness against Him , but their testimonies did not agree .
41014057	And some stood up and were bearing false witness against Him , saying ,
41014058	We heard Him say , I will destroy this temple ( sanctuary ) which is made with hands , and in three days I will build another , made without hands .
41014059	Still not even [ in this ] did their testimony agree .
41014060	And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus , Have You not even one answer to make ? What [ about this which ] these [ men ] are testifying against You ?
41014061	But He kept still and did not answer at all . Again the high priest asked Him , Are You the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) , the Son of the Blessed ?
41014062	And Jesus said , I AM ; and you will [ all ] see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power ( the Almighty ) and coming on the clouds of heaven .
41014063	Then the high priest tore his garments and said , What need have we for more witnesses ?
41014064	You have heard His blasphemy . What is your decision ? And they all condemned Him as being guilty and deserving of death .
41014065	And some of them began to spit on Him and to blindfold Him and to strike Him with their fists , saying to Him , Prophesy ! And the guards received Him with blows and by slapping Him .
41014066	While Peter was down below in the courtyard , one of the [ serving ] maids of the high priest came ;
41014067	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she gazed intently at him and said , You were with Jesus of Nazareth too .
41014068	But he denied it falsely and disowned Him , saying , I neither know nor understand what you say . Then he went outside [ the courtyard and was ] into the vestibule . And a cock crowed .
41014069	And the maidservant saw him , and began again to say to the bystanders , This [ man ] is [ one ] of them .
41014070	But again he denied it falsely and disowned Him . And after a short while , again the bystanders said to Peter , Really , you are one of them , for you are a Galilean and your dialect shows it .
41014071	Then he commenced invoking a curse on himself [ should he not be telling the truth ] and swearing , I do not know the Man about Whom you are talking !
41014072	And at once for the second time a cock crowed . And Peter remembered how Jesus said to him , Before a cock crows twice , you will utterly deny Me [ disclaiming all connection with Me ] three times . And having put his thought upon it [ and remembering ] , he broke down and wept aloud and lamented .
41015001	AND IMMEDIATELY when it was morning , the chief priests , with the elders and scribes and the whole council , held a consultation ; and when they had bound Jesus , they took Him away [ violently ] and handed Him over to Pilate .
41015002	And Pilate inquired of Him , Are You the King of the Jews ? And He replied , It is as you say .
41015003	And the chief priests kept accusing Him of many things .
41015004	And Pilate again asked Him , Have You no answer to make ? See how many charges they are bringing against You !
41015005	But Jesus made no further answer at all , so that Pilate wondered and marveled .
41015006	Now at the Feast he [ was accustomed to ] set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested .
41015007	And among the rioters in the prison who had committed murder in the insurrection there was a man named Barabbas .
41015008	And the throng came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them .
41015009	And he replied to them , Do you wish me to set free for you the King of the Jews ?
41015010	For he was aware that it was [ because they were prompted ] by envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release for them Barabbas instead .
41015012	And again Pilate said to them , Then what shall I do with the Man Whom you call the King of the Jews ?
41015013	And they shouted back again , Crucify Him !
41015014	But Pilate said to them , Why ? What has He done that is evil ? But they shouted with all their might all the more , Crucify Him [ at once ] !
41015015	So Pilate , wishing to satisfy the crowd , set Barabbas free for them ; and after having Jesus whipped , he handed [ Him ] over to be crucified .
41015016	Then the soldiers led Him away to the courtyard inside the palace , that is , the Praetorium , and they called the entire detachment of soldiers together .
41015017	And they dressed Him in [ a ] purple [ robe ] , and , weaving together a crown of thorns , they placed it on Him .
41015018	And they began to salute Him , Hail ( greetings , good health to You , long life to You ) , King of the Jews !
41015019	And they struck His head with a staff made of a [ bamboo-like ] reed and spat on Him and kept bowing their knees in homage to Him .
41015020	And when they had [ finished ] making sport of Him , they took the purple [ robe ] off of Him and put His own clothes on Him . And they led Him out [ of the city ] to crucify Him .
41015021	And they forced a passerby , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , who was coming in from the field ( country ) , to carry His cross .
41015022	And they led Him to Golgotha [ in Latin : Calvary ] , meaning The Place of a Skull .
41015023	And they [ attempted to ] give Him wine mingled with myrrh , but He would not take it .
41015024	And they crucified Him ; and they divided His garments and distributed them among themselves , throwing lots for them to decide who should take what .
41015025	And it was the third hour ( about nine o’clock in the morning ) when they crucified Him .
41015026	And the inscription of the accusation against Him was written above , The King of the Jews .
41015027	And with Him they crucified two robbers , one on [ His ] right hand and one on His left .
41015028	And the Scripture was fulfilled which says , He was counted among the transgressors .
41015029	And those who passed by kept reviling Him and reproaching Him abusively in harsh and insolent language , wagging their heads and saying , Aha ! You Who would destroy the temple and build it in three days ,
41015030	Now rescue Yourself [ from death ] , coming down from the cross !
41015031	So also the chief priests , with the scribes , made sport of Him to one another , saying , He rescued others [ from death ] ; Himself He is unable to rescue .
41015032	Let the Christ ( the Messiah ) , the King of Israel , come down now from the cross , that we may see [ it ] and trust in and rely on Him and adhere to Him ! Those who were crucified with Him also reviled and reproached Him [ speaking abusively , harshly , and insolently ] .
41015033	And when the sixth hour ( about midday ) had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour ( about three o’clock ) .
41015034	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? -- which means , My God , My God , why have You forsaken Me [ deserting Me and leaving Me helpless and abandoned ] ?
41015035	And some of those standing by , [ and ] hearing it , said , See ! He is calling Elijah !
41015036	And one man ran , and , filling a sponge with vinegar ( a mixture of sour wine and water ) , put it on a staff made of a [ bamboo-like ] reed and gave it to Him to drink , saying , Hold off ! Let us see whether Elijah [ does ] come to take Him down .
41015037	And Jesus uttered a loud cry , and breathed out His life .
41015038	And the curtain [ of the Holy of Holies ] of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	And when the centurion who stood facing Him saw Him expire this way , he said , Really , this Man was God’s Son !
41015040	Now some women were there also , looking on from a distance , among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses , and Salome ,
41015041	Who , when [ Jesus ] was in Galilee , were in the habit of accompanying and ministering to Him ; and [ there were ] also many other [ women ] who had come up with Him to Jerusalem .
41015042	As evening had already come , since it was the day of Preparation , that is , [ the day ] before the Sabbath ,
41015043	Joseph , he of Arimathea , noble and honorable in rank and a respected member of the council ( Sanhedrin ) , who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God , daring the consequences , took courage and ventured to go to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
41015044	But Pilate wondered whether He was dead so soon , and , having called the centurion , he asked him whether [ Jesus ] was already dead .
41015045	And when he learned from the centurion [ that He was indeed dead ] , he gave the body to Joseph .
41015046	And Joseph bought a [ fine ] linen cloth [ for swathing dead bodies ] , and , taking Him down from the cross , he rolled Him up in the [ fine ] linen cloth and placed Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock . Then he rolled a [ very large ] stone against the door of the tomb .
41015047	And Mary Magdalene and Mary [ the mother ] of Joses were [ attentively ] observing where He was laid .
41016001	AND WHEN the Sabbath was past [ that is , after the sun had set ] , Mary Magdalene , and Mary [ the mother ] of James , and Salome purchased sweet-smelling spices , so that they might go and anoint [ Jesus’ body ] .
41016002	And very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb ; [ by then ] the sun had risen .
41016003	And they said to one another , Who will roll back the stone for us out of [ the groove across the floor at ] the door of the tomb ?
41016004	And when they looked up , they [ distinctly ] saw that the stone was already rolled back , for it was very large .
41016005	And going into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting [ there ] on the right [ side ] , clothed in a [ long , stately , sweeping ] robe of white , and they were utterly amazed and struck with terror .
41016006	And he said to them , Do not be amazed and terrified ; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth , Who was crucified . He has risen ; He is not here . See the place where they laid Him .
41016007	But be going ; tell the disciples and Peter , He goes before you into Galilee ; you will see Him there , [ just ] as He told you .
41016008	Then they went out [ and ] fled from the tomb , for trembling and bewilderment and consternation had seized them . And they said nothing about it to anyone , for they were held by alarm and fear .
41016009	Now Jesus , having risen [ from death ] early on the first day of the week , appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom He had driven out seven demons .
41016010	She went and reported it to those who had been with Him , as they grieved and wept .
41016011	And when they heard that He was alive and that she had seen Him , they did not believe it .
41016012	After this , He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking [ along the way ] into the country .
41016013	And they returned [ to Jerusalem ] and told the others , but they did not believe them either .
41016014	Afterward He appeared to the Eleven [ apostles themselves ] as they reclined at table ; and He reproved and reproached them for their unbelief ( their lack of faith ) and their hardness of heart , because they had refused to believe those who had seen Him and looked at Him attentively after He had risen [ from death ] .
41016015	And He said to them , Go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news ( the Gospel ) to every creature [ of the whole human race ] .
41016016	He who believes [ who adheres to and trusts in and relies on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth ] and is baptized will be saved [ from the penalty of eternal death ] ; but he who does not believe [ who does not adhere to and trust in and rely on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth ] will be condemned .
41016017	And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe : in My name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new languages ;
41016018	They will pick up serpents ; and [ even ] if they drink anything deadly , it will not hurt them ; they will lay their hands on the sick , and they will get well .
41016019	So then the Lord Jesus , after He had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven and He sat down at the right hand of God .
41016020	And they went out and preached everywhere , while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the attesting signs and miracles that closely accompanied [ it ] . Amen ( so be it ) .
42001001	SINCE [ as is well known ] many have undertaken to put in order and draw up a [ thorough ] narrative of the surely established deeds which have been accomplished and fulfilled in and among us ,
42001002	Exactly as they were handed down to us by those who from the [ official ] beginning [ of Jesus’ ministry ] were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word [ that is , of the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] ,
42001003	It seemed good and desirable to me , [ and so I have determined ] also after having searched out diligently and followed all things closely and traced accurately the course from the highest to the minutest detail from the very first , to write an orderly account for you , most excellent Theophilus ,
42001004	[ My purpose is ] that you may know the full truth and understand with certainty and security against error the accounts ( histories ) and doctrines of the faith of which you have been informed and in which you have been orally instructed .
42001005	In the days when Herod was king of Judea there was a certain priest whose name was Zachariah , of the daily service ( the division ) of Abia ; and his wife was also a descendant of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
42001006	And they both were righteous in the sight of God , walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord .
42001007	But they had no child , for Elizabeth was barren ; and both were far advanced in years .
42001008	Now while on duty , serving as priest before God in the order of his division ,
42001009	As was the custom of the priesthood , it fell to him by lot to enter [ the sanctuary of ] the temple of the Lord and burn incense .
42001010	And all the throng of people were praying outside [ in the court ] at the hour of incense [ burning ] .
42001011	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord , standing at the right side of the altar of incense .
42001012	And when Zachariah saw him , he was troubled , and fear took possession of him .
42001013	But the angel said to him , Do not be afraid , Zachariah , because your petition was heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you must call his name John [ God is favorable ] .
42001014	And you shall have joy and exultant delight , and many will rejoice over his birth ,
42001015	For he will be great and distinguished in the sight of the Lord . And he must drink no wine nor strong drink , and he will be filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit even in and from his mother’s womb .
42001016	And he will turn back and cause to return many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God ,
42001017	And he will [ himself ] go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient and incredulous and unpersuadable to the wisdom of the upright [ which is the knowledge and holy love of the will of God ] -- in order to make ready for the Lord a people [ perfectly ] prepared [ in spirit , adjusted and disposed and placed in the right moral state ] .
42001018	And Zachariah said to the angel , By what shall I know and be sure of this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is well advanced in years .
42001019	And the angel replied to him , I am Gabriel . I stand in the [ very ] presence of God , and I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news .
42001020	Now behold , you will be and will continue to be silent and not able to speak till the day when these things take place , because you have not believed what I told you ; but my words are of a kind which will be fulfilled in the appointed and proper time .
42001021	Now the people kept waiting for Zachariah , and they wondered at his delaying [ so long ] in the sanctuary .
42001022	But when he did come out , he was unable to speak to them ; and they [ clearly ] perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary ; and he kept making signs to them , still he remained dumb .
42001023	And when his time of performing priestly functions was ended , he returned to his [ own ] house .
42001024	Now after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant , and for five months she secluded herself entirely , saying , [ I have hid myself ]
42001025	Because thus the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He deigned to look on me to take away my reproach among men .
42001026	Now in the sixth month [ after that ] , the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named Nazareth ,
42001027	To a girl never having been married and a virgin engaged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph , a descendant of the house of David ; and the virgin’s name was Mary .
42001028	And he came to her and said , Hail , O favored one [ endued with grace ] ! The Lord is with you ! Blessed ( favored of God ) are you before all other women !
42001029	But when she saw him , she was greatly troubled and disturbed and confused at what he said and kept revolving in her mind what such a greeting might mean .
42001030	And the angel said to her , Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found grace ( free , spontaneous , absolute favor and loving-kindness ) with God .
42001031	And listen ! You will become pregnant and will give birth to a Son , and you shall call His name Jesus .
42001032	He will be great ( eminent ) and will be called the Son of the Most High ; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His forefather David ,
42001033	And He will reign over the house of Jacob throughout the ages ; and of His reign there will be no end .
42001034	And Mary said to the angel , How can this be , since I have no [ intimacy with any man as a ] husband ?
42001035	Then the angel said to her , The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you [ like a shining cloud ] ; and so the holy ( pure , sinless ) Thing ( Offspring ) which shall be born of you will be called the Son of God .
42001036	And listen ! Your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son , and this is now the sixth month with her who was called barren .
42001037	For with God nothing is ever impossible and no word from God shall be without power or impossible of fulfillment .
42001038	Then Mary said , Behold , I am the handmaiden of the Lord ; let it be done to me according to what you have said . And the angel left her .
42001039	And at that time Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country to a town of Judah ,
42001040	And she went to the house of Zachariah and , entering it , saluted Elizabeth .
42001041	And it occurred that when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit .
42001042	And she cried out with a loud cry , and then exclaimed , Blessed ( favored of God ) above all other women are you ! And blessed ( favored of God ) is the Fruit of your womb !
42001043	And how [ have I deserved that this honor should ] be granted to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
42001044	For behold , the instant the sound of your salutation reached my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy .
42001045	And blessed ( happy , to be envied ) is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from the Lord .
42001046	And Mary said , My soul magnifies and extols the Lord ,
42001047	And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior ,
42001048	For He has looked upon the low station and humiliation of His handmaiden . For behold , from now on all generations [ of all ages ] will call me blessed and declare me happy and to be envied !
42001049	For He Who is almighty has done great things for me -- and holy is His name [ to be venerated in His purity , majesty and glory ] !
42001050	And His mercy ( His compassion and kindness toward the miserable and afflicted ) is on those who fear Him with godly reverence , from generation to generation and age to age .
42001051	He has shown strength and made might with His arm ; He has scattered the proud and haughty in and by the imagination and purpose and designs of their hearts .
42001052	He has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree .
42001053	He has filled and satisfied the hungry with good things , and the rich He has sent away empty-handed [ without a gift ] .
42001054	He has laid hold on His servant Israel [ to help him , to espouse his cause ] , in remembrance of His mercy ,
42001055	Even as He promised to our forefathers , to Abraham and to his descendants forever .
42001056	And Mary remained with her [ Elizabeth ] for about three months and [ then ] returned to her [ own ] home .
42001057	Now the time that Elizabeth should be delivered came , and she gave birth to a son .
42001058	And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy on her , and they rejoiced with her .
42001059	And it occurred that on the eighth day , when they came to circumcise the child , they were intending to call him Zachariah after his father ,
42001060	But his mother answered , Not so ! But he shall be called John .
42001061	And they said to her , None of your relatives is called by that name .
42001062	And they inquired with signs to his father [ as to ] what he wanted to have him called .
42001063	Then Zachariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote , His name is John . And they were all astonished .
42001064	And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he began to speak , blessing and praising and thanking God .
42001065	And awe and reverential fear came on all their neighbors ; and all these things were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea .
42001066	And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , Whatever will this little boy be then ? For the hand of the Lord was [ so evidently ] with him [ protecting and aiding him ] .
42001067	Now Zachariah his father was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit and prophesied , saying ,
42001068	Blessed ( praised and extolled and thanked ) be the Lord , the God of Israel , because He has come and brought deliverance and redemption to His people !
42001069	And He has raised up a Horn of salvation [ a mighty and valiant Helper , the Author of salvation ] for us in the house of David His servant --
42001070	This is as He promised by the mouth of His holy prophets from the most ancient times [ in the memory of man ] --
42001071	That we should have deliverance and be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who detest and pursue us with hatred ;
42001072	To make true and show the mercy and compassion and kindness [ promised ] to our forefathers and to remember and carry out His holy covenant [ to bless , which is all the more sacred because it is made by God Himself ] ,
42001073	That covenant He sealed by oath to our forefather Abraham :
42001074	To grant us that we , being delivered from the hand of our foes , might serve Him fearlessly
42001075	In holiness ( divine consecration ) and righteousness [ in accordance with the everlasting principles of right ] within His presence all the days of our lives .
42001076	And you , little one , shall be called a prophet of the Most High ; for you shall go on before the face of the Lord to make ready His ways ,
42001077	To bring and give the knowledge of salvation to His people in the forgiveness and remission of their sins .
42001078	Because of and through the heart of tender mercy and loving-kindness of our God , a Light from on high will dawn upon us and visit [ us ]
42001079	To shine upon and give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to direct and guide our feet in a straight line into the way of peace .
42001080	And the little boy grew and became strong in spirit ; and he was in the deserts ( wilderness ) until the day of his appearing to Israel [ the commencement of his public ministry ] .
42002001	IN THOSE days it occurred that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole Roman empire should be registered .
42002002	This was the first enrollment , and it was made when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	And all the people were going to be registered , each to his own city or town .
42002004	And Joseph also went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea , to the town of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ,
42002005	To be enrolled with Mary , his espoused ( married ) wife , who was about to become a mother .
42002006	And while they were there , the time came for her delivery ,
42002007	And she gave birth to her Son , her Firstborn ; and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger , because there was no room or place for them in the inn .
42002008	And in that vicinity there were shepherds living [ out under the open sky ] in the field , watching [ in shifts ] over their flock by night .
42002009	And behold , an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord flashed and shone all about them , and they were terribly frightened .
42002010	But the angel said to them , Do not be afraid ; for behold , I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people .
42002011	For to you is born this day in the town of David a Savior , Who is Christ ( the Messiah ) the Lord !
42002012	And this will be a sign for you [ by which you will recognize Him ] : you will find [ after searching ] a Baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger .
42002013	Then suddenly there appeared with the angel an army of the troops of heaven ( a heavenly knighthood ) , praising God and saying ,
42002014	Glory to God in the highest [ heaven ] , and on earth peace among men with whom He is well pleased [ men of goodwill , of His favor ] .
42002015	When the angels went away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing ( saying ) that has come to pass , which the Lord has made known to us .
42002016	So they went with haste and [ by searching ] found Mary and Joseph , and the Baby lying in a manger .
42002017	And when they saw it , they made known what had been told them concerning this Child ,
42002018	And all who heard it were astounded and marveled at what the shepherds told them .
42002019	But Mary was keeping within herself all these things ( sayings ) , weighing and pondering them in her heart .
42002020	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen , just as it had been told them .
42002021	And at the end of eight days , when [ the Baby ] was to be circumcised , He was called Jesus , the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb .
42002022	And when the time for their purification [ the mother’s purification and the Baby’s dedication ] came according to the Law of Moses , they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord --
42002023	As it is written in the Law of the Lord , Every [ firstborn ] male that opens the womb shall be set apart and dedicated and called holy to the Lord --
42002024	And [ they came also ] to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord : a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons .
42002025	Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon , and this man was righteous and devout [ cautiously and carefully observing the divine Law ] , and looking for the Consolation of Israel ; and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
42002026	And it had been divinely revealed ( communicated ) to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
42002027	And prompted by the [ Holy ] Spirit , he came into the temple [ enclosure ] ; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus to do for Him what was customary according to the Law ,
42002028	[ Simeon ] took Him up in his arms and praised and thanked God and said ,
42002029	And now , Lord , You are releasing Your servant to depart ( leave this world ) in peace , according to Your word .
42002030	For with my [ own ] eyes I have seen Your Salvation ,
42002031	Which You have ordained and prepared before ( in the presence of ) all peoples ,
42002032	A Light for revelation to the Gentiles [ to disclose what was before unknown ] and [ to bring ] praise and honor and glory to Your people Israel .
42002033	And His [ legal ] father and [ His ] mother were marveling at what was said about Him .
42002034	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother , Behold , this Child is appointed and destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel , and for a sign that is spoken against --
42002035	And a sword will pierce through your own soul also -- that the secret thoughts and purposes of many hearts may be brought out and disclosed .
42002036	And there was also a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was very old , having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood ,
42002037	And as a widow even for eighty-four years . She did not go out from the temple enclosure , but was worshiping night and day with fasting and prayer .
42002038	And she too came up at that same hour , and she returned thanks to God and talked of [ Jesus ] to all who were looking for the redemption ( deliverance ) of Jerusalem .
42002039	And when they had done everything according to the Law of the Lord , they went back into Galilee to their own town , Nazareth .
42002040	And the Child grew and became strong in spirit , filled with wisdom ; and the grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) of God was upon Him .
42002041	Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year to the Passover Feast .
42002042	And when He was twelve years [ old ] , they went up , as was their custom .
42002043	And when the Feast was ended , as they were returning , the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem . Now His parents did not know this ,
42002044	But , supposing Him to be in the caravan , they traveled on a day’s journey ; and [ then ] they sought Him [ diligently , looking up and down for Him ] among their kinsfolk and acquaintances .
42002045	And when they failed to find Him , they went back to Jerusalem , looking for Him [ up and down ] all the way .
42002046	After three days they found Him [ came upon Him ] in the [ court of the ] temple , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
42002047	And all who heard Him were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His intelligence and understanding and His replies .
42002048	And when they [ Joseph and Mary ] saw Him , they were amazed ; and His mother said to Him , Child , why have You treated us like this ? Here Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You [ distressed and tormented ] .
42002049	And He said to them , How is it that you had to look for Me ? Did you not see and know that it is necessary [ as a duty ] for Me to be in My Father’s house and [ occupied ] about My Father’s business ?
42002050	But they did not comprehend what He was saying to them .
42002051	And He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was [ habitually ] obedient to them ; and his mother kept and closely and persistently guarded all these things in her heart .
42002052	And Jesus increased in wisdom ( in broad and full understanding ) and in stature and years , and in favor with God and man .
42003001	IN THE fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar’s reign -- when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene --
42003002	In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the Word of God [ concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] came to John son of Zachariah in the wilderness ( desert ) .
42003003	And he went into all the country round about the Jordan , preaching a baptism of repentance ( of hearty amending of their ways , with abhorrence of past wrongdoing ) unto the forgiveness of sin .
42003004	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , The voice of one crying in the wilderness [ shouting in the desert ] : Prepare the way of the Lord , make His beaten paths straight .
42003005	Every valley and ravine shall be filled up , and every mountain and hill shall be leveled ; and the crooked places shall be made straight , and the rough roads shall be made smooth ;
42003006	And all mankind shall see ( behold and understand and at last acknowledge ) the salvation of God ( the deliverance from eternal death decreed by God ) .
42003007	So he said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him , You offspring of vipers ! Who secretly warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
42003008	Bear fruits that are deserving and consistent with [ your ] repentance [ that is , conduct worthy of a heart changed , a heart abhorring sin ] . And do not begin to say to yourselves , We have Abraham as our father ; for I tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up descendants for Abraham .
42003009	Even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees , so that every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
42003010	And the multitudes asked him , Then what shall we do ?
42003011	And he replied to them , He who has two tunics ( undergarments ) , let him share with him who has none ; and he who has food , let him do it the same way .
42003012	Even tax collectors came to be baptized , and they said to him , Teacher , what shall we do ?
42003013	And he said to them , Exact and collect no more than the fixed amount appointed you .
42003014	Those serving as soldiers also asked him , And we , what shall we do ? And he replied to them , Never demand or enforce by terrifying people or by accusing wrongfully , and always be satisfied with your rations ( supplies ) and with your allowance ( wages ) .
42003015	As the people were in suspense and waiting expectantly , and everybody reasoned and questioned in their hearts concerning John , whether he perhaps might be the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
42003016	John answered them all by saying , I baptize you with water ; but He Who is mightier than I is coming , the strap of Whose sandals I am not fit to unfasten . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
42003017	His winnowing shovel ( fork ) is in His hand to thoroughly clear and cleanse His [ threshing ] floor and to gather the wheat and store it in His granary , but the chaff He will burn with fire that cannot be extinguished .
42003018	So with many other [ various ] appeals and admonitions he preached the good news ( the Gospel ) to the people .
42003019	But Herod the tetrarch , who had been [ repeatedly ] told about his fault and reproved with rebuke producing conviction by [ John ] for [ having ] Herodias , his brother’s wife , and for all the wicked things that Herod had done ,
42003020	Added this to them all -- that he shut up John in prison .
42003021	Now when all the people were baptized , and when Jesus also had been baptized , and [ while He was still ] praying , the [ visible ] heaven was opened
42003022	And the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove , and a voice came from heaven , saying , You are My Son , My Beloved ! In You I am well pleased and find delight !
42003023	Jesus Himself , when He began [ His ministry ] , was about thirty years of age , being the Son , as was supposed , of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	The son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	The son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	The son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	The son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	The son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	The son of Jesus , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	The son of Simeon , the son of Judah , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	The son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	The son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon ( Sala ) , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	The son of Aminadab , the son of Admin , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	The son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	The son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	The son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	The son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan ,
42003038	The son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	THEN JESUS , full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan and was led in [ by ] the [ Holy ] Spirit
42004002	For ( during ) forty days in the wilderness ( desert ) , where He was tempted ( tried , tested exceedingly ) by the devil . And He ate nothing during those days , and when they were completed , He was hungry .
42004003	Then the devil said to Him , If You are the Son of God , order this stone to turn into a loaf [ of bread ] .
42004004	And Jesus replied to him , It is written , Man shall not live and be sustained by ( on ) bread alone but by every word and expression of God .
42004005	Then the devil took Him up to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of time [ in the twinkling of an eye ] .
42004006	And he said to Him , To You I will give all this power and authority and their glory ( all their magnificence , excellence , preeminence , dignity , and grace ) , for it has been turned over to me , and I give it to whomever I will .
42004007	Therefore if You will do homage to and worship me [ just once ] , it shall all be Yours .
42004008	And Jesus replied to him , Get behind Me , Satan ! It is written , You shall do homage to and worship the Lord your God , and Him only shall you serve .
42004009	Then he took Him to Jerusalem and set Him on a gable of the temple , and said to Him , If You are the Son of God , cast Yourself down from here ;
42004010	For it is written , He will give His angels charge over you to guard and watch over you closely and carefully ;
42004011	And on their hands they will bear you up , lest you strike your foot against a stone .
42004012	And Jesus replied to him , [ The Scripture ] says , You shall not tempt ( try , test exceedingly ) the Lord your God .
42004013	And when the devil had ended every [ the complete cycle of ] temptation , he [ temporarily ] left Him [ that is , stood off from Him ] until another more opportune and favorable time .
42004014	Then Jesus went back full of and under the power of the [ Holy ] Spirit into Galilee , and the fame of Him spread through the whole region round about .
42004015	And He Himself conducted [ a course of ] teaching in their synagogues , being recognized and honored and praised by all .
42004016	So He came to Nazareth , [ that Nazareth ] where He had been brought up , and He entered the synagogue , as was His custom on the Sabbath day . And He stood up to read .
42004017	And there was handed to Him [ the roll of ] the book of the prophet Isaiah . He opened ( unrolled ) the book and found the place where it was written ,
42004018	The Spirit of the Lord [ is ] upon Me , because He has anointed Me [ the Anointed One , the Messiah ] to preach the good news ( the Gospel ) to the poor ; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [ who are downtrodden , bruised , crushed , and broken down by calamity ] ,
42004019	To proclaim the accepted and acceptable year of the Lord [ the day when salvation and the free favors of God profusely abound ] .
42004020	Then He rolled up the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down ; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing [ attentively ] at Him .
42004021	And He began to speak to them : Today this Scripture has been fulfilled while you are present and hearing .
42004022	And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the words of grace that came forth from His mouth ; and they said , Is not this Joseph’s Son ?
42004023	So He said to them , You will doubtless quote to Me this proverb : Physician , heal Yourself ! What we have learned by hearsay that You did in Capernaum , do here also in Your [ own ] town .
42004024	Then He said , Solemnly I say to you , no prophet is acceptable and welcome in his [ own ] town ( country ) .
42004025	But in truth I tell you , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heavens were closed up for three years and six months , so that there came a great famine over all the land ;
42004026	And yet Elijah was not sent to a single one of them , but only to Zarephath in the country of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
42004027	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and yet not one of them was cleansed [ by being healed ] -- but only Naaman the Syrian .
42004028	When they heard these things , all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage .
42004029	And rising up , they pushed and drove Him out of the town , and [ laying hold of Him ] they led Him to the [ projecting ] upper part of the hill on which their town was built , that they might hurl Him headlong down [ over the cliff ] .
42004030	But passing through their midst , He went on His way .
42004031	And He descended to Capernaum , a town of Galilee , and there He continued to teach the people on the Sabbath days .
42004032	And they were amazed at His teaching , for His word was with authority and ability and weight and power .
42004033	Now in the synagogue there was a man who was possessed by the foul spirit of a demon ; and he cried out with a loud ( deep , terrible ) cry ,
42004034	Ah , let us alone ! What have You to do with us [ What have we in common ] , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know Who You are -- the Holy One of God !
42004035	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , Be silent ( muzzled , gagged ) , and come out of him ! And when the demon had thrown the man down in their midst , he came out of him without injuring him in any possible way .
42004036	And they were all amazed and said to one another , What kind of talk is this ? For with authority and power He commands the foul spirits and they come out !
42004037	And a rumor about Him spread into every place in the surrounding country .
42004038	Then He arose and left the synagogue and went into Simon’s ( Peter’s ) house . Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering in the grip of a burning fever , and they pleaded with Him for her .
42004039	And standing over her , He rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and immediately she got up and began waiting on them .
42004040	Now at the setting of the sun [ indicating the end of the Sabbath ] , all those who had any [ who were ] sick with various diseases brought them to Him , and He laid His hands upon every one of them and cured them .
42004041	And demons even came out of many people , screaming and crying out , You are the Son of God ! But He rebuked them and would not permit them to speak , because they knew that He was the Christ ( the Messiah ) .
42004042	And when daybreak came , He left [ Peter’s house ] and went into an isolated [ desert ] place . And the people looked for Him until they came up to Him and tried to prevent Him from leaving them .
42004043	But He said to them , I must preach the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom of God to the other cities [ and towns ] also , for I was sent for this [ purpose ] .
42004044	And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee .
42005001	NOW IT occurred that while the people pressed upon Jesus to hear the message of God , He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret ( Sea of Galilee ) .
42005002	And He saw two boats drawn up by the lake , but the fishermen had gone down from them and were washing their nets .
42005003	And getting into one of the boats , [ the one ] that belonged to Simon ( Peter ) , He requested him to draw away a little from the shore . Then He sat down and continued to teach the crowd [ of people ] from the boat .
42005004	When He had stopped speaking , He said to Simon ( Peter ) , Put out into the deep [ water ] , and lower your nets for a haul .
42005005	And Simon ( Peter ) answered , Master , we toiled all night [ exhaustingly ] and caught nothing [ in our nets ] . But on the ground of Your word , I will lower the nets [ again ] .
42005006	And when they had done this , they caught a great number of fish ; and as their nets were [ at the point of ] breaking ,
42005007	They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and take hold with them . And they came and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink .
42005008	But when Simon Peter saw this , he fell down at Jesus’ knees , saying , Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
42005009	For he was gripped with bewildering amazement [ allied to terror ] , and all who were with him , at the haul of fish which they had made ;
42005010	And so also were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon ( Peter ) . And Jesus said to Simon , Have no fear ; from now on you will be catching men !
42005011	And after they had run their boats on shore , they left everything and joined Him as His disciples and sided with His party and accompanied Him .
42005012	While He was in one of the towns , there came a man full of ( covered with ) leprosy ; and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and implored Him , saying , Lord , if You are willing , You are able to cure me and make me clean .
42005013	And [ Jesus ] reached out His hand and touched him , saying , I am willing ; be cleansed ! And immediately the leprosy left him .
42005014	And [ Jesus ] charged him to tell no one [ that he might chance to meet ] , until [ He said ] you go and show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your purification , as Moses commanded , for a testimony and proof to the people , that they may have evidence [ of your healing ] .
42005015	But so much the more the news spread abroad concerning Him , and great crowds kept coming together to hear [ Him ] and to be healed by Him of their infirmities .
42005016	But He Himself withdrew [ in retirement ] to the wilderness ( desert ) and prayed .
42005017	One of those days , as He was teaching , there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by , who had come from every village and town of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem . And the power of the Lord was [ present ] with Him to heal them .
42005018	And behold , some men were bringing on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed , and they tried to carry him in and lay him before [ Jesus ] .
42005019	But finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and lowered him with his stretcher through the tiles into the midst , in front of Jesus .
42005020	And when He saw [ their confidence in Him , springing from ] their faith , He said , Man , your sins are forgiven you !
42005021	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason and question and argue , saying , Who is this [ Man ] Who speaks blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ?
42005022	But Jesus , knowing their thoughts and questionings , answered them , Why do you question in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is easier : to say , Your sins are forgiven you , or to say , Arise and walk [ about ] ?
42005024	But that you may know that the Son of Man has the [ power of ] authority and right on earth to forgive sins , He said to the paralyzed man , I say to you , arise , pick up your litter ( stretcher ) , and go to your own house !
42005025	And instantly [ the man ] stood up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went away to his house , recognizing and praising and thanking God .
42005026	And overwhelming astonishment and ecstasy seized them all , and they recognized and praised and thanked God ; and they were filled with and controlled by reverential fear and kept saying , We have seen wonderful and strange and incredible and unthinkable things today !
42005027	And after this , Jesus went out and looked [ attentively ] at a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office ; and He said to him , Join Me as a disciple and side with My party and accompany Me .
42005028	And he forsook everything and got up and followed Him [ becoming His disciple and siding with His party ] .
42005029	And Levi ( Matthew ) made a great banquet for Him in his own house , and there was a large company of tax collectors and others who were reclining [ at the table ] with them .
42005030	Now the Pharisees and their scribes were grumbling against Jesus’ disciples , saying , Why are you eating and drinking with tax collectors and [ preeminently ] sinful people ?
42005031	And Jesus replied to them , It is not those who are healthy who need a physician , but those who are sick .
42005032	I have not come to arouse and invite and call the righteous , but the erring ones ( those not free from sin ) to repentance [ to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways , with abhorrence of their past sins ] .
42005033	Then they said to Him , The disciples of John practice fasting often and offer up prayers of [ special ] petition , and so do [ the disciples ] of the Pharisees also , but Yours eat and drink .
42005034	And Jesus said to them , Can you make the wedding guests fast as long as the bridegroom is with them ?
42005035	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them ; and then they will fast in those days .
42005036	He told them a proverb also : No one puts a patch from a new garment on an old garment ; if he does , he will both tear the new one , and the patch from the new [ one ] will not match the old [ garment ] .
42005037	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins ; if he does , the fresh wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be ruined ( destroyed ) .
42005038	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .
42005039	And no one after drinking old wine immediately desires new wine , for he says , The old is good or better .
42006001	ONE SABBATH while Jesus was passing through the fields of standing grain , it occurred that His disciples picked some of the spikes and ate [ of the grain ] , rubbing it out in their hands .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees asked them , Why are you doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath days ?
42006003	And Jesus replied to them , saying , Have you never so much as read what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him ? --
42006004	How he went into the house of God and took and ate the [ sacred ] loaves of the showbread , which it is not permitted for any except only the priests to eat , and also gave to those [ who were ] with him ?
42006005	And He said to them , The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath .
42006006	And it occurred on another Sabbath that when He went into the synagogue and taught , a man was present whose right hand was withered .
42006007	And the scribes and the Pharisees kept watching Jesus to see whether He would [ actually ] heal on the Sabbath , in order that they might get [ some ground for ] accusation against Him .
42006008	But He was aware all along of their thoughts , and He said to the man with the withered hand , Come and stand here in the midst . And he arose and stood there .
42006009	Then Jesus said to them , I ask you , is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good [ so that someone derives advantage from it ] or to do evil , to save a life [ and make a soul safe ] or to destroy it ?
42006010	Then He glanced around at them all and said to the man , Stretch out your hand ! And he did so , and his hand was fully restored like the other one .
42006011	But they were filled with lack of understanding and senseless rage and discussed ( consulted ) with one another what they might do to Jesus .
42006012	Now in those days it occurred that He went up into a mountain to pray , and spent the whole night in prayer to God .
42006013	And when it was day , He summoned His disciples and selected from them twelve , whom He named apostles ( special messengers ) :
42006014	They were Simon , whom He named Peter , and his brother Andrew ; and James and John ; and Philip and Bartholomew ;
42006015	And Matthew and Thomas ; and James son of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealot ,
42006016	And Judas son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor ( a treacherous , basely faithless person ) .
42006017	And Jesus came down with them and took His stand on a level spot , with a great crowd of His disciples and a vast throng of people from all over Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to listen to Him and to be cured of their diseases --
42006018	Even those who were disturbed and troubled with unclean spirits , and they were being healed [ also ] .
42006019	And all the multitude were seeking to touch Him , for healing power was all the while going forth from Him and curing them all [ saving them from severe illnesses or calamities ] .
42006020	And solemnly lifting up His eyes on His disciples , He said : Blessed ( happy -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition -- and to be envied ) are you poor and lowly and afflicted ( destitute of wealth , influence , position , and honor ) , for the kingdom of God is yours !
42006021	Blessed ( happy -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition -- and to be envied ) are you who hunger and seek with eager desire now , for you shall be filled and completely satisfied ! Blessed ( happy -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition -- and to be envied ) are you who weep and sob now , for you shall laugh !
42006022	Blessed ( happy -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition -- and to be envied ) are you when people despise ( hate ) you , and when they exclude and excommunicate you [ as disreputable ] and revile and denounce you and defame and cast out and spurn your name as evil ( wicked ) on account of the Son of Man .
42006023	Rejoice and be glad at such a time and exult and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is rich and great and strong and intense and abundant in heaven ; for even so their forefathers treated the prophets .
42006024	But woe to ( alas for ) you who are rich ( abounding in material resources ) , for you already are receiving your consolation ( the solace and sense of strengthening and cheer that come from prosperity ) and have taken and enjoyed your comfort in full [ having nothing left to be awarded you ] .
42006025	Woe to ( alas for ) you who are full now ( completely filled , luxuriously gorged and satiated ) , for you shall hunger and suffer want ! Woe to ( alas for ) you who laugh now , for you shall mourn and weep and wail !
42006026	Woe to ( alas for ) you when everyone speaks fairly and handsomely of you and praises you , for even so their forefathers did to the false prophets .
42006027	But I say to you who are listening now to Me : [ in order to heed , make it a practice to ] love your enemies , treat well ( do good to , act nobly toward ) those who detest you and pursue you with hatred ,
42006028	Invoke blessings upon and pray for the happiness of those who curse you , implore God’s blessing ( favor ) upon those who abuse you [ who revile , reproach , disparage , and high-handedly misuse you ] .
42006029	To the one who strikes you on the jaw or cheek , offer the other jaw or cheek also ; and from him who takes away your outer garment , do not withhold your undergarment as well .
42006030	Give away to everyone who begs of you [ who is in want of necessities ] , and of him who takes away from you your goods , do not demand or require them back again .
42006031	And as you would like and desire that men would do to you , do exactly so to them .
42006032	If you [ merely ] love those who love you , what quality of credit and thanks is that to you ? For even the [ very ] sinners love their lovers ( those who love them ) .
42006033	And if you are kind and good and do favors to and benefit those who are kind and good and do favors to and benefit you , what quality of credit and thanks is that to you ? For even the preeminently sinful do the same .
42006034	And if you lend money at interest to those from whom you hope to receive , what quality of credit and thanks is that to you ? Even notorious sinners lend money at interest to sinners , so as to recover as much again .
42006035	But love your enemies and be kind and do good [ doing favors so that someone derives benefit from them ] and lend , expecting and hoping for nothing in return but considering nothing as lost and despairing of no one ; and then your recompense ( your reward ) will be great ( rich , strong , intense , and abundant ) , and you will be sons of the Most High , for He is kind and charitable and good to the ungrateful and the selfish and wicked .
42006036	So be merciful ( sympathetic , tender , responsive , and compassionate ) even as your Father is [ all these ] .
42006037	Judge not [ neither pronouncing judgment nor subjecting to censure ] , and you will not be judged ; do not condemn and pronounce guilty , and you will not be condemned and pronounced guilty ; acquit and forgive and release ( give up resentment , let it drop ) , and you will be acquitted and forgiven and released .
42006038	Give , and [ gifts ] will be given to you ; good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will they pour into [ the pouch formed by ] the bosom [ of your robe and used as a bag ] . For with the measure you deal out [ with the measure you use when you confer benefits on others ] , it will be measured back to you .
42006039	He further told them a proverb : Can a blind [ man ] guide and direct a blind [ man ] ? Will they not both stumble into a ditch or a hole in the ground ?
42006040	A pupil is not superior to his teacher , but everyone [ when he is ] completely trained ( readjusted , restored , set to rights , and perfected ) will be like his teacher .
42006041	Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye but do not notice or consider the beam [ of timber ] that is in your own eye ?
42006042	Or how can you say to your brother , Brother , allow me to take out the speck that is in your eye , when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye ? You actor ( pretender , hypocrite ) ! First take the beam out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother’s eye .
42006043	For there is no good ( healthy ) tree that bears decayed ( worthless , stale ) fruit , nor on the other hand does a decayed ( worthless , sickly ) tree bear good fruit .
42006044	For each tree is known and identified by its own fruit ; for figs are not gathered from thornbushes , nor is a cluster of grapes picked from a bramblebush .
42006045	The upright ( honorable , intrinsically good ) man out of the good treasure [ stored ] in his heart produces what is upright ( honorable and intrinsically good ) , and the evil man out of the evil storehouse brings forth that which is depraved ( wicked and intrinsically evil ) ; for out of the abundance ( overflow ) of the heart his mouth speaks .
42006046	Why do you call Me , Lord , Lord , and do not [ practice ] what I tell you ?
42006047	For everyone who comes to Me and listens to My words [ in order to heed their teaching ] and does them , I will show you what he is like :
42006048	He is like a man building a house , who dug and went down deep and laid a foundation upon the rock ; and when a flood arose , the torrent broke against that house and could not shake or move it , because it had been securely built or founded on a rock .
42006049	But he who merely hears and does not practice doing My words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation , against which the torrent burst , and immediately it collapsed and fell , and the breaking and ruin of that house was great .
42007001	AFTER JESUS had finished all that He had to say in the hearing of the people [ on the mountain ] , He entered Capernaum .
42007002	Now a centurion had a bond servant who was held in honor and highly valued by him , who was sick and at the point of death .
42007003	And when the centurion heard of Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to Him , requesting Him to come and make his bond servant well .
42007004	And when they reached Jesus , they begged Him earnestly , saying , He is worthy that You should do this for him ,
42007005	For he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue [ at his own expense ] .
42007006	And Jesus went with them . But when He was not far from the house , the centurion sent [ some ] friends to Him , saying , Lord , do not trouble [ Yourself ] , for I am not sufficiently worthy to have You come under my roof ;
42007007	Neither did I consider myself worthy to come to You . But [ just ] speak a word , and my servant boy will be healed .
42007008	For I also am a man [ daily ] subject to authority , with soldiers under me . And I say to one , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my bond servant , Do this , and he does it .
42007009	Now when Jesus heard this , He marveled at him , and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him , I tell you , not even in [ all ] Israel have I found such great faith [ as this ] .
42007010	And when the messengers who had been sent returned to the house , they found the bond servant who had been ill quite well again .
42007011	Soon afterward , Jesus went to a town called Nain , and His disciples and a great throng accompanied Him .
42007012	[ Just ] as He drew near the gate of the town , behold , a man who had died was being carried out -- the only son of his mother , and she was a widow ; and a large gathering from the town was accompanying her .
42007013	And when the Lord saw her , He had compassion on her and said to her , Do not weep .
42007014	And He went forward and touched the funeral bier , and the pallbearers stood still . And He said , Young man , I say to you , arise [ from death ] !
42007015	And the man [ who was ] dead sat up and began to speak . And [ Jesus ] gave him [ back ] to his mother .
42007016	Profound and reverent fear seized them all , and they began to recognize God and praise and give thanks , saying , A great Prophet has appeared among us ! And God has visited His people [ in order to help and care for and provide for them ] !
42007017	And this report concerning [ Jesus ] spread through the whole of Judea and all the country round about .
42007018	And John’s disciples brought him [ who was now in prison ] word of all these things .
42007019	And John summoned to him a certain two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord , saying , Are You He Who is to come , or shall we [ continue to ] look for another ?
42007020	So the men came to Jesus and said , John the Baptist sent us to You to ask , Are You the One Who is to come , or shall we [ continue to ] look for another ?
42007021	In that very hour Jesus was healing many [ people ] of sicknesses and distressing bodily plagues and evil spirits , and to many who were blind He gave [ a free , gracious , joy-giving gift of ] sight .
42007022	So He replied to them , Go and tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the good news ( the Gospel ) preached to them .
42007023	And blessed ( happy -- with life-joy and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , apart from outward conditions -- and to be envied ) is he who takes no offense in Me and who is not hurt or resentful or annoyed or repelled or made to stumble [ whatever may occur ] .
42007024	And the messengers of John having departed , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : What did you go out into the desert to gaze on ? A reed shaken and swayed by the wind ?
42007025	Then what did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in soft garments ? Behold , those who wear fine apparel and live in luxury are in the courts or palaces of kings .
42007026	What then did you go out to see ? A prophet ( a forthteller ) ? Yes , I tell you , and far more than a prophet .
42007027	This is the one of whom it is written , Behold , I send My messenger before Your face , who shall make ready Your way before You .
42007028	I tell you , among those born of women there is no one greater than John ; but he that is inferior [ to the other citizens ] in the kingdom of God is greater [ in incomparable privilege ] than he .
42007029	And all the people who heard Him , even the tax collectors , acknowledged the justice of God [ in calling them to repentance and in pronouncing future wrath on the impenitent ] , being baptized with the baptism of John .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the lawyers [ of the Mosaic Law ] annulled and rejected and brought to nothing God’s purpose concerning themselves , by [ refusing and ] not being baptized by him [ John ] .
42007031	So to what shall I compare the men of this generation ? And what are they like ?
42007032	They are like little children sitting in the marketplace , calling to one another and saying , We piped to you [ playing wedding ] , and you did not dance ; we sang dirges and wailed [ playing funeral ] , and you did not weep .
42007033	For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , He has a demon .
42007034	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , Behold , a Man Who is a glutton and a wine drinker , a friend of tax collectors and notorious sinners .
42007035	Yet wisdom is vindicated ( shown to be true and divine ) by all her children [ by their life , character , and deeds ] .
42007036	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him , and He went into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at table .
42007037	And behold , a woman of the town who was an especially wicked sinner , when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house , brought an alabaster flask of ointment ( perfume ) .
42007038	And standing behind Him at His feet weeping , she began to wet His feet with [ her ] tears ; and she wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed His feet [ affectionately ] and anointed them with the ointment ( perfume ) .
42007039	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw it , he said to himself , If this Man were a prophet , He would surely know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him -- for she is a notorious sinner ( a social outcast , devoted to sin ) .
42007040	And Jesus , replying , said to him , Simon , I have something to say to you . And he answered , Teacher , say it .
42007041	A certain lender of money [ at interest ] had two debtors : one owed him five hundred denarii , and the other fifty .
42007042	When they had no means of paying , he freely forgave them both . Now which of them will love him more ?
42007043	Simon answered , The one , I take it , for whom he forgave and cancelled more . And Jesus said to him , You have decided correctly .
42007044	Then turning toward the woman , He said to Simon , Do you see this woman ? When I came into your house , you gave Me no water for My feet , but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
42007045	You gave Me no kiss , but she from the moment I came in has not ceased [ intermittently ] to kiss My feet tenderly and caressingly .
42007046	You did not anoint My head with [ cheap , ordinary ] oil , but she has anointed My feet with [ costly , rare ] perfume .
42007047	Therefore I tell you , her sins , many [ as they are ] , are forgiven her -- because she has loved much . But he who is forgiven little loves little .
42007048	And He said to her , Your sins are forgiven !
42007049	Then those who were at table with Him began to say among themselves , Who is this Who even forgives sins ?
42007050	But Jesus said to the woman , Your faith has saved you ; go ( enter ) into peace [ in freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ] .
42008001	SOON AFTERWARD , [ Jesus ] went on through towns and villages , preaching and bringing the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom of God . And the Twelve [ apostles ] were with Him ,
42008002	And also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had been expelled ;
42008003	And Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod’s household manager ; and Susanna ; and many others , who ministered to and provided for Him and them out of their property and personal belongings .
42008004	And when a very great throng was gathering together and people from town after town kept coming to Jesus , He said in a parable :
42008005	A sower went out to sow seed ; and as he sowed , some fell along the traveled path and was trodden underfoot , and the birds of the air ate it up .
42008006	And some [ seed ] fell on the rock , and as soon as it sprouted , it withered away because it had no moisture .
42008007	And other [ seed ] fell in the midst of the thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it [ off ] .
42008008	And some seed fell into good soil , and grew up and yielded a crop a hundred times [ as great ] . As He said these things , He called out , He who has ears to hear , let him be listening and let him consider and understand by hearing !
42008009	And when His disciples asked Him the meaning of this parable ,
42008010	He said to them , To you it has been given to [ come progressively to ] know ( to recognize and understand more strongly and clearly ) the mysteries and secrets of the kingdom of God , but for others they are in parables , so that , [ though ] looking , they may not see ; and hearing , they may not comprehend .
42008011	Now the meaning of the parable is this : The seed is the Word of God .
42008012	Those along the traveled road are the people who have heard ; then the devil comes and carries away the message out of their hearts , that they may not believe ( acknowledge Me as their Savior and devote themselves to Me ) and be saved [ here and hereafter ] .
42008013	And those upon the rock [ are the people ] who , when they hear [ the Word ] , receive and welcome it with joy ; but these have no root . They believe for a while , and in time of trial and temptation fall away ( withdraw and stand aloof ) .
42008014	And as for what fell among the thorns , these are [ the people ] who hear , but as they go on their way they are choked and suffocated with the anxieties and cares and riches and pleasures of life , and their fruit does not ripen ( come to maturity and perfection ) .
42008015	But as for that [ seed ] in the good soil , these are [ the people ] who , hearing the Word , hold it fast in a just ( noble , virtuous ) and worthy heart , and steadily bring forth fruit with patience .
42008016	No one after he has lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a [ dining table ] couch ; but he puts it on a lampstand , that those who come in may see the light .
42008017	For there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed , nor anything secret that shall not be known and come out into the open .
42008018	Be careful therefore how you listen . For to him who has [ spiritual knowledge ] will more be given ; and from him who does not have [ spiritual knowledge ] , even what he thinks and guesses and supposes that he has will be taken away .
42008019	Then Jesus’ mother and His brothers came along toward Him , but they could not get to Him because of the crowd .
42008020	And it was told Him , Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , desiring to have an interview with You .
42008021	But He answered them , My mother and My brothers are those who listen to the Word of God and do it !
42008022	One of those days He and His disciples got into a boat , and He said to them , Let us go across to the other side of the lake . So they put out to sea .
42008023	But as they were sailing , He fell off to sleep . And a whirlwind revolving from below upwards swept down on the lake , and the boat was filling with water , and they were in great danger .
42008024	And the disciples came and woke Him , saying , Master , Master , we are perishing ! And He , being thoroughly awakened , censured and blamed and rebuked the wind and the raging waves ; and they ceased , and there came a calm .
42008025	And He said to them , [ Why are you so fearful ? ] Where is your faith ( your trust , your confidence in Me -- in My veracity and My integrity ) ? And they were seized with alarm and profound and reverent dread , and they marveled , saying to one another , Who then is this , that He commands even wind and sea , and they obey Him ?
42008026	Then they came to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42008027	Now when Jesus stepped out on land , there met Him a certain man out of the town who had [ was possessed by ] demons . For a long time he had worn no clothes , and he lived not in a house but in the tombs .
42008028	And when he saw Jesus , he raised a deep ( terrible ) cry [ from the depths of his throat ] and fell down before Him [ in terror ] and shouted loudly , What have You [ to do ] with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? [ What have we in common ? ] I beg You , do not torment me !
42008029	For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For many times it had snatched and held him ; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters , but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilderness ( desert ) .
42008030	Jesus then asked him , What is your name ? And he answered , Legion ; for many demons had entered him .
42008031	And they begged [ Jesus ] not to command them to depart into the Abyss ( bottomless pit ) .
42008032	Now a great herd of swine was there feeding on the hillside ; and [ the demons ] begged Him to give them leave to enter these . And He allowed them [ to do so ] .
42008033	Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep cliff into the lake and were drowned .
42008034	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and told it in the town and in the country .
42008035	And [ people ] went out to see what had occurred , and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right ( sound ) mind ; and they were seized with alarm and fear .
42008036	And those [ also ] who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was restored [ to health ] .
42008037	Then all the people of the country surrounding the Gerasenes’ district asked [ Jesus ] to depart from them , for they were possessed and suffering with dread and terror ; so He entered a boat and returned [ to the west side of the Sea of Galilee ] .
42008038	But the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging and praying that he might accompany Him and be with Him , but [ Jesus ] sent him away , saying ,
42008039	Return to your home , and recount [ the story ] of how many and great things God has done for you . And [ the man ] departed , proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him .
42008040	Now when Jesus came back [ to Galilee ] , the crowd received and welcomed Him gladly , for they were all waiting and looking for Him .
42008041	And there came a man named Jairus , who had [ for a long time ] been a director of the synagogue ; and falling at the feet of Jesus , he begged Him to come to his house ,
42008042	For he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . As [ Jesus ] went , the people pressed together around Him [ almost suffocating Him ] .
42008043	And a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years and had spent all her living upon physicians , and could not be healed by anyone ,
42008044	Came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment , and immediately her flow of blood ceased .
42008045	And Jesus said , Who is it who touched Me ? When all were denying it , Peter and those who were with him said , Master , the multitudes surround You and press You on every side !
42008046	But Jesus said , Someone did touch Me ; for I perceived that [ healing ] power has gone forth from Me .
42008047	And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice , she came up trembling , and , falling down before Him , she declared in the presence of all the people for what reason she had touched Him and how she had been instantly cured .
42008048	And He said to her , Daughter , your faith ( your confidence and trust in Me ) has made you well ! Go ( enter ) into peace ( untroubled , undisturbed well-being ) .
42008049	While He was still speaking , a man from the house of the director of the synagogue came and said [ to Jairus ] , Your daughter is dead ; do not weary and trouble the Teacher any further .
42008050	But Jesus , on hearing this , answered him , Do not be seized with alarm or struck with fear ; simply believe [ in Me as able to do this ] , and she shall be made well .
42008051	And when He came to the house , He permitted no one to enter with Him except Peter and John and James , and the girl’s father and mother .
42008052	And all were weeping for and bewailing her ; but He said , Do not weep , for she is not dead but sleeping .
42008053	And they laughed Him to scorn , knowing full well that she was dead .
42008054	And grasping her hand , He called , saying , Child , arise [ from the sleep of death ] !
42008055	And her spirit returned [ from death ] , and she arose immediately ; and He directed that she should be given something to eat .
42008056	And her parents were amazed , but He charged them to tell no one what had occurred .
42009001	THEN JESUS called together the Twelve [ apostles ] and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases ,
42009002	And He sent them out to announce and preach the kingdom of God and to bring healing .
42009003	And He said to them , Do not take anything for your journey -- neither walking stick , nor wallet [ for a collection bag ] , nor food of any kind , nor money , and do not have two undergarments ( tunics ) .
42009004	And whatever house you enter , stay there until you go away [ from that place ] .
42009005	And wherever they do not receive and accept and welcome you , when you leave that town shake off [ even ] the dust from your feet , as a testimony against them .
42009006	And departing , they went about from village to village , preaching the Gospel and restoring the afflicted to health everywhere .
42009007	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was being done by [ Jesus ] , and he was [ thoroughly ] perplexed and troubled , because it was said by some that John [ the Baptist ] had been raised from the dead ,
42009008	And by others that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the prophets of old had come back to life .
42009009	But Herod said , John I beheaded ; but Who is this about Whom I [ learn ] such things by hearsay ? And he sought to see Him .
42009010	Upon their return , the apostles reported to Jesus all that they had done . And He took them [ along with Him ] and withdrew into privacy near a town called Bethsaida .
42009011	But when the crowds learned of it , [ they ] followed Him ; and He welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God , and healed those who needed restoration to health .
42009012	Now the day began to decline , and the Twelve came and said to Him , Dismiss the crowds and send them away , so that they may go to the neighboring hamlets and villages and the surrounding country and find lodging and get a supply of provisions , for we are here in an uninhabited ( barren , solitary ) place .
42009013	But He said to them , You [ yourselves ] give them [ food ] to eat . They said , We have no more than five loaves and two fish -- unless we are to go and buy food for all this crowd ,
42009014	For there were about 5,000 men . And [ Jesus ] said to His disciples , Have them [ sit down ] reclining in table groups ( companies ) of about fifty each .
42009015	And they did so , and made them all recline .
42009016	And taking the five loaves and the two fish , He looked up to heaven and [ praising God ] gave thanks and asked Him to bless them [ to their use ] . Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples to place before the multitude .
42009017	And all the people ate and were satisfied . And they gathered up what remained over -- twelve [ small hand ] baskets of broken pieces .
42009018	Now it occurred that as Jesus was praying privately , the disciples were with Him , and He asked them , Who do men say that I am ?
42009019	And they answered , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elijah ; and others , that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life .
42009020	And He said to them , But who do you [ yourselves ] say that I am ? And Peter replied , The Christ of God !
42009021	But He strictly charged and sharply commanded them [ under penalty ] to tell this to no one [ no one , whoever he might be ] ,
42009022	Saying , The Son of Man must suffer many things and be [ deliberately ] disapproved and repudiated and rejected on the part of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be put to death and on the third day be raised [ again ] .
42009023	And He said to all , If any person wills to come after Me , let him deny himself [ disown himself , forget , lose sight of himself and his own interests , refuse and give up himself ] and take up his cross daily and follow Me [ cleave steadfastly to Me , conform wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying also ] .
42009024	For whoever would preserve his life and save it will lose and destroy it , but whoever loses his life for My sake , he will preserve and save it [ from the penalty of eternal death ] .
42009025	For what does it profit a man , if he gains the whole world and ruins or forfeits ( loses ) himself ?
42009026	Because whoever is ashamed of Me and of My teachings , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the [ threefold ] glory ( the splendor and majesty ) of Himself and of the Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	However I tell you truly , there are some of those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God .
42009028	Now about eight days after these teachings , Jesus took with Him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray .
42009029	And as He was praying , the appearance of His countenance became altered ( different ) , and His raiment became dazzling white [ flashing with the brilliance of lightning ] .
42009030	And behold , two men were conversing with Him -- Moses and Elijah ,
42009031	Who appeared in splendor and majesty and brightness and were speaking of His exit [ from life ] , which He was about to bring to realization at Jerusalem .
42009032	Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep , but when they fully awoke , they saw His glory ( splendor and majesty and brightness ) and the two men who stood with Him .
42009033	And it occurred as the men were parting from Him that Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is delightful and good that we are here ; and let us construct three booths or huts -- one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah ! not noticing or knowing what he was saying .
42009034	But even as he was saying this , a cloud came and began to overshadow them , and they were seized with alarm and struck with fear as they entered into the cloud .
42009035	Then there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is My Son , My Chosen One or My Beloved ; listen to and yield to and obey Him !
42009036	And when the voice had died away , Jesus was found there alone . And they kept still , and told no one at that time any of these things that they had seen .
42009037	Now it occurred the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met Him .
42009038	And behold , a man from the crowd shouted out , Master , I implore You to look at my son , for he is my only child ;
42009039	And behold , a spirit seizes him and suddenly he cries out ; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth ; and he is sorely shattered , and it will scarcely leave him .
42009040	And I implored Your disciples to drive it out , but they could not .
42009041	Jesus answered , O [ faithless ones ] unbelieving and without trust in God , a perverse ( wayward , crooked and warped ) generation ! Until when and how long am I to be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son here [ to Me ] .
42009042	And even while he was coming , the demon threw him down and [ completely ] convulsed him . But Jesus censured and severely rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and restored him to his father .
42009043	And all were astounded at the evidence of God’s mighty power and His majesty and magnificence . But [ while ] they were all marveling at everything Jesus was doing , He said to His disciples ,
42009044	Let these words sink into your ears : the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men [ whose conduct is opposed to God ] .
42009045	However , they did not comprehend this saying ; and it was kept hidden from them , so that they should not grasp it and understand , and they were afraid to ask Him about the statement .
42009046	But a controversy arose among them as to which of them might be the greatest [ surpassing the others in excellence , worth , and authority ] .
42009047	But Jesus , as He perceived the thoughts of their hearts , took a little child and put him at His side
42009048	And told them , Whoever receives and accepts and welcomes this child in My name and for My sake receives and accepts and welcomes Me ; and whoever so receives Me so also receives Him Who sent Me . For he who is least and lowliest among you all -- he is [ the one who is truly ] great .
42009049	John said , Master , we saw a man driving out demons in Your name and we commanded him to stop it , for he does not follow along with us .
42009050	But Jesus told him , Do not forbid [ such people ] ; for whoever is not against you is for you .
42009051	Now when the time was almost come for Jesus to be received up [ to heaven ] , He steadfastly and determinedly set His face to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	And He sent messengers before Him ; and they reached and entered a Samaritan village to make [ things ] ready for Him ;
42009053	But [ the people ] would not welcome or receive or accept Him , because His face was [ set as if He was ] going to Jerusalem .
42009054	And when His disciples James and John observed this , they said , Lord , do You wish us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them , even as Elijah did ?
42009055	But He turned and rebuked and severely censured them . He said , You do not know of what sort of spirit you are ,
42009056	For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men’s lives , but to save them [ from the penalty of eternal death ] . And they journeyed on to another village .
42009057	And it occurred that as they were going along the road , a man said to Him , Lord , I will follow You wherever You go .
42009058	And Jesus told him , Foxes have lurking holes and the birds of the air have roosts and nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head .
42009059	And He said to another , Become My disciple , side with My party , and accompany Me ! But he replied , Lord , permit me first to go and bury ( await the death of ) my father .
42009060	But Jesus said to him , Allow the dead to bury their own dead ; but as for you , go and publish abroad throughout all regions the kingdom of God .
42009061	Another also said , I will follow You , Lord , and become Your disciple and side with Your party ; but let me first say good-bye to those at my home .
42009062	Jesus said to him , No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back [ to the things behind ] is fit for the kingdom of God .
42010001	NOW AFTER this the Lord chose and appointed seventy others and sent them out ahead of Him , two by two , into every town and place where He Himself was about to come ( visit ) .
42010002	And He said to them , The harvest indeed is abundant [ there is much ripe grain ] , but the farmhands are few . Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest .
42010003	Go your way ; behold , I send you out like lambs into the midst of wolves .
42010004	Carry no purse , no provisions bag , no [ change of ] sandals ; refrain from [ retarding your journey by ] saluting and wishing anyone well along the way .
42010005	Whatever house you enter , first say , Peace be to this household ! [ Freedom from all the distresses that result from sin be with this family ] .
42010006	And if anyone [ worthy ] of peace and blessedness is there , the peace and blessedness you wish shall come upon him ; but if not , it shall come back to you .
42010007	And stay on in the same house , eating and drinking what they provide , for the laborer is worthy of his wages . Do not keep moving from house to house .
42010008	Whenever you go into a town and they receive and accept and welcome you , eat what is set before you ;
42010009	And heal the sick in it and say to them , The kingdom of God has come close to you .
42010010	But whenever you go into a town and they do not receive and accept and welcome you , go out into its streets and say ,
42010011	Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we are wiping off against you ; yet know and understand this : the kingdom of God has come near you .
42010012	I tell you , it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that town .
42010013	Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
42010014	However , it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
42010015	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted unto heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades ( the regions of the dead ) .
42010016	He who hears and heeds you [ disciples ] hears and heeds Me ; and he who slights and rejects you slights and rejects Me ; and he who slights and rejects Me slights and rejects Him who sent Me .
42010017	The seventy returned with joy , saying , Lord , even the demons are subject to us in Your name !
42010018	And He said to them , I saw Satan falling like a lightning [ flash ] from heaven .
42010019	Behold ! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions , and [ physical and mental strength and ability ] over all the power that the enemy [ possesses ] ; and nothing shall in any way harm you .
42010020	Nevertheless , do not rejoice at this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven .
42010021	In that same hour He rejoiced and gloried in the Holy Spirit and said , I thank You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have concealed these things [ relating to salvation ] from the wise and understanding and learned , and revealed them to babes ( the childish , unskilled , and untaught ) . Yes , Father , for such was Your gracious will and choice and good pleasure .
42010022	All things have been given over into My power by My Father ; and no one knows Who the Son is except the Father , or Who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son may choose to reveal and make Him known .
42010023	Then turning to His disciples , He said privately , Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) are those whose eyes see what you see !
42010024	For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see and they did not see it , and to hear what you hear and they did not hear it .
42010025	And then a certain lawyer arose to try ( test , tempt ) Him , saying , Teacher , what am I to do to inherit everlasting life [ that is , to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah’s kingdom ] ?
42010026	Jesus said to him , What is written in the Law ? How do you read it ?
42010027	And he replied , You must love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself .
42010028	And Jesus said to him , You have answered correctly ; do this , and you will live [ enjoy active , blessed , endless life in the kingdom of God ] .
42010029	And he , determined to acquit himself of reproach , said to Jesus , And who is my neighbor ?
42010030	Jesus , taking him up , replied , A certain man was going from Jerusalem down to Jericho , and he fell among robbers , who stripped him of his clothes and belongings and beat him and went their way , [ unconcernedly ] leaving him half dead , as it happened .
42010031	Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down along that road , and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
42010032	A Levite likewise came down to the place and saw him , and passed by on the other side [ of the road ] .
42010033	But a certain Samaritan , as he traveled along , came down to where he was ; and when he saw him , he was moved with pity and sympathy [ for him ] ,
42010034	And went to him and dressed his wounds , pouring on [ them ] oil and wine . Then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him .
42010035	And the next day he took out two denarii [ two day’s wages ] and gave [ them ] to the innkeeper , saying , Take care of him ; and whatever more you spend , I [ myself ] will repay you when I return .
42010036	Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers ?
42010037	He answered , The one who showed pity and mercy to him . And Jesus said to him , Go and do likewise .
42010038	Now while they were on their way , it occurred that Jesus entered a certain village , and a woman named Martha received and welcomed Him into her house .
42010039	And she had a sister named Mary , who seated herself at the Lord’s feet and was listening to His teaching .
42010040	But Martha [ overly occupied and too busy ] was distracted with much serving ; and she came up to Him and said , Lord , is it nothing to You that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Tell her then to help me [ to lend a hand and do her part along with me ] !
42010041	But the Lord replied to her by saying , Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled about many things ;
42010042	There is need of only one or but a few things . Mary has chosen the good portion [ that which is to her advantage ] , which shall not be taken away from her .
42011001	THEN HE was praying in a certain place ; and when He stopped , one of His disciples said to Him , Lord , teach us to pray , [ just ] as John taught his disciples .
42011002	And He said to them , When you pray , say : Our Father Who is in heaven , hallowed be Your name , Your kingdom come . Your will be done [ held holy and revered ] on earth as it is in heaven .
42011003	Give us daily our bread [ food for the morrow ] .
42011004	And forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us [ who has offended us or done us wrong ] . And bring us not into temptation but rescue us from evil .
42011005	And He said to them , Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and will say to him , Friend , lend me three loaves [ of bread ] ,
42011006	For a friend of mine who is on a journey has just come , and I have nothing to put before him ;
42011007	And he from within will answer , Do not disturb me ; the door is now closed , and my children are with me in bed ; I cannot get up and supply you [ with anything ] ?
42011008	I tell you , although he will not get up and supply him anything because he is his friend , yet because of his shameless persistence and insistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs .
42011009	So I say to you , Ask and keep on asking and it shall be given you ; seek and keep on seeking and you shall find ; knock and keep on knocking and the door shall be opened to you .
42011010	For everyone who asks and keeps on asking receives ; and he who seeks and keeps on seeking finds ; and to him who knocks and keeps on knocking , the door shall be opened .
42011011	What father among you , if his son asks for a loaf of bread , will give him a stone ; or if he asks for a fish , will instead of a fish give him a serpent ?
42011012	Or if he asks for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
42011013	If you then , evil as you are , know how to give good gifts [ gifts that are to their advantage ] to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and continue to ask Him !
42011014	Now Jesus was driving out a demon that was dumb ; and it occurred that when the demon had gone out , the dumb man spoke . And the crowds marveled .
42011015	But some of them said , He drives out demons [ because He is in league with and ] by Beelzebub , the prince of demons ,
42011016	While others , to try and test and tempt Him , demanded a sign of Him from heaven .
42011017	But He , [ well ] aware of their intent and purpose , said to them , Every kingdom split up against itself is doomed and brought to desolation , and so house falls upon house . [ The disunited household will collapse . ]
42011018	And if Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom last ? For you say that I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub .
42011019	Now if I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub , with whose help and by whom do your sons drive them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
42011020	But if I drive out the demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has [ already ] come upon you .
42011021	When the strong man , fully armed , [ from his courtyard ] guards his own dwelling , his belongings are undisturbed [ his property is at peace and is secure ] .
42011022	But when one stronger than he attacks him and conquers him , he robs him of his whole armor on which he had relied and divides up and distributes all his goods as plunder ( spoil ) .
42011023	He who is not with Me [ siding and believing with Me ] is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me [ engage in My interest ] , scatters .
42011024	When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person , it roams through waterless places in search [ of a place ] of rest ( release , refreshment , ease ) ; and finding none it says , I will go back to my house from which I came .
42011025	And when it arrives , it finds [ the place ] swept and put in order and furnished and decorated .
42011026	And it goes and brings other spirits , seven [ of them ] , more evil than itself , and they enter in , settle down , and dwell there ; and the last state of that person is worse than the first .
42011027	Now it occurred that as He was saying these things , a certain woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him , Blessed ( happy and to be envied ) is the womb that bore You and the breasts that You sucked !
42011028	But He said , Blessed ( happy and to be envied ) rather are those who hear the Word of God and obey and practice it !
42011029	Now as the crowds were [ increasingly ] thronging Him , He began to say , This present generation is a wicked one ; it seeks and demands a sign ( miracle ) , but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah [ the prophet ] .
42011030	For [ just ] as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh , so will also the Son of Man be [ a sign ] to this age and generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will arise in the judgment with the people of this age and generation and condemn them ; for she came from the ends of the [ inhabited ] earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon , and notice , here is more than Solomon .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will appear as witnesses at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it ; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , here is more than Jonah .
42011033	No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or crypt or under a bushel measure , but on a lampstand , that those who are coming in may see the light .
42011034	Your eye is the lamp of your body ; when your eye ( your conscience ) is sound and fulfilling its office , your whole body is full of light ; but when it is not sound and is not fulfilling its office , your body is full of darkness .
42011035	Be careful , therefore , that the light that is in you is not darkness .
42011036	If then your entire body is illuminated , having no part dark , it will be wholly bright [ with light ] , as when a lamp with its bright rays gives you light .
42011037	Now while Jesus was speaking , a Pharisee invited Him to take dinner with him , so He entered and reclined at table .
42011038	The Pharisee noticed and was astonished [ to see ] that Jesus did not first wash before dinner .
42011039	But the Lord said to him , Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate , but inside you yourselves are full of greed and robbery and extortion and malice and wickedness .
42011040	You senseless ( foolish , stupid ) ones [ acting without reflection or intelligence ] ! Did not He Who made the outside make the inside also ?
42011041	But [ dedicate your inner self and ] give as donations to the poor of those things which are within [ of inward righteousness ] and behold , everything is purified and clean for you .
42011042	But woe to you , Pharisees ! For you tithe mint and rue and every [ little ] herb , but disregard and neglect justice and the love of God . These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone .
42011043	Woe to you , Pharisees ! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and [ you love ] to be greeted and bowed down to in the [ public ] marketplaces .
42011044	Woe to you ! For you are like graves which are not marked or seen , and men walk over them without being aware of it [ and are ceremonially defiled ] .
42011045	One of the experts in the [ Mosaic ] Law answered Him , Teacher , in saying this , You reproach and outrage and affront even us !
42011046	But He said , Woe to you , the lawyers , also ! For you load men with oppressive burdens hard to bear , and you do not personally [ even gently ] touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
42011047	Woe to you ! For you are rebuilding and repairing the tombs of the prophets , whom your fathers killed ( destroyed ) .
42011048	So you bear witness and give your full approval and consent to the deeds of your fathers ; for they actually killed them , and you rebuild and repair monuments to them .
42011049	For this reason also the wisdom of God said , I will send them prophets and apostles , [ some ] of whom they will put to death and persecute ,
42011050	So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against and required of this age and generation ,
42011051	From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , it shall be charged against and required of this age and generation .
42011052	Woe to you , lawyers ( experts in the Mosaic Law ) ! For you have taken away the key to knowledge ; you did not go in yourselves , and you hindered and prevented those who were entering .
42011053	As He left there , the scribes and the Pharisees [ followed Him closely , and they ] began to be enraged with and set themselves violently against Him and to draw Him out and provoke Him to speak of many things ,
42011054	Secretly watching and plotting and lying in wait for Him , to seize upon something He might say [ that they might accuse Him ] .
42012001	IN THE meanwhile , when so many thousands of the people had gathered that they were trampling on one another , Jesus commenced by saying primarily to His disciples , Be on your guard against the leaven ( ferment ) of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy [ producing unrest and violent agitation ] .
42012002	Nothing is [ so closely ] covered up that it will not be revealed , or hidden that it will not be known .
42012003	Whatever you have spoken in the darkness shall be heard and listened to in the light , and what you have whispered in [ people’s ] ears and behind closed doors will be proclaimed upon the housetops .
42012004	I tell you , My friends , do not dread and be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do .
42012005	But I will warn you whom you should fear : fear Him Who , after killing , has power to hurl into hell ( Gehenna ) ; yes , I say to you , fear Him !
42012006	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? And [ yet ] not one of them is forgotten or uncared for in the presence of God .
42012007	But [ even ] the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Do not be struck with fear or seized with alarm ; you are of greater worth than many [ flocks ] of sparrows .
42012008	And I tell you , Whoever declares openly [ speaking out freely ] and confesses that he is My worshiper and acknowledges Me before men , the Son of Man also will declare and confess and acknowledge him before the angels of God .
42012009	But he who disowns and denies and rejects and refuses to acknowledge Me before men will be disowned and denied and rejected and refused acknowledgement in the presence of the angels of God .
42012010	And everyone who makes a statement or speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [ that is , whoever intentionally comes short of the reverence due the Holy Spirit ] , it will not be forgiven him [ for him there is no forgiveness ] .
42012011	And when they bring you before the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities , do not be anxious [ beforehand ] how you shall reply in defense or what you are to say .
42012012	For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour and moment what [ you ] ought to say .
42012013	Someone from the crowd said to Him , Master , order my brother to divide the inheritance and share it with me .
42012014	But He told him , Man , who has appointed Me a judge or umpire and divider over you ?
42012015	And He said to them , Guard yourselves and keep free from all covetousness ( the immoderate desire for wealth , the greedy longing to have more ) ; for a man’s life does not consist in and is not derived from possessing overflowing abundance or that which is over and above his needs .
42012016	Then He told them a parable , saying , The land of a rich man was fertile and yielded plentifully .
42012017	And he considered and debated within himself , What shall I do ? I have no place [ in which ] to gather together my harvest .
42012018	And he said , I will do this : I will pull down my storehouses and build larger ones , and there I will store all my grain or produce and my goods .
42012019	And I will say to my soul , Soul , you have many good things laid up , [ enough ] for many years . Take your ease ; eat , drink , and enjoy yourself merrily .
42012020	But God said to him , You fool ! This very night they [ the messengers of God ] will demand your soul of you ; and all the things that you have prepared , whose will they be ?
42012021	So it is with the one who continues to lay up and hoard possessions for himself and is not rich [ in his relation ] to God [ this is how he fares ] .
42012022	And [ Jesus ] said to His disciples , Therefore I tell you , do not be anxious and troubled [ with cares ] about your life , as to what you will [ have to ] eat ; or about your body , as to what you will [ have to ] wear .
42012023	For life is more than food , and the body [ more ] than clothes .
42012024	Observe and consider the ravens ; for they neither sow nor reap , they have neither storehouse nor barn ; and [ yet ] God feeds them . Of how much more worth are you than the birds !
42012025	And which of you by being overly anxious and troubled with cares can add a cubit to his stature or a moment [ unit ] of time to his age [ the length of his life ] ?
42012026	If then you are not able to do such a little thing as that , why are you anxious and troubled with cares about the rest ?
42012027	Consider the lilies , how they grow . They neither [ wearily ] toil nor spin nor weave ; yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his glory ( his splendor and magnificence ) was not arrayed like one of these .
42012028	But if God so clothes the grass in the field , which is alive today , and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more will He clothe you , O you [ people ] of little faith ?
42012029	And you , do not seek [ by meditating and reasoning to inquire into ] what you are to eat and what you are to drink ; nor be of anxious ( troubled ) mind [ unsettled , excited , worried , and in suspense ] ;
42012030	For all the pagan world is [ greedily ] seeking these things , and your Father knows that you need them .
42012031	Only aim at and strive for and seek His kingdom , and all these things shall be supplied to you also .
42012032	Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear , little flock , for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom !
42012033	Sell what you possess and give donations to the poor ; provide yourselves with purses and handbags that do not grow old , an unfailing and inexhaustible treasure in the heavens , where no thief comes near and no moth destroys .
42012034	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
42012035	Keep your loins girded and your lamps burning ,
42012036	And be like men who are waiting for their master to return home from the marriage feast , so that when he returns from the wedding and comes and knocks , they may open to him immediately .
42012037	Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) are those servants whom the master finds awake and alert and watching when he comes . Truly I say to you , he will gird himself and have them recline at table and will come and serve them !
42012038	If he comes in the second watch ( before midnight ) or the third watch ( after midnight ) , and finds them so , blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) are those servants !
42012039	But of this be assured : if the householder had known at what time the burglar was coming , he would have been awake and alert and watching and would not have permitted his house to be dug through and broken into .
42012040	You also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour and a moment when you do not anticipate it .
42012041	Peter said , Lord , are You telling this parable for us , or for all alike ?
42012042	And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful steward , the wise man whom his master will set over those in his household service to supply them their allowance of food at the appointed time ?
42012043	Blessed ( happy and to be envied ) is that servant whom his master finds so doing when he arrives .
42012044	Truly I tell you , he will set him in charge over all his possessions .
42012045	But if that servant says in his heart , My master is late in coming , and begins to strike the menservants and the maids and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
42012046	The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he does not know , and will punish him and cut him off and assign his lot with the unfaithful .
42012047	And that servant who knew his master’s will but did not get ready or act as he would wish him to act shall be beaten with many [ lashes ] .
42012048	But he who did not know and did things worthy of a beating shall be beaten with few [ lashes ] . For everyone to whom much is given , of him shall much be required ; and of him to whom men entrust much , they will require and demand all the more .
42012049	I have come to cast fire upon the earth , and how I wish that it were already kindled !
42012050	I have a baptism with which to be baptized , and how greatly and sorely I am urged on ( impelled , constrained ) until it is accomplished !
42012051	Do you suppose that I have come to give peace upon earth ? No , I say to you , but rather division ;
42012052	For from now on in one house there will be five divided [ among themselves ] , three against two and two against three .
42012053	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
42012054	He also said to the crowds of people , When you see a cloud rising in the west , at once you say , It is going to rain ! And so it does .
42012055	And when [ you see that ] a south wind is blowing , you say , There will be severe heat ! And it occurs .
42012056	You playactors ( hypocrites ) ! You know how [ intelligently ] to discern and interpret and prove the looks of the earth and sky ; but how is it that you do not know how to discern and interpret and apply the proof to this present time ?
42012057	And why do you not judge what is just and personally decide what is right ?
42012058	Then as you go with your accuser before a magistrate , on the way make a diligent effort to settle and be quit ( free ) of him , lest he drag you to the judge , and the judge turn you over to the officer , and the officer put you in prison .
42012059	I tell you , you will never get out until you have paid the very last [ fraction of a ] cent .
42013001	JUST AT that time there [ arrived ] some people who informed Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices .
42013002	And He replied by saying to them , Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans because they have suffered in this way ?
42013003	I tell you , No ; but unless you repent ( change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ) , you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally .
42013004	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them -- do you think that they were more guilty offenders ( debtors ) than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem ?
42013005	I tell you , No ; but unless you repent ( change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ) , you will all likewise perish and be lost eternally .
42013006	And He told them this parable : A certain man had a fig tree , planted in his vineyard , and he came looking for fruit on it , but did not find [ any ] .
42013007	So he said to the vinedresser , See here ! For these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and I find none . Cut it down ! Why should it continue also to use up the ground [ to deplete the soil , intercept the sun , and take up room ] ?
42013008	But he replied to him , Leave it alone , sir , [ just ] this one more year , till I dig around it and put manure [ on the soil ] .
42013009	Then perhaps it will bear fruit after this ; but if not , you can cut it down and out .
42013010	Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
42013011	And there was a woman there who for eighteen years had had an infirmity caused by a spirit ( a demon of sickness ) . She was bent completely forward and utterly unable to straighten herself up or to look upward .
42013012	And when Jesus saw her , He called [ her to Him ] and said to her , Woman , you are released from your infirmity !
42013013	Then He laid [ His ] hands on her , and instantly she was made straight , and she recognized and thanked and praised God .
42013014	But the leader of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , said to the crowd , There are six days on which work ought to be done ; so come on those days and be cured , and not on the Sabbath day .
42013015	But the Lord replied to him , saying , You playactors ( hypocrites ) ! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it out to water it ?
42013016	And ought not this woman , a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day ?
42013017	Even as He said this , all His opponents were put to shame , and all the people were rejoicing over all the glorious things that were being done by Him .
42013018	This led Him to say , What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
42013019	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and planted in his own garden ; and it grew and became a tree , and the wild birds found shelter and roosted and nested in its branches .
42013020	And again He said , To what shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
42013021	It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of wheat flour or meal until it was all leavened ( fermented ) .
42013022	[ Jesus ] journeyed on through towns and villages , teaching , and making His way toward Jerusalem .
42013023	And someone asked Him , Lord , will only a few be saved ( rescued , delivered from the penalties of the last judgment , and made partakers of the salvation by Christ ) ? And He said to them ,
42013024	Strive to enter by the narrow door [ force yourselves through it ] , for many , I tell you , will try to enter and will not be able .
42013025	When once the Master of the house gets up and closes the door , and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door [ again and again ] , saying , Lord , open to us ! He will answer you , I do not know where [ what household -- certainly not Mine ] you come from .
42013026	Then you will begin to say , We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets .
42013027	But He will say , I tell you , I do not know where [ what household -- certainly not Mine ] you come from ; depart from Me , all you wrongdoers !
42013028	There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but you yourselves being cast forth ( banished , driven away ) .
42013029	And [ people ] will come from east and west , and from north and south , and sit down ( feast at table ) in the kingdom of God .
42013030	And behold , there are some [ now ] last who will be first [ then ] , and there are some [ now ] first who will be last [ then ] .
42013031	At that very hour some Pharisees came up and said to Him , Go away from here , for Herod is determined to kill You .
42013032	And He said to them , Go and tell that fox [ sly and crafty , skulking and cowardly ] , Behold , I drive out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I finish ( complete ) My course .
42013033	Nevertheless , I must continue on My way today and tomorrow and the day after that -- for it will never do for a prophet to be destroyed away from Jerusalem !
42013034	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who continue to kill the prophets and to stone those who are sent to you ! How often I have desired and yearned to gather your children together [ around Me ] , as a hen [ gathers ] her young under her wings , but you would not !
42013035	Behold , your house is forsaken ( abandoned , left to you destitute of God’s help ) ! And I tell you , you will not see Me again until the time comes when you shall say , Blessed ( to be celebrated with praises ) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord !
42014001	IT OCCURRED one Sabbath , when [ Jesus ] went for a meal at the house of one of the ruling Pharisees , that they were [ engaged in ] watching Him [ closely ] .
42014002	And behold , [ just ] in front of Him there was a man who had dropsy .
42014003	And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees , Is it lawful and right to cure on the Sabbath or not ?
42014004	But they kept silent . Then He took hold [ of the man ] and cured him and sent him away .
42014005	And He said to them , Which of you , having a son or a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a well , will not at once pull him out on the Sabbath day ?
42014006	And they were unable to reply to this .
42014007	Now He told a parable to those who were invited , [ when ] He noticed how they were selecting the places of honor , saying to them ,
42014008	When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast , do not recline on the chief seat [ in the place of honor ] , lest a more distinguished person than you has been invited by him ,
42014009	And he who invited both of you will come to you and say , Let this man have the place [ you have taken ] . Then , with humiliation and a guilty sense of impropriety , you will begin to take the lowest place .
42014010	But when you are invited , go and recline in the lowest place , so that when your host comes in , he may say to you , Friend , go up higher ! Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit [ at table ] with you .
42014011	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled ( ranked below others who are honored or rewarded ) , and he who humbles himself ( keeps a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly ) will be exalted ( elevated in rank ) .
42014012	Jesus also said to the man who had invited Him , When you give a dinner or a supper , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors , lest perhaps they also invite you in return , and so you are paid back .
42014013	But when you give a banquet or a reception , invite the poor , the disabled , the lame , and the blind .
42014014	Then you will be blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) , because they have no way of repaying you , and you will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just ( upright ) .
42014015	When one of those who reclined [ at the table ] with Him heard this , he said to Him , Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God !
42014016	But Jesus said to him , A man was once giving a great supper and invited many ;
42014017	And at the hour for the supper he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited , Come , for all is now ready .
42014018	But they all alike began to make excuses and to beg off . The first said to him , I have bought a piece of land , and I have to go out and see it ; I beg you , have me excused .
42014019	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to examine and put my approval on them ; I beg you , have me excused .
42014020	And another said , I have married a wife , and because of this I am unable to come .
42014021	So the servant came and reported these [ answers ] to his master . Then the master of the house said in wrath to his servant , Go quickly into the great streets and the small streets of the city and bring in here the poor and the disabled and the blind and the lame .
42014022	And the servant [ returning ] said , Sir , what you have commanded me to do has been done , and yet there is room .
42014023	Then the master said to the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges and urge and constrain [ them ] to yield and come in , so that my house may be filled .
42014024	For I tell you , not one of those who were invited shall taste my supper .
42014025	Now huge crowds were going along with [ Jesus ] , and He turned and said to them ,
42014026	If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his [ own ] father and mother [ in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God ] and [ likewise ] his wife and children and brothers and sisters -- [ yes ] and even his own life also -- he cannot be My disciple .
42014027	Whoever does not persevere and carry his own cross and come after ( follow ) Me cannot be My disciple .
42014028	For which of you , wishing to build a farm building , does not first sit down and calculate the cost [ to see ] whether he has sufficient means to finish it ?
42014029	Otherwise , when he has laid the foundation and is unable to complete [ the building ] , all who see it will begin to mock and jeer at him ,
42014030	Saying , This man began to build and was not able ( worth enough ) to finish .
42014031	Or what king , going out to engage in conflict with another king , will not first sit down and consider and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand [ men ] to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	And if he cannot [ do so ] , when the other king is still a great way off , he sends an envoy and asks the terms of peace .
42014033	So then , any of you who does not forsake ( renounce , surrender claim to , give up , say good-bye to ) all that he has cannot be My disciple .
42014034	Salt is good [ an excellent thing ] , but if salt has lost its strength and has become saltless ( insipid , flat ) , how shall its saltness be restored ?
42014035	It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap ; men throw it away . He who has ears to hear , let him listen and consider and comprehend by hearing !
42015001	NOW THE tax collectors and [ notorious and especially wicked ] sinners were all coming near to [ Jesus ] to listen to Him .
42015002	And the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering and indignantly complaining , saying , This man accepts and receives and welcomes [ preeminently wicked ] sinners and eats with them .
42015003	So He told them this parable :
42015004	What man of you , if he has a hundred sheep and should lose one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness ( desert ) and go after the one that is lost until he finds it ?
42015005	And when he has found it , he lays it on his [ own ] shoulders , rejoicing .
42015006	And when he gets home , he summons together [ his ] friends and [ his ] neighbors , saying to them , Rejoice with me , because I have found my sheep which was lost .
42015007	Thus , I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one [ especially ] wicked person who repents ( changes his mind , abhorring his errors and misdeeds , and determines to enter upon a better course of life ) than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance .
42015008	Or what woman , having ten [ silver ] drachmas [ each one equal to a day’s wages ] , if she loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look carefully and diligently until she finds it ?
42015009	And when she has found it , she summons her [ women ] friends and neighbors , saying , Rejoice with me , for I have found the silver coin which I had lost .
42015010	Even so , I tell you , there is joy among and in the presence of the angels of God over one [ especially ] wicked person who repents ( changes his mind for the better , heartily amending his ways , with abhorrence of his past sins ) .
42015011	And He said , There was a certain man who had two sons ;
42015012	And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the part of the property that falls [ to me ] . And he divided the estate between them .
42015013	And not many days after that , the younger son gathered up all that he had and journeyed into a distant country , and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and loose [ from restraint ] living .
42015014	And when he had spent all he had , a mighty famine came upon that country , and he began to fall behind and be in want .
42015015	So he went and forced ( glued ) himself upon one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed hogs .
42015016	And he would gladly have fed on and filled his belly with the carob pods that the hogs were eating , but [ they could not satisfy his hunger and ] nobody gave him anything [ better ] .
42015017	Then when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father have enough food , and [ even food ] to spare , but I am perishing ( dying ) here of hunger !
42015018	I will get up and go to my father , and I will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight .
42015019	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; [ just ] make me like one of your hired servants .
42015020	So he got up and came to his [ own ] father . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was moved with pity and tenderness [ for him ] ; and he ran and embraced him and kissed him [ fervently ] .
42015021	And the son said to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son [ I no longer deserve to be recognized as a son of yours ] !
42015022	But the father said to his bond servants , Bring quickly the best robe ( the festive robe of honor ) and put it on him ; and give him a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet .
42015023	And bring out that [ wheat- ] fattened calf and kill it ; and let us revel and feast and be happy and make merry ,
42015024	Because this my son was dead and is alive again ; he was lost and is found ! And they began to revel and feast and make merry .
42015025	But his older son was in the field ; and as he returned and came near the house , he heard music and dancing .
42015026	And having called one of the servant [ boys ] to him , he began to ask what this meant .
42015027	And he said to him , Your brother has come , and your father has killed that [ wheat- ] fattened calf , because he has received him back safe and well .
42015028	But [ the elder brother ] was angry [ with deep-seated wrath ] and resolved not to go in . Then his father came out and began to plead with him ,
42015029	But he answered his father , Look ! These many years I have served you , and I have never disobeyed your command . Yet you never gave me [ so much as ] a [ little ] kid , that I might revel and feast and be happy and make merry with my friends ;
42015030	But when this son of yours arrived , who has devoured your estate with immoral women , you have killed for him that [ wheat- ] fattened calf !
42015031	And the father said to him , Son , you are always with me , and all that is mine is yours .
42015032	But it was fitting to make merry , to revel and feast and rejoice , for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again ! He was lost and is found !
42016001	ALSO [ Jesus ] said to the disciples , There was a certain rich man who had a manager of his estate , and accusations [ against this man ] were brought to him , that he was squandering his [ master’s ] possessions .
42016002	And he called him and said to him , What is this that I hear about you ? Turn in the account of your management [ of my affairs ] , for you can be [ my ] manager no longer .
42016003	And the manager of the estate said to himself , What shall I do , seeing that my master is taking the management away from me ? I am not able to dig , and I am ashamed to beg .
42016004	I have come to know what I will do , so that they [ my master’s debtors ] may accept and welcome me into their houses when I am put out of the management .
42016005	So he summoned his master’s debtors one by one , and he said to the first , How much do you owe my master ?
42016006	He said , A hundred measures [ about 900 gallons ] of oil . And he said to him , Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation , and sit down quickly and write fifty [ about 450 gallons ] .
42016007	After that he said to another , And how much do you owe ? He said , A hundred measures [ about 900 bushels ] of wheat . He said to him , Take back your written acknowledgement of obligation , and write eighty [ about 700 bushels ] .
42016008	And [ his ] master praised the dishonest ( unjust ) manager for acting shrewdly and prudently ; for the sons of this age are shrewder and more prudent and wiser in [ relation to ] their own generation [ to their own age and kind ] than are the sons of light .
42016009	And I tell you , make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon ( deceitful riches , money , possessions ) , so that when it fails , they [ those you have favored ] may receive and welcome you into the everlasting habitations ( dwellings ) .
42016010	He who is faithful in a very little [ thing ] is faithful also in much , and he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little [ thing ] is dishonest and unjust also in much .
42016011	Therefore if you have not been faithful in the [ case of ] unrighteous mammon ( deceitful riches , money , possessions ) , who will entrust to you the true riches ?
42016012	And if you have not proved faithful in that which belongs to another [ whether God or man ] , who will give you that which is your own [ that is , the true riches ] ?
42016013	No servant is able to serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve God and mammon ( riches , or anything in which you trust and on which you rely ) .
42016014	Now the Pharisees , who were covetous and lovers of money , heard all these things [ taken together ] , and they began to sneer at and ridicule and scoff at Him .
42016015	But He said to them , You are the ones who declare yourselves just and upright before men , but God knows your hearts . For what is exalted and highly thought of among men is detestable and abhorrent ( an abomination ) in the sight of God .
42016016	Until John came , there were the Law and the Prophets ; since then the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom of God is being preached , and everyone strives violently to go in [ would force his own way rather than God’s way into it ] .
42016017	Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to fail and become void .
42016018	Whoever divorces ( dismisses and repudiates ) his wife and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery .
42016019	There was a certain rich man who [ habitually ] clothed himself in purple and fine linen and reveled and feasted and made merry in splendor every day .
42016020	And at his gate there was [ carelessly ] dropped down and left a certain utterly destitute man named Lazarus , [ reduced to begging alms and ] covered with [ ulcerated ] sores .
42016021	He [ eagerly ] desired to be satisfied with what fell from the rich man’s table ; moreover , the dogs even came and licked his sores .
42016022	And it occurred that the man [ reduced to ] begging died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s bosom . The rich man also died and was buried .
42016023	And in Hades ( the realm of the dead ) , being in torment , he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away , and Lazarus in his bosom .
42016024	And he cried out and said , Father Abraham , have pity and mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am in anguish in this flame .
42016025	But Abraham said , Child , remember that you in your lifetime fully received [ what is due you in ] comforts and delights , and Lazarus in like manner the discomforts and distresses ; but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish .
42016026	And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been fixed , in order that those who want to pass from this [ place ] to you may not be able , and no one may pass from there to us .
42016027	And [ the man ] said , Then , father , I beseech you to send him to my father’s house --
42016028	For I have five brothers -- so that he may give [ solemn ] testimony and warn them , lest they too come into this place of torment .
42016029	But Abraham said , They have Moses and the Prophets ; let them hear and listen to them .
42016030	But he answered , No , father Abraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent ( change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways , with abhorrence of their past sins ) .
42016031	He said to him , If they do not hear and listen to Moses and the Prophets , neither will they be persuaded and convinced and believe [ even ] if someone should rise from the dead .
42017001	AND [ Jesus ] said to His disciples , Temptations ( snares , traps set to entice to sin ) are sure to come , but woe to him by or through whom they come !
42017002	It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare to one of these little ones [ lowly in rank or influence ] .
42017003	Pay attention and always be on your guard [ looking out for one another ] . If your brother sins ( misses the mark ) , solemnly tell him so and reprove him , and if he repents ( feels sorry for having sinned ) , forgive him .
42017004	And even if he sins against you seven times in a day , and turns to you seven times and says , I repent [ I am sorry ] , you must forgive him ( give up resentment and consider the offense as recalled and annulled ) .
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , Increase our faith ( that trust and confidence that spring from our belief in God ) .
42017006	And the Lord answered , If you had faith ( trust and confidence in God ) even [ so small ] like a grain of mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , Be pulled up by the roots , and be planted in the sea , and it would obey you .
42017007	Will any man of you who has a servant plowing or tending sheep say to him when he has come in from the field , Come at once and take your place at the table ?
42017008	Will he not instead tell him , Get my supper ready and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink ; then afterward you yourself shall eat and drink ?
42017009	Is he grateful and does he praise the servant because he did what he was ordered to do ?
42017010	Even so on your part , when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you , say , We are unworthy servants [ possessing no merit , for we have not gone beyond our obligation ] ; we have [ merely ] done what was our duty to do .
42017011	As He went on His way to Jerusalem , it occurred that [ Jesus ] was passing [ along the border ] between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	And as He was going into one village , He was met by ten lepers , who stood at a distance .
42017013	And they raised up their voices and called , Jesus , Master , take pity and have mercy on us !
42017014	And when He saw them , He said to them , Go [ at once ] and show yourselves to the priests . And as they went , they were cured and made clean .
42017015	Then one of them , upon seeing that he was cured , turned back , recognizing and thanking and praising God with a loud voice ;
42017016	And he fell prostrate at Jesus’ feet , thanking Him [ over and over ] . And he was a Samaritan .
42017017	Then Jesus asked , Were not [ all ] ten cleansed ? Where are the nine ?
42017018	Was there no one found to return and to recognize and give thanks and praise to God except this alien ?
42017019	And He said to him , Get up and go on your way . Your faith ( your trust and confidence that spring from your belief in God ) has restored you to health .
42017020	Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , He replied to them by saying , The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed or with visible display ,
42017021	Nor will people say , Look ! Here [ it is ] ! or , See , [ it is ] there ! For behold , the kingdom of God is within you [ in your hearts ] and among you [ surrounding you ] .
42017022	And He said to the disciples , The time is coming when you will long to see [ even ] one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see [ it ] .
42017023	And they will say to you , Look ! [ He is ] there ! or , Look ! [ He is ] here ! But do not go out or follow [ them ] .
42017024	For like the lightning , that flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other , so will the Son of Man be in His [ own ] day .
42017025	But first He must suffer many things and be disapproved and repudiated and rejected by this age and generation .
42017026	And [ just ] as it was in the days of Noah , so will it be in the time of the Son of Man .
42017027	[ People ] ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , right up to the day when Noah went into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
42017028	So also [ it was the same ] as it was in the days of Lot . [ People ] ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
42017029	But on the [ very ] day that Lot went out of Sodom , it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [ them ] all .
42017030	That is the way it will be on the day that the Son of Man is revealed .
42017031	On that day let him who is on the housetop , with his belongings in the house , not come down [ and go inside ] to carry them away ; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back .
42017032	Remember Lot’s wife !
42017033	Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life will preserve and quicken it .
42017034	I tell you , in that night there will be two men in one bed ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
42017035	There will be two women grinding together ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
42017036	Two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
42017037	Then they asked Him , Where , Lord ? He said to them , Wherever the dead body is , there will the vultures or eagles be gathered together .
42018001	ALSO [ Jesus ] told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not to turn coward ( faint , lose heart , and give up ) .
42018002	He said , In a certain city there was a judge who neither reverenced and feared God nor respected or considered man .
42018003	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying , Protect and defend and give me justice against my adversary .
42018004	And for a time he would not ; but later he said to himself , Though I have neither reverence or fear for God nor respect or consideration for man ,
42018005	Yet because this widow continues to bother me , I will defend and protect and avenge her , lest she give me intolerable annoyance and wear me out by her continual coming or at the last she come and rail on me or assault me or strangle me .
42018006	Then the Lord said , Listen to what the unjust judge says !
42018007	And will not [ our just ] God defend and protect and avenge His elect ( His chosen ones ) , who cry to Him day and night ? Will He defer them and delay help on their behalf ?
42018008	I tell you , He will defend and protect and avenge them speedily . However , when the Son of Man comes , will He find [ persistence in ] faith on the earth ?
42018009	He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves and were confident that they were righteous [ that they were upright and in right standing with God ] and scorned and made nothing of all the rest of men :
42018010	Two men went up into the temple [ enclosure ] to pray , the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
42018011	The Pharisee took his stand ostentatiously and began to pray thus before and with himself : God , I thank You that I am not like the rest of men -- extortioners ( robbers ) , swindlers [ unrighteous in heart and life ] , adulterers -- or even like this tax collector here .
42018012	I fast twice a week ; I give tithes of all that I gain .
42018013	But the tax collector , [ merely ] standing at a distance , would not even lift up his eyes to heaven , but kept striking his breast , saying , O God , be favorable ( be gracious , be merciful ) to me , the especially wicked sinner that I am !
42018014	I tell you , this man went down to his home justified ( forgiven and made upright and in right standing with God ) , rather than the other man ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted .
42018015	Now they were also bringing [ even ] babies to Him that He might touch them , and when the disciples noticed it , they reproved them .
42018016	But Jesus called them [ the parents ] to Him , saying , Allow the little children to come to Me , and do not hinder them , for to such [ as these ] belongs the kingdom of God .
42018017	Truly I say to you , whoever does not accept and receive and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [ does ] shall not in any way enter it [ at all ] .
42018018	And a certain ruler asked Him , Good Teacher [ You who are essentially and perfectly morally good ] , what shall I do to inherit eternal life [ to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah’s kingdom ] ?
42018019	Jesus said to him , Why do you call Me [ essentially and perfectly morally ] good ? No one is [ essentially and perfectly morally ] good -- except God only .
42018020	You know the commandments : Do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not witness falsely , honor your father and your mother .
42018021	And he replied , All these I have kept from my youth .
42018022	And when Jesus heard it , He said to him , One thing you still lack . Sell everything that you have and divide [ the money ] among the poor , and you will have [ rich ] treasure in heaven ; and come back [ and ] follow Me [ become My disciple , join My party , and accompany Me ] .
42018023	But when he heard this , he became distressed and very sorrowful , for he was rich -- exceedingly so .
42018024	Jesus , observing him , said , How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God !
42018025	For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle’s eye than [ for ] a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .
42018026	And those who heard it said , Then who can be saved ?
42018027	But He said , What is impossible with men is possible with God .
42018028	And Peter said , See , we have left our own [ things -- home , family , and business ] and have followed You .
42018029	And He said to them , I say to you truly , there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
42018030	Who will not receive in return many times more in this world and , in the coming age , eternal life .
42018031	Then taking the Twelve [ apostles ] aside , He said to them , Listen ! We are going up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written about the Son of Man through and by the prophets will be fulfilled .
42018032	For He will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be made sport of and scoffed and jeered at and insulted and spit upon .
42018033	They will flog Him and kill Him ; and on the third day He will rise again .
42018034	But they understood nothing of these things ; His words were a mystery and hidden from them , and they did not comprehend what He was telling them .
42018035	As He came near to Jericho , it occurred that a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
42018036	And hearing a crowd going by , he asked what it meant .
42018037	They told him , Jesus of Nazareth is passing by .
42018038	And he shouted , saying , Jesus , Son of David , take pity and have mercy on me !
42018039	But those who were in front reproved him , telling him to keep quiet ; yet he screamed and shrieked so much the more , Son of David , take pity and have mercy on me !
42018040	Then Jesus stood still and ordered that he be led to Him ; and when he came near , Jesus asked him ,
42018041	What do you want Me to do for you ? He said , Lord , let me receive my sight !
42018042	And Jesus said to him , Receive your sight ! Your faith ( your trust and confidence that spring from your faith in God ) has healed you .
42018043	And instantly he received his sight and began to follow Jesus , recognizing , praising , and honoring God ; and all the people , when they saw it , praised God .
42019001	AND [ Jesus ] entered Jericho and was passing through it .
42019002	And there was a man called Zacchaeus , a chief tax collector , and [ he was ] rich .
42019003	And he was trying to see Jesus , which One He was , but he could not on account of the crowd , because he was small in stature .
42019004	So he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him , for He was about to pass that way .
42019005	And when Jesus reached the place , He looked up and said to him , Zacchaeus , hurry and come down ; for I must stay at your house today .
42019006	So he hurried and came down , and he received and welcomed Him joyfully .
42019007	And when the people saw it , they all muttered among themselves and indignantly complained , He has gone in to be the guest of and lodge with a man who is devoted to sin and preeminently a sinner .
42019008	So then Zacchaeus stood up and solemnly declared to the Lord , See , Lord , the half of my goods I [ now ] give [ by way of restoration ] to the poor , and if I have cheated anyone out of anything , I [ now ] restore four times as much .
42019009	And Jesus said to him , Today is [ Messianic and spiritual ] salvation come to [ all the members of ] this household , since Zacchaeus too is a [ real spiritual ] son of Abraham ;
42019010	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost .
42019011	Now as they were listening to these things , He proceeded to tell a parable , because He was approaching Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be brought to light and shown forth immediately .
42019012	He therefore said , A certain nobleman went into a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom and then to return .
42019013	Calling ten of his [ own ] bond servants , he gave them ten minas [ each equal to about one hundred days’ wages or nearly twenty dollars ] and said to them , Buy and sell with these while I go and then return .
42019014	But his citizens detested him and sent an embassy after him to say , We do not want this man to become ruler over us .
42019015	When he returned after having received the kingdom , he ordered these bond servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him , that he might know how much each one had made by buying and selling .
42019016	The first one came before him , and he said , Lord , your mina has made ten [ additional ] minas .
42019017	And he said to him , Well done , excellent bond servant ! Because you have been faithful and trustworthy in a very little [ thing ] , you shall have authority over ten cities .
42019018	The second one also came and said , Lord , your mina has made five more minas .
42019019	And he said also to him , And you will take charge over five cities .
42019020	Then another came and said , Lord , here is your mina , which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief .
42019021	For I was [ constantly ] afraid of you , because you are a stern ( hard , severe ) man ; you pick up what you did not lay down , and you reap what you did not sow .
42019022	He said to the servant , I will judge and condemn you out of your own mouth , you wicked slave ! You knew [ did you ] that I was a stern ( hard , severe ) man , picking up what I did not lay down , and reaping what I did not sow ?
42019023	Then why did you not put my money in a bank , so that on my return , I might have collected it with interest ?
42019024	And he said to the bystanders , Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas .
42019025	And they said to him , Lord , he has ten minas [ already ] !
42019026	And [ said Jesus , ] I tell you that to everyone who gets and has will more be given , but from the man who does not get and does not have , even what he has will be taken away .
42019027	[ The indignant king ended by saying ] But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them -- bring them here and slaughter them in my presence !
42019028	And after saying these things , Jesus went on ahead of them , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	When He came near Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called [ the Mount of ] Olives , He sent two of His disciples ,
42019030	Telling [ them ] , Go into the village yonder ; there , as you go in , you will find a donkey’s colt tied , on which no man has ever yet sat . Loose it and bring [ it here ] .
42019031	If anybody asks you , Why are you untying [ it ] ? you shall say this : Because the Lord has need of it .
42019032	So those who were sent went away and found it [ just ] as He had told them .
42019033	And as they were loosening the colt , its owners said to them , Why are you untying the colt ?
42019034	And they said , The Lord has need of it .
42019035	And they brought it to Jesus ; then they threw their garments over the colt and set Jesus upon it .
42019036	And as He rode along , the people kept spreading their garments on the road .
42019037	As He was approaching [ the city ] , at the descent of the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God [ extolling Him exultantly and ] loudly for all the mighty miracles and works of power that they had witnessed ,
42019038	Crying , Blessed ( celebrated with praises ) is the King Who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven [ freedom there from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ] and glory ( majesty and splendor ) in the highest [ heaven ] !
42019039	And some of the Pharisees from the throng said to Jesus , Teacher , reprove Your disciples !
42019040	He replied , I tell you that if these keep silent , the very stones will cry out .
42019041	And as He approached , He saw the city , and He wept [ audibly ] over it ,
42019042	Exclaiming , Would that you had known personally , even at least in this your day , the things that make for peace ( for freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin and upon which your peace -- your security , safety , prosperity , and happiness -- depends ) ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
42019043	For a time is coming upon you when your enemies will throw up a bank [ with pointed stakes ] about you and surround you and shut you in on every side .
42019044	And they will dash you down to the ground , you [ Jerusalem ] and your children within you ; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another , [ all ] because you did not come progressively to recognize and know and understand [ from observation and experience ] the time of your visitation [ that is , when God was visiting you , the time in which God showed Himself gracious toward you and offered you salvation through Christ ] .
42019045	Then He went into the temple [ enclosure ] and began to drive out those who were selling ,
42019046	Telling them , It is written , My house shall be a house of prayer ; but you have made it a cave of robbers .
42019047	And He continued to teach day after day in the temple [ porches and courts ] . The chief priests and scribes and the leading men of the people were seeking to put Him to death ,
42019048	But they did not discover anything they could do , for all the people hung upon His words and stuck by Him .
42020001	ONE DAY as Jesus was instructing the people in the temple [ porches ] and preaching the good news ( the Gospel ) , the chief priests and the scribes came up with the elders ( members of the Sanhedrin )
42020002	And said to Him , Tell us by what [ sort of ] authority You are doing these things ? Or who is it who gave You this authority ?
42020003	He replied to them , I will also ask you a question . Now answer Me :
42020004	Was the baptism of John from heaven , or from men ?
42020005	And they argued and discussed [ it ] and reasoned together with themselves , saying , If we reply , From heaven , He will say , Why then did you not believe him ?
42020006	But if we answer , From men , all the people will stone us to death , for they are long since firmly convinced that John was a prophet .
42020007	So they replied that they did not know from where it came .
42020008	Then Jesus said to them , Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
42020009	Then He began to relate to the people this parable ( this story to figuratively portray what He had to say ) : A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some vinedressers and went into another country for a long stay .
42020010	When the [ right ] season came , he sent a bond servant to the tenants , that they might give him [ his part ] of the fruit of the vineyard ; but the tenants beat ( thrashed ) him and sent him away empty-handed .
42020011	And he sent still another servant ; him they also beat ( thrashed ) and dishonored and insulted him disgracefully and sent him away empty-handed .
42020012	And he sent yet a third ; this one they wounded and threw out [ of the vineyard ] .
42020013	Then the owner of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; it is probable that they will respect him .
42020014	But when the tenants saw him , they argued among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; let us kill him , so that the inheritance may be ours .
42020015	So they drove him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
42020016	He will come and [ utterly ] put an end to those tenants and will give the vineyard to others . When they [ the chief priests and the scribes and the elders ] heard this , they said , May it never be !
42020017	But [ Jesus ] looked at them and said , What then is [ the meaning of ] this that is written : The [ very ] Stone which the builders rejected has become the chief Stone of the corner [ Cornerstone ] ?
42020018	Everyone who falls on that Stone will be broken [ in pieces ] ; but upon whomever It falls , It will crush him [ winnow him and scatter him as dust ] .
42020019	The scribes and the chief priests desired and tried to find a way to arrest Him at that very hour , but they were afraid of the people ; for they discerned that He had related this parable against them .
42020020	So they watched [ for an opportunity to ensnare ] Him , and sent spies who pretended to be upright ( honest and sincere ) , that they might lay hold of something He might say , so as to turn Him over to the control and authority of the governor .
42020021	They asked Him , Teacher , we know that You speak and teach what is right , and that You show no partiality to anyone but teach the way of God honestly and in truth .
42020022	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not ?
42020023	But He recognized and understood their cunning and unscrupulousness and said to them ,
42020024	Show Me a denarius ( a coin ) ! Whose image and inscription does it have ? They answered , Caesar’s .
42020025	He said to them , Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s , and to God the things that are God’s .
42020026	So they could not in the presence of the people take hold of anything He said to turn it against Him ; but marveling at His reply , they were silent .
42020027	Also there came to Him some Sadducees , those who say that there is no resurrection .
42020028	And they asked Him a question , saying , Teacher , Moses wrote for us [ a law ] that if a man’s brother dies , leaving a wife and no children , the man shall take the woman and raise up offspring for his brother .
42020029	Now there were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife and died without [ having any ] children .
42020030	And the second
42020031	And then the third took her , and in like manner all seven , and they died , leaving no children .
42020032	Last of all , the woman died also .
42020033	Now in the resurrection whose wife will the woman be ? For the seven married her .
42020034	And Jesus said to them , The people of this world and present age marry and are given in marriage ;
42020035	But those who are considered worthy to gain that other world and that future age and to attain to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
42020036	For they cannot die again , but they are angel-like and equal to angels . And being sons of and sharers in the resurrection , they are sons of God .
42020037	But that the dead are raised [ from death ] -- even Moses made known and showed in the passage concerning the [ burning ] bush , where he calls the Lord , The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
42020038	Now He is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for to Him all men are alive [ whether in the body or out of it ] and they are alive [ not dead ] unto Him [ in definite relationship to Him ] .
42020039	And some of the scribes replied , Teacher , you have spoken well and expertly [ so that there is no room for blame ] .
42020040	For they did not dare to question Him further .
42020041	But He asked them , How can people say that the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) is David’s Son ?
42020042	For David himself says in [ the ] Book of Psalms , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at My right hand
42020043	Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet .
42020044	So David calls Him Lord ; how then is He his Son ?
42020045	And with all the people listening , He said to His disciples ,
42020046	Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes and love to be saluted [ with honor ] in places where people congregate and love the front and best seats in the synagogues and places of distinction at feasts ,
42020047	Who make away with and devour widows’ houses , and [ to cover it up ] with pretense make long prayers . They will receive the greater condemnation ( the heavier sentence , the severer punishment ) .
42021001	LOOKING UP , [ Jesus ] saw the rich people putting their gifts into the treasury .
42021002	And He saw also a poor widow putting in two mites ( copper coins ) .
42021003	And He said , Truly I say to you , this poor widow has put in more than all of them ;
42021004	For they all gave out of their abundance ( their surplus ) ; but she has contributed out of her lack and her want , putting in all that she had on which to live .
42021005	And as some were saying of the temple that it was decorated with handsome ( shapely and magnificent ) stones and consecrated offerings [ laid up to be kept ] , He said ,
42021006	As for all this that you [ thoughtfully ] look at , the time will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down .
42021007	And they asked Him , Teacher , when will this happen ? And what sign will there be when this is about to occur ?
42021008	And He said , Be on your guard and be careful that you are not led astray ; for many will come in My name [ appropriating to themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me ] , saying , I am He ! and , The time is at hand ! Do not go out after them .
42021009	And when you hear of wars and insurrections ( disturbances , disorder , and confusion ) , do not become alarmed and panic-stricken and terrified ; for all this must take place first , but the end will not [ come ] immediately .
42021010	Then He told them , Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
42021011	There will be mighty and violent earthquakes , and in various places famines and pestilences ( plagues : malignant and contagious or infectious epidemic diseases which are deadly and devastating ) ; and there will be sights of terror and great signs from heaven .
42021012	But previous to all this , they will lay their hands on you and persecute you , turning you over to the synagogues and prisons , and you will be led away before kings and governors for My name’s sake .
42021013	This will be a time ( an opportunity ) for you to bear testimony .
42021014	Resolve and settle it in your minds not to meditate and prepare beforehand how you are to make your defense and how you will answer .
42021015	For I [ Myself ] will give you a mouth and such utterance and wisdom that all of your foes combined will be unable to stand against or refute .
42021016	You will be delivered up and betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends , and [ some ] of you they will put to death .
42021017	And you will be hated ( despised ) by everyone because [ you bear ] My name and for its sake .
42021018	But not a hair of your head shall perish .
42021019	By your steadfastness and patient endurance you shall win the true life of your souls .
42021020	But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then know and understand that its desolation has come near .
42021021	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains , and let those who are inside [ the city ] get out of it , and let not those who are out in the country come into it ;
42021022	For those are days of vengeance [ of rendering full justice or satisfaction ] , that all things that are written may be fulfilled .
42021023	Alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have babies which they are nursing in those days ! For great misery and anguish and distress shall be upon the land and indignation and punishment and retribution upon this people .
42021024	They will fall by the mouth and the edge of the sword and will be led away as captives to and among all nations ; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled ( completed ) .
42021025	And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars ; and upon the earth [ there will be ] distress ( trouble and anguish ) of nations in bewilderment and perplexity [ without resources , left wanting , embarrassed , in doubt , not knowing which way to turn ] at the roaring ( the echo ) of the tossing of the sea ,
42021026	Men swooning away or expiring with fear and dread and apprehension and expectation of the things that are coming on the world ; for the [ very ] powers of the heavens will be shaken and caused to totter .
42021027	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great ( transcendent and overwhelming ) power and [ all His kingly ] glory ( majesty and splendor ) .
42021028	Now when these things begin to occur , look up and lift up your heads , because your redemption ( deliverance ) is drawing near .
42021029	And He told them a parable : Look at the fig tree and all the trees ;
42021030	When they put forth their buds and come out in leaf , you see for yourselves and perceive and know that summer is already near .
42021031	Even so , when you see these things taking place , understand and know that the kingdom of God is at hand .
42021032	Truly I tell you , this generation ( those living at that definite period of time ) will not perish and pass away until all has taken place .
42021033	The sky and the earth ( the universe , the world ) will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
42021034	But take heed to yourselves and be on your guard , lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed ( weighed down ) with the giddiness and headache and nausea of self-indulgence , drunkenness , and worldly worries and cares pertaining to [ the business of ] this life , and [ lest ] that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose ;
42021035	For it will come upon all who live upon the face of the entire earth .
42021036	Keep awake then and watch at all times [ be discreet , attentive , and ready ] , praying that you may have the full strength and ability and be accounted worthy to escape all these things [ taken together ] that will take place , and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man .
42021037	Now in the daytime Jesus was teaching in [ the porches and courts of ] the temple , but at night He would go out and stay on the mount called Olivet .
42021038	And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple [ porches or courts ] to listen to Him .
42022001	NOW THE Festival of Unleavened Bread was drawing near , which is called the Passover .
42022002	And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to do away with [ Jesus ] , for they feared the people .
42022003	But [ then ] Satan entered into Judas , called Iscariot , who was one of the Twelve [ apostles ] .
42022004	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him and deliver Him up to them .
42022005	And they were delighted and pledged [ themselves ] to give him money .
42022006	So he agreed [ to this ] , and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them [ without an uprising ] in the absence of the throng .
42022007	Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [ lamb ] had to be slain .
42022008	So Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare for us the Passover meal , that we may eat it .
42022009	They said to Him , Where do You want us to prepare [ it ] ?
42022010	He said to them , Behold , when you have gone into the city , a man carrying an earthen jug or pitcher of water will meet you ; follow him into the house which he enters ,
42022011	And say to the master of the house , The Teacher asks you , Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover [ meal ] with My disciples ?
42022012	And he will show you a large room upstairs , furnished [ with carpets and with couches properly spread ] ; there make [ your ] preparations .
42022013	And they went and found it [ just ] as He had said to them ; and they made ready the Passover [ supper ] .
42022014	And when the hour came , [ Jesus ] reclined at table , and the apostles with Him .
42022015	And He said to them , I have earnestly and intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ;
42022016	For I say to you , I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
42022017	And He took a cup , and when He had given thanks , He said , Take this and divide and distribute it among yourselves ;
42022018	For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes .
42022019	Then He took a loaf [ of bread ] , and when He had given thanks , He broke [ it ] and gave it to them saying , This is My body which is given for you ; do this in remembrance of Me .
42022020	And in like manner , He took the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament or covenant [ ratified ] in My blood , which is shed ( poured out ) for you .
42022021	But , behold , the hand of him who is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table .
42022022	For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined and appointed , but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed and delivered up !
42022023	And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who was about to do this .
42022024	Now an eager contention arose among them [ as to ] which of them was considered and reputed to be the greatest .
42022025	But Jesus said to them , The kings of the Gentiles are deified by them and exercise lordship [ ruling as emperor-gods ] over them ; and those in authority over them are called benefactors and well-doers .
42022026	But this is not to be so with you ; on the contrary , let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest , and him who is the chief and leader like one who serves .
42022027	For who is the greater , the one who reclines at table ( the master ) , or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines at table ? But I am in your midst as One Who serves .
42022028	And you are those who have remained [ throughout ] and persevered with Me in My trials ;
42022029	And as My Father has appointed a kingdom and conferred it on Me , so do I confer on you [ the privilege and decree ] ,
42022030	That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	Simon , Simon ( Peter ) , listen ! Satan has asked excessively that [ all of ] you be given up to him [ out of the power and keeping of God ] , that he might sift [ all of ] you like grain ,
42022032	But I have prayed especially for you [ Peter ] , that your [ own ] faith may not fail ; and when you yourself have turned again , strengthen and establish your brethren .
42022033	And [ Simon Peter ] said to Him , Lord , I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death .
42022034	But Jesus said , I tell you , Peter , before a [ single ] cock shall crow this day , you will three times [ utterly ] deny that you know Me .
42022035	And He said to them , When I sent you out with no purse or [ provision ] bag or sandals , did you lack anything ? They answered , Nothing !
42022036	Then He said to them , But now let him who has a purse take it , and also [ his provision ] bag ; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword .
42022037	For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me : And He was counted and classed among the wicked ( the outlaws , the criminals ) ; for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [ has reached its end and is finally settled ] .
42022038	And they said , Look , Lord ! Here are two swords . And He said to them , It is enough .
42022039	And He came out and went , as was His habit , to the Mount of Olives , and the disciples also followed Him .
42022040	And when He came to the place , He said to them , Pray that you may not [ at all ] enter into temptation .
42022041	And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw and knelt down and prayed ,
42022042	Saying , Father , if You are willing , remove this cup from Me ; yet not My will , but [ always ] Yours be done .
42022043	And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven , strengthening Him in spirit .
42022044	And being in an agony [ of mind ] , He prayed [ all the ] more earnestly and intently , and His sweat became like great clots of blood dropping down upon the ground .
42022045	And when He got up from prayer , He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from grief ,
42022046	And He said to them , Why do you sleep ? Get up and pray that you may not enter [ at all ] into temptation .
42022047	And while He was still speaking , behold , there came a crowd , and the man called Judas , one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , was going before [ leading ] them . He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him ,
42022048	But Jesus said to him , Judas ! Would you betray and deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss ?
42022049	And when those who were around Him saw what was about to happen , they said , Lord , shall we strike with the sword ?
42022050	And one of them struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear , the right one .
42022051	But Jesus said , Permit them to go so far [ as to seize Me ] . And He touched the little ( insignificant ) ear and healed him .
42022052	Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him -- the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [ of the Sanhedrin ] -- Have you come out with swords and clubs as [ you would ] against a robber ?
42022053	When I was with you day after day in the temple [ enclosure ] , you did not stretch forth [ your ] hands against Me . But this is your hour -- and the power [ which ] darkness [ gives you has its way ] .
42022054	Then they seized Him and led Him away , bringing Him into the house of the high priest . Peter was following at a distance .
42022055	And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were seated together , Peter sat among them .
42022056	Then a servant girl , seeing him as he sat in the firelight and gazing [ intently ] at him , said , This man too was with Him .
42022057	But he denied it and said , Woman , I do not know Him !
42022058	And a little later someone else saw him and said , You are one of them also . But Peter said , Man , I am not !
42022059	And when about an hour more had elapsed , still another emphatically insisted , It is the truth that this man also was with Him , for he too is a Galilean !
42022060	But Peter said , Man , I do not know what you are talking about . And instantly , while he was still speaking , the cock crowed .
42022061	And the Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter recalled the Lord’s words , how He had told him , Before the cock crows today , you will deny Me thrice .
42022062	And he went out and wept bitterly [ that is , with painfully moving grief ] .
42022063	Now the men who had Jesus in custody treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him and beat Him ;
42022064	They blindfolded Him also and asked Him , Prophesy ! Who is it that struck You ?
42022065	And they said many other evil and slanderous and insulting words against Him , reviling Him .
42022066	As soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together , both chief priests and scribes ; and they led Him into their council ( the Sanhedrin ) , and they said ,
42022067	If You are the Christ ( the Messiah ) , tell us . But He said to them , If I tell you , you will not believe ( trust in , cleave to , and rely on what I say ) ,
42022068	And if I question you , you will not answer .
42022069	But hereafter ( from this time on ) , the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God .
42022070	And they all said , You are the Son of God , then ? And He said to them , It is just as you say ; I AM .
42022071	And they said , What further evidence do we need ? For we have heard [ it ] ourselves from His own mouth !
42023001	THEN THE whole assembly of them got up and conducted [ Jesus ] before Pilate .
42023002	And they began to accuse Him , asserting , We found this Man perverting ( misleading , corrupting , and turning away ) our nation and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar , saying that He Himself is Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) , a King !
42023003	So Pilate asked Him , Are You the King of the Jews ? And He answered him , [ It is just as ] you say . [ I AM . ]
42023004	And Pilate said to the chief priests and the throngs , I find no guilt or crime in this Man .
42023005	But they were urgent and emphatic , saying , He stirs up and excites the people , teaching throughout all Judea -- from Galilee , where He began , even to this place .
42023006	Upon hearing this , Pilate asked whether the Man was a Galilean .
42023007	And when he found out [ certainly ] that He belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction , he sent Him up to Herod [ a higher authority ] , who was also in Jerusalem in those days .
42023008	Now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had eagerly desired to see Him for a long time because of what he had heard concerning Him , and he was hoping to witness some sign ( some striking evidence or spectacular performance ) done by Him .
42023009	So he asked Him many questions , but He made no reply .
42023010	Meanwhile , the chief priests and the scribes stood by , continuing vehemently and violently to accuse Him .
42023011	And Herod , with his soldiers , treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him ; then , dressing Him up in bright and gorgeous apparel , he sent Him back to Pilate .
42023012	And that very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other -- [ though ] they had been at enmity before this .
42023013	Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
42023014	And said to them , You brought this Man before me as One Who was perverting and misleading and turning away and corrupting the people ; and behold , after examining Him before you , I have not found any offense ( crime or guilt ) in this Man in regard to your accusations against Him ;
42023015	No , nor indeed did Herod , for he sent Him back to us ; behold , He has done nothing deserving of death .
42023016	I will therefore chastise Him and deliver Him amended ( reformed , taught His lesson ) and release Him .
42023017	For it was necessary for him to release to them one prisoner at the Feast .
42023018	But they all together raised a deep cry [ from the depths of their throats ] , saying , Away with this Man ! Release to us Barabbas !
42023019	He was a man who had been thrown into prison for raising a riot in the city , and for murder .
42023020	Once more Pilate called to them , wishing to release Jesus ;
42023021	But they kept shouting out , Crucify , crucify Him !
42023022	A third time he said to them , Why ? What wrong has He done ? I have found [ no offense or crime or guilt ] in Him nothing deserving of death ; I will therefore chastise Him [ in order to teach Him better ] and release Him .
42023023	But they were insistent and urgent , demanding with loud cries that He should be crucified . And their voices prevailed ( accomplished their purpose ) .
42023024	And Pilate gave sentence , that what they asked should be done .
42023025	So he released the man who had been thrown into prison for riot and murder , for whom they continued to ask , but Jesus he delivered up to be done with as they willed .
42023026	And as they led Him away , they seized one Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country , and laid on him the cross and made him carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	And there accompanied [ Jesus ] a great multitude of the people , [ including ] women who bewailed and lamented Him .
42023028	But Jesus , turning toward them , said , Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	For behold , the days are coming during which they will say , Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and to be envied ) are the barren , and the wombs that have not borne , and the breasts that have never nursed [ babies ] !
42023030	Then they will begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ! and to the hills , Cover ( conceal , hide ) us !
42023031	For if they do these things when the timber is green , what will happen when it is dry ?
42023032	Two others also , who were criminals , were led away to be executed with Him .
42023033	And when they came to the place which is called The Skull [ Latin : Calvary ; Hebrew : Golgotha ] , there they crucified Him , and [ along with ] the criminals , one on the right and one on the left .
42023034	And Jesus prayed , Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . And they divided His garments and distributed them by casting lots for them .
42023035	Now the people stood by [ calmly and leisurely ] watching ; but the rulers scoffed and sneered ( turned up their noses ) at Him , saying , He rescued others [ from death ] ; let Him now rescue Himself , if He is the Christ ( the Messiah ) of God , His Chosen One !
42023036	The soldiers also ridiculed and made sport of Him , coming up and offering Him vinegar ( a sour wine mixed with water )
42023037	And saying , If you are the King of the Jews , save ( rescue ) Yourself [ from death ] .
42023038	For there was also an inscription above Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew : This is the King of the Jews .
42023039	One of the criminals who was suspended kept up a railing at Him , saying , Are You not the Christ ( the Messiah ) ? Rescue Yourself and us [ from death ] !
42023040	But the other one reproved him , saying , Do you not even fear God , seeing you yourself are under the same sentence of condemnation and suffering the same penalty ?
42023041	And we indeed suffer it justly , receiving the due reward of our actions ; but this Man has done nothing out of the way [ nothing strange or eccentric or perverse or unreasonable ] .
42023042	Then he said to Jesus , Lord , remember me when You come in Your kingly glory !
42023043	And He answered him , Truly I tell you , today you shall be with Me in Paradise .
42023044	It was now about the sixth hour ( midday ) , and darkness enveloped the whole land and earth until the ninth hour ( about three o’clock in the afternoon ) ,
42023045	While the sun’s light faded or was darkened ; and the curtain [ of the Holy of Holies ] of the temple was torn in two .
42023046	And Jesus , crying out with a loud voice , said , Father , into Your hands I commit My spirit ! And with these words , He expired .
42023047	Now the centurion , having seen what had taken place , recognized God and thanked and praised Him , and said , Indeed , without question , this Man was upright ( just and innocent ) !
42023048	And all the throngs that had gathered to see this spectacle , when they saw what had taken place , returned to their homes , beating their breasts .
42023049	And all the acquaintances of [ Jesus ] and the women who had followed Him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched these things .
42023050	Now notice , there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea . He was a member of the council ( the Sanhedrin ) , and a good ( upright , advantageous ) man , and righteous ( in right standing with God and man ) ,
42023051	Who had not agreed with or assented to the purpose and action of the others ; and he was expecting and waiting for the kingdom of God .
42023052	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
42023053	Then he took it down and rolled it up in a linen cloth for swathing dead bodies and laid Him in a rock-hewn tomb , where no one had ever yet been laid .
42023054	It was the day of Preparation [ for the Sabbath ] , and the Sabbath was dawning ( approaching ) .
42023055	The women who had come with [ Jesus ] from Galilee followed closely and saw the tomb and how His body was laid .
42023056	Then they went back and made ready spices and ointments ( perfumes ) . On the Sabbath day they rested in accordance with the commandment .
42024001	BUT ON the first day of the week , at early dawn , [ the women ] went to the tomb , taking the spices which they had made ready .
42024002	And they found the stone rolled back from the tomb ,
42024003	But when they went inside , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
42024004	And while they were perplexed and wondering what to do about this , behold , two men in dazzling raiment suddenly stood beside them .
42024005	And as [ the women ] were frightened and were bowing their faces to the ground , the men said to them , Why do you look for the living among [ those who are ] dead ?
42024006	He is not here , but has risen ! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee
42024007	That the Son of Man must be given over into the hands of sinful men ( men whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God ) and be crucified and on the third day rise [ from death ] .
42024008	And they remembered His words .
42024009	And having returned from the tomb , they reported all these things [ taken together ] to the eleven apostles and to all the rest .
42024010	Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them , who reported these things to the apostles .
42024011	But these reports seemed to the men an idle tale ( madness , feigned things , nonsense ) , and they did not believe the women .
42024012	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb ; and stooping down and looking in , he saw the linen cloths alone by themselves , and he went away , wondering about and marveling at what had happened .
42024013	And behold , that very day two of [ the disciples ] were going to a village called Emmaus , [ which is ] about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	And they were talking with each other about all these things that had occurred .
42024015	And while they were conversing and discussing together , Jesus Himself caught up with them and was already accompanying them .
42024016	But their eyes were held , so that they did not recognize Him .
42024017	And He said to them , What is this discussion that you are exchanging ( throwing back and forth ) between yourselves as you walk along ? And they stood still , looking sad and downcast .
42024018	Then one of them , named Cleopas , answered Him , Do you alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things that have occurred there in these days ?
42024019	And He said to them , What [ kind of ] things ? And they said to Him , About Jesus of Nazareth , Who was a Prophet mighty in work and word before God and all the people --
42024020	And how our chief priests and rulers gave Him up to be sentenced to death , and crucified Him .
42024021	But we were hoping that it was He Who would redeem and set Israel free . Yes , and besides all this , it is now the third day since these things occurred .
42024022	And moreover , some women of our company astounded us and drove us out of our senses . They were at the tomb early [ in the morning ]
42024023	But did not find His body ; and they returned saying that they had [ even ] seen a vision of angels , who said that He was alive !
42024024	So some of those [ who were ] with us went to the tomb and they found it just as the women had said , but Him they did not see .
42024025	And [ Jesus ] said to them , O foolish ones [ sluggish in mind , dull of perception ] and slow of heart to believe ( adhere to and trust in and rely on ) everything that the prophets have spoken !
42024026	Was it not necessary and essentially fitting that the Christ ( the Messiah ) should suffer all these things before entering into His glory ( His majesty and splendor ) ?
42024027	Then beginning with Moses and [ throughout ] all the Prophets , He went on explaining and interpreting to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning and referring to Himself .
42024028	Then they drew near the village to which they were going , and He acted as if He would go further .
42024029	But they urged and insisted , saying to Him , Remain with us , for it is toward evening , and the day is now far spent . So He went in to stay with them .
42024030	And it occurred that as He reclined at table with them , He took [ a loaf of ] bread and praised [ God ] and gave thanks and asked a blessing , and then broke it and was giving it to them
42024031	When their eyes were [ instantly ] opened and they [ clearly ] recognized Him , and He vanished ( departed invisibly ) .
42024032	And they said to one another , Were not our hearts greatly moved and burning within us while He was talking with us on the road and as He opened and explained to us [ the sense of ] the Scriptures ?
42024033	And rising up that very hour , they went back to Jerusalem , where they found the Eleven [ apostles ] gathered together and those who were with them ,
42024034	Who said , The Lord really has risen and has appeared to Simon ( Peter ) !
42024035	Then they [ themselves ] related [ in full ] what had happened on the road , and how He was known and recognized by them in the breaking of bread .
42024036	Now while they were talking about this , Jesus Himself took His stand among them and said to them , Peace ( freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ) be to you !
42024037	But they were so startled and terrified that they thought they saw a spirit .
42024038	And He said to them , Why are you disturbed and troubled , and why do such doubts and questionings arise in your hearts ?
42024039	See My hands and My feet , that it is I Myself ! Feel and handle Me and see , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones , as you see that I have .
42024040	And when He had said this , He showed them His hands and His feet .
42024041	And while [ since ] they still could not believe it for sheer joy and marveled , He said to them , Have you anything here to eat ?
42024042	They gave Him a piece of broiled fish ,
42024043	And He took [ it ] and ate [ it ] before them .
42024044	Then He said to them , This is what I told you while I was still with you : everything which is written concerning Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled .
42024045	Then He [ thoroughly ] opened up their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
42024046	And said to them , Thus it is written that the Christ ( the Messiah ) should suffer and on the third day rise from ( among ) the dead ,
42024047	And that repentance [ with a view to and as the condition of ] forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And behold , I will send forth upon you what My Father has promised ; but remain in the city [ Jerusalem ] until you are clothed with power from on high .
42024050	Then He conducted them out as far as Bethany , and , lifting up His hands , He invoked a blessing on them .
42024051	And it occurred that while He was blessing them , He parted from them and was taken up into heaven .
42024052	And they , worshiping Him , went back to Jerusalem with great joy ;
42024053	And they were continually in the temple celebrating with praises and blessing and extolling God . Amen ( so be it ) .
43001001	IN THE beginning [ before all time ] was the Word ( Christ ) , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God Himself .
43001002	He was present originally with God .
43001003	All things were made and came into existence through Him ; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being .
43001004	In Him was Life , and the Life was the Light of men .
43001005	And the Light shines on in the darkness , for the darkness has never overpowered it [ put it out or absorbed it or appropriated it , and is unreceptive to it ] .
43001006	There came a man sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	This man came to witness , that he might testify of the Light , that all men might believe in it [ adhere to it , trust it , and rely upon it ] through him .
43001008	He was not the Light himself , but came that he might bear witness regarding the Light .
43001009	There it was -- the true Light [ was then ] coming into the world [ the genuine , perfect , steadfast Light ] that illumines every person .
43001010	He came into the world , and though the world was made through Him , the world did not recognize Him [ did not know Him ] .
43001011	He came to that which belonged to Him [ to His own -- His domain , creation , things , world ] , and they who were His own did not receive Him and did not welcome Him .
43001012	But to as many as did receive and welcome Him , He gave the authority ( power , privilege , right ) to become the children of God , that is , to those who believe in ( adhere to , trust in , and rely on ) His name --
43001013	Who owe their birth neither to bloods nor to the will of the flesh [ that of physical impulse ] nor to the will of man [ that of a natural father ] , but to God . [ They are born of God ! ]
43001014	And the Word ( Christ ) became flesh ( human , incarnate ) and tabernacled ( fixed His tent of flesh , lived awhile ) among us ; and we [ actually ] saw His glory ( His honor , His majesty ) , such glory as an only begotten son receives from his father , full of grace ( favor , loving-kindness ) and truth .
43001015	John testified about Him and cried out , This was He of Whom I said , He Who comes after me has priority over me , for He was before me . [ He takes rank above me , for He existed before I did . He has advanced before me , because He is my Chief . ]
43001016	For out of His fullness ( abundance ) we have all received [ all had a share and we were all supplied with ] one grace after another and spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing and even favor upon favor and gift [ heaped ] upon gift .
43001017	For while the Law was given through Moses , grace ( unearned , undeserved favor and spiritual blessing ) and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No man has ever seen God at any time ; the only unique Son , or the only begotten God , Who is in the bosom [ in the intimate presence ] of the Father , He has declared Him [ He has revealed Him and brought Him out where He can be seen ; He has interpreted Him and He has made Him known ] .
43001019	And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him , Who are you ?
43001020	He confessed ( admitted the truth ) and did not try to conceal it , but acknowledged , I am not the Christ !
43001021	They asked him , What then ? Are you Elijah ? And he said , I am not ! Are you the Prophet ? And he answered , No !
43001022	Then they said to him , Who are you ? Tell us , so that we may give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ?
43001023	He said , I am the voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness [ the voice of one shouting in the desert ] , Prepare the way of the Lord [ level , straighten out , the path of the Lord ] , as the prophet Isaiah said .
43001024	The messengers had been sent from the Pharisees .
43001025	And they asked him , Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ?
43001026	John answered them , I [ only ] baptize in ( with ) water . Among you there stands One Whom you do not recognize and with Whom you are not acquainted and of Whom you know nothing .
43001027	It is He Who , coming after me , is preferred before me , the string of Whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose .
43001028	These things occurred in Bethany ( Bethabara ) across the Jordan [ at the Jordan crossing ] , where John was then baptizing .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and said , Look ! There is the Lamb of God , Who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is He of Whom I said , After me comes a Man Who has priority over me [ Who takes rank above me ] because He was before me and existed before I did .
43001031	And I did not know Him and did not recognize Him [ myself ] ; but it is in order that He should be made manifest and be revealed to Israel [ be brought out where we can see Him ] that I came baptizing in ( with ) water .
43001032	John gave further evidence , saying , I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven , and it dwelt on Him [ never to depart ] .
43001033	And I did not know Him nor recognize Him , but He Who sent me to baptize in ( with ) water said to me , Upon Him Whom you shall see the Spirit descend and remain , that One is He Who baptizes with the Holy Spirit .
43001034	And I have seen [ that happen -- I actually did see it ] and my testimony is that this is the Son of God !
43001035	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples ,
43001036	And he looked at Jesus as He walked along , and said , Look ! There is the Lamb of God !
43001037	The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Him .
43001038	But Jesus turned , and as He saw them following Him , He said to them , What are you looking for ? [ And what is it you wish ? ] And they answered Him , Rabbi -- which translated is Teacher -- where are You staying ?
43001039	He said to them , Come and see . So they went and saw where He was staying , and they remained with Him that day . It was then about the tenth hour ( about four o’clock in the afternoon ) .
43001040	One of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus was Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother .
43001041	He first sought out and found his own brother Simon and said to him , We have found ( discovered ) the Messiah ! -- which translated is the Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
43001042	Andrew then led ( brought ) Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , You are Simon son of John . You shall be called Cephas -- which translated is Peter [ Stone ] .
43001043	The next day Jesus desired and decided to go into Galilee ; and He found Philip and said to him , Join Me as My attendant and follow Me .
43001044	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , of the same city as Andrew and Peter .
43001045	Philip sought and found Nathanael and told him , We have found ( discovered ) the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about -- Jesus from Nazareth , the [ legal ] son of Joseph !
43001046	Nathanael answered him , [ Nazareth ! ] Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? Philip replied , Come and see !
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said concerning him , See ! Here is an Israelite indeed [ a true descendant of Jacob ] , in whom there is no guile nor deceit nor falsehood nor duplicity !
43001048	Nathanael said to Jesus , How do You know me ? [ How is it that You know these things about me ? ] Jesus answered him , Before [ ever ] Philip called you , when you were still under the fig tree , I saw you .
43001049	Nathanael answered , Teacher , You are the Son of God ! You are the King of Israel !
43001050	Jesus replied , Because I said to you , I saw you beneath the fig tree , do you believe in and rely on and trust in Me ? You shall see greater things than this !
43001051	Then He said to him , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you all , you shall see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man !
43002001	ON THE third day there was a wedding at Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there .
43002002	Jesus also was invited with His disciples to the wedding .
43002003	And when the wine was all gone , the mother of Jesus said to Him , They have no more wine !
43002004	Jesus said to her , [ Dear ] woman , what is that to you and to Me ? [ What do we have in common ? Leave it to Me . ] My time ( hour to act ) has not yet come .
43002005	His mother said to the servants , Whatever He says to you , do it .
43002006	Now there were six waterpots of stone standing there , as the Jewish custom of purification ( ceremonial washing ) demanded , holding twenty to thirty gallons apiece .
43002007	Jesus said to them , Fill the waterpots with water . So they filled them up to the brim .
43002008	Then He said to them , Draw some out now and take it to the manager of the feast [ to the one presiding , the superintendent of the banquet ] . So they took him some .
43002009	And when the manager tasted the water just now turned into wine , not knowing where it came from -- though the servants who had drawn the water knew -- he called the bridegroom
43002010	And said to him , Everyone else serves his best wine first , and when people have drunk freely , then he serves that which is not so good ; but you have kept back the good wine until now !
43002011	This , the first of His signs ( miracles , wonderworks ) , Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee , and manifested His glory [ by it He displayed His greatness and His power openly ] , and His disciples believed in Him [ adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Him ] .
43002012	After that He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and disciples , and they stayed there only a few days .
43002013	Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching , so Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	There He found in the temple [ enclosure ] those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the money changers sitting there [ also at their stands ] .
43002015	And having made a lash ( a whip ) of cords , He drove them all out of the temple [ enclosure ] -- both the sheep and the oxen -- spilling and scattering the brokers’ money and upsetting and tossing around their trays ( their stands ) .
43002016	Then to those who sold the doves He said , Take these things away ( out of here ) ! Make not My Father’s house a house of merchandise ( a marketplace , a sales shop ) !
43002017	And His disciples remembered that it is written [ in the Holy Scriptures ] , Zeal ( the fervor of love ) for Your house will eat Me up . [ I will be consumed with jealousy for the honor of Your house . ]
43002018	Then the Jews retorted , What sign can You show us , seeing You do these things ? [ What sign , miracle , token , indication can You give us as evidence that You have authority and are commissioned to act in this way ? ]
43002019	Jesus answered them , Destroy ( undo ) this temple , and in three days I will raise it up again .
43002020	Then the Jews replied , It took forty-six years to build this temple ( sanctuary ) , and will You raise it up in three days ?
43002021	But He had spoken of the temple which was His body .
43002022	When therefore He had risen from the dead , His disciples remembered that He said this . And so they believed and trusted and relied on the Scripture and the word ( message ) Jesus had spoken .
43002023	But when He was in Jerusalem during the Passover Feast , many believed in His name [ identified themselves with His party ] after seeing His signs ( wonders , miracles ) which He was doing .
43002024	But Jesus [ for His part ] did not trust Himself to them , because He knew all [ men ] ;
43002025	And He did not need anyone to bear witness concerning man [ needed no evidence from anyone about men ] , for He Himself knew what was in human nature . [ He could read men’s hearts . ]
43003001	NOW THERE was a certain man among the Pharisees named Nicodemus , a ruler ( a leader , an authority ) among the Jews ,
43003002	Who came to Jesus at night and said to Him , Rabbi , we know and are certain that You have come from God [ as ] a Teacher ; for no one can do these signs ( these wonderworks , these miracles -- and produce the proofs ) that You do unless God is with him .
43003003	Jesus answered him , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that unless a person is born again ( anew , from above ) , he cannot ever see ( know , be acquainted with , and experience ) the kingdom of God .
43003004	Nicodemus said to Him , How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter his mother’s womb again and be born ?
43003005	Jesus answered , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , unless a man is born of water and [ even ] the Spirit , he cannot [ ever ] enter the kingdom of God .
43003006	What is born of [ from ] the flesh is flesh [ of the physical is physical ] ; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Marvel not [ do not be surprised , astonished ] at My telling you , You must all be born anew ( from above ) .
43003008	The wind blows ( breathes ) where it wills ; and though you hear its sound , yet you neither know where it comes from nor where it is going . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit .
43003009	Nicodemus answered by asking , How can all this be possible ?
43003010	Jesus replied , Are you the teacher of Israel , and yet do not know nor understand these things ? [ Are they strange to you ? ]
43003011	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , We speak only of what we know [ we know absolutely what we are talking about ] ; we have actually seen what we are testifying to [ we were eyewitnesses of it ] . And still you do not receive our testimony [ you reject and refuse our evidence -- that of Myself and of all those who are born of the Spirit ] .
43003012	If I have told you of things that happen right here on the earth and yet none of you believes Me , how can you believe ( trust Me , adhere to Me , rely on Me ) if I tell you of heavenly things ?
43003013	And yet no one has ever gone up to heaven , but there is One Who has come down from heaven -- the Son of Man [ Himself ] , Who is ( dwells , has His home ) in heaven .
43003014	And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert [ on a pole ] , so must [ so it is necessary that ] the Son of Man be lifted up [ on the cross ] ,
43003015	In order that everyone who believes in Him [ who cleaves to Him , trusts Him , and relies on Him ] may not perish , but have eternal life and [ actually ] live forever !
43003016	For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [ even ] gave up His only begotten ( unique ) Son , so that whoever believes in ( trusts in , clings to , relies on ) Him shall not perish ( come to destruction , be lost ) but have eternal ( everlasting ) life .
43003017	For God did not send the Son into the world in order to judge ( to reject , to condemn , to pass sentence on ) the world , but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him .
43003018	He who believes in Him [ who clings to , trusts in , relies on Him ] is not judged [ he who trusts in Him never comes up for judgment ; for him there is no rejection , no condemnation -- he incurs no damnation ] ; but he who does not believe ( cleave to , rely on , trust in Him ) is judged already [ he has already been convicted and has already received his sentence ] because he has not believed in and trusted in the name of the only begotten Son of God . [ He is condemned for refusing to let his trust rest in Christ’s name . ]
43003019	The [ basis of the ] judgment ( indictment , the test by which men are judged , the ground for the sentence ) lies in this : the Light has come into the world , and people have loved the darkness rather than and more than the Light , for their works ( deeds ) were evil .
43003020	For every wrongdoer hates ( loathes , detests ) the Light , and will not come out into the Light but shrinks from it , lest his works ( his deeds , his activities , his conduct ) be exposed and reproved .
43003021	But he who practices truth [ who does what is right ] comes out into the Light ; so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are -- wrought with God [ divinely prompted , done with God’s help , in dependence upon Him ] .
43003022	After this , Jesus and His disciples went into the land ( the countryside ) of Judea , where He remained with them , and baptized .
43003023	But John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , for there was an abundance of water there , and the people kept coming and being baptized .
43003024	For John had not yet been thrown into prison .
43003025	Therefore there arose a controversy between some of John’s disciples and a Jew in regard to purification .
43003026	So they came to John and reported to him , Rabbi , the Man Who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [ at the Jordan crossing ] -- and to Whom you yourself have borne testimony -- notice , here He is baptizing too , and everybody is flocking to Him !
43003027	John answered , A man can receive nothing [ he can claim nothing , he can take unto himself nothing ] except as it has been granted to him from heaven . [ A man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from heaven ; there is no other source . ]
43003028	You yourselves are my witnesses [ you personally bear me out ] that I stated , I am not the Christ ( the Anointed One , the Messiah ) , but I have [ only ] been sent before Him [ in advance of Him , to be His appointed forerunner , His messenger , His announcer ] .
43003029	He who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the groomsman who stands by and listens to him rejoices greatly and heartily on account of the bridegroom’s voice . This then is my pleasure and joy , and it is now complete .
43003030	He must increase , but I must decrease . [ He must grow more prominent ; I must grow less so . ]
43003031	He Who comes from above ( heaven ) is [ far ] above all [ others ] ; he who comes from the earth belongs to the earth , and talks the language of earth [ his words are from an earthly standpoint ] . He Who comes from heaven is [ far ] above all others [ far superior to all others in prominence and in excellence ] .
43003032	It is to what He has [ actually ] seen and heard that He bears testimony , and yet no one accepts His testimony [ no one receives His evidence as true ] .
43003033	Whoever receives His testimony has set his seal of approval to this : God is true . [ That man has definitely certified , acknowledged , declared once and for all , and is himself assured that it is divine truth that God cannot lie ] .
43003034	For since He Whom God has sent speaks the words of God [ proclaims God’s own message ] , God does not give Him His Spirit sparingly or by measure , but boundless is the gift God makes of His Spirit !
43003035	The Father loves the Son and has given ( entrusted , committed ) everything into His hand .
43003036	And he who believes in ( has faith in , clings to , relies on ) the Son has ( now possesses ) eternal life . But whoever disobeys ( is unbelieving toward , refuses to trust in , disregards , is not subject to ) the Son will never see ( experience ) life , but [ instead ] the wrath of God abides on him . [ God’s displeasure remains on him ; His indignation hangs over him continually . ]
43004001	NOW WHEN the Lord knew ( learned , became aware ) that the Pharisees had been told that Jesus was winning and baptizing more disciples than John --
43004002	Though Jesus Himself did not baptize , but His disciples --
43004003	He left Judea and returned to Galilee .
43004004	It was necessary for Him to go through Samaria .
43004005	And in doing so , He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar , near the tract of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
43004006	And Jacob’s well was there . So Jesus , tired as He was from His journey , sat down [ to rest ] by the well . It was then about the sixth hour ( about noon ) .
43004007	Presently , when a woman of Samaria came along to draw water , Jesus said to her , Give Me a drink --
43004008	For His disciples had gone off into the town to buy food --
43004009	The Samaritan woman said to Him , How is it that You , being a Jew , ask me , a Samaritan [ and a ] woman , for a drink ? -- For the Jews have nothing to do with the Samaritans --
43004010	Jesus answered her , If you had only known and had recognized God’s gift and Who this is that is saying to you , Give Me a drink , you would have asked Him [ instead ] and He would have given you living water .
43004011	She said to Him , Sir , You have nothing to draw with [ no drawing bucket ] and the well is deep ; how then can You provide living water ? [ Where do You get Your living water ? ]
43004012	Are You greater than and superior to our ancestor Jacob , who gave us this well and who used to drink from it himself , and his sons and his cattle also ?
43004013	Jesus answered her , All who drink of this water will be thirsty again .
43004014	But whoever takes a drink of the water that I will give him shall never , no never , be thirsty any more . But the water that I will give him shall become a spring of water welling up ( flowing , bubbling ) [ continually ] within him unto ( into , for ) eternal life .
43004015	The woman said to Him , Sir , give me this water , so that I may never get thirsty nor have to come [ continually all the way ] here to draw .
43004016	At this , Jesus said to her , Go , call your husband and come back here .
43004017	The woman answered , I have no husband . Jesus said to her , You have spoken truly in saying , I have no husband .
43004018	For you have had five husbands , and the man you are now living with is not your husband . In this you have spoken truly .
43004019	The woman said to Him , Sir , I see and understand that You are a prophet .
43004020	Our forefathers worshiped on this mountain , but you [ Jews ] say that Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary and proper to worship .
43004021	Jesus said to her , Woman , believe Me , a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither [ merely ] in this mountain nor [ merely ] in Jerusalem .
43004022	You [ Samaritans ] do not know what you are worshiping [ you worship what you do not comprehend ] . We do know what we are worshiping [ we worship what we have knowledge of and understand ] , for [ after all ] salvation comes from [ among ] the Jews .
43004023	A time will come , however , indeed it is already here , when the true ( genuine ) worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth ( reality ) ; for the Father is seeking just such people as these as His worshipers .
43004024	God is a Spirit ( a spiritual Being ) and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth ( reality ) .
43004025	The woman said to Him , I know that Messiah is coming , He Who is called the Christ ( the Anointed One ) ; and when He arrives , He will tell us everything we need to know and make it clear to us .
43004026	Jesus said to her , I Who now speak with you am He .
43004027	Just then His disciples came and they wondered ( were surprised , astonished ) to find Him talking with a woman [ a married woman ] . However , not one of them asked Him , What are You inquiring about ? or What do You want ? or , Why do You speak with her ?
43004028	Then the woman left her water jar and went away to the town . And she began telling the people ,
43004029	Come , see a Man Who has told me everything that I ever did ! Can this be [ is not this ] the Christ ? [ Must not this be the Messiah , the Anointed One ? ]
43004030	So the people left the town and set out to go to Him .
43004031	Meanwhile , the disciples urged Him saying , Rabbi , eat something .
43004032	But He assured them , I have food ( nourishment ) to eat of which you know nothing and have no idea .
43004033	So the disciples said one to another , Has someone brought Him something to eat ?
43004034	Jesus said to them , My food ( nourishment ) is to do the will ( pleasure ) of Him Who sent Me and to accomplish and completely finish His work .
43004035	Do you not say , It is still four months until harvest time comes ? Look ! I tell you , raise your eyes and observe the fields and see how they are already white for harvesting .
43004036	Already the reaper is getting his wages [ he who does the cutting now has his reward ] , for he is gathering fruit ( crop ) unto life eternal , so that he who does the planting and he who does the reaping may rejoice together .
43004037	For in this the saying holds true , One sows and another reaps .
43004038	I sent you to reap a crop for which you have not toiled . Other men have labored and you have stepped in to reap the results of their work .
43004039	Now numerous Samaritans from that town believed in and trusted in Him because of what the woman said when she declared and testified , He told me everything that I ever did .
43004040	So when the Samaritans arrived , they asked Him to remain with them , and He did stay there two days .
43004041	Then many more believed in and adhered to and relied on Him because of His personal message [ what He Himself said ] .
43004042	And they told the woman , Now we no longer believe ( trust , have faith ) just because of what you said ; for we have heard Him ourselves [ personally ] , and we know that He truly is the Savior of the world , the Christ .
43004043	But after these two days Jesus went on from there into Galilee --
43004044	Although He Himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
43004045	However , when He came into Galilee , the Galileans also welcomed Him and took Him to their hearts eagerly , for they had seen everything that He did in Jerusalem during the Feast ; for they too had attended the Feast .
43004046	So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee , where He had turned the water into wine . And there was a certain royal official whose son was lying ill in Capernaum .
43004047	Having heard that Jesus had come back from Judea into Galilee , he went away to meet Him and began to beg Him to come down and cure his son , for he was lying at the point of death .
43004048	Then Jesus said to him , Unless you see signs and miracles happen , you [ people ] never will believe ( trust , have faith ) at all .
43004049	The king’s officer pleaded with Him , Sir , do come down at once before my little child is dead !
43004050	Jesus answered him , Go in peace ; your son will live ! And the man put his trust in what Jesus said and started home .
43004051	But even as he was on the road going down , his servants met him and reported , saying , Your son lives !
43004052	So he asked them at what time he had begun to get better . They said , Yesterday during the seventh hour ( about one o’clock in the afternoon ) the fever left him .
43004053	Then the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him , Your son will live . And he and his entire household believed ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Jesus ) .
43004054	This is the second sign ( wonderwork , miracle ) that Jesus performed after He had come out of Judea into Galilee .
43005001	LATER ON there was a Jewish festival ( feast ) for which Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep Gate . This pool in the Hebrew is called Bethesda , having five porches ( alcoves , colonnades , doorways ) .
43005003	In these lay a great number of sick folk -- some blind , some crippled , and some paralyzed ( shriveled up ) -- waiting for the bubbling up of the water .
43005004	For an angel of the Lord went down at appointed seasons into the pool and moved and stirred up the water ; whoever then first , after the stirring up of the water , stepped in was cured of whatever disease with which he was afflicted .
43005005	There was a certain man there who had suffered with a deep-seated and lingering disorder for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus noticed him lying there [ helpless ] , knowing that he had already been a long time in that condition , He said to him , Do you want to become well ? [ Are you really in earnest about getting well ? ]
43005007	The invalid answered , Sir , I have nobody when the water is moving to put me into the pool ; but while I am trying to come [ into it ] myself , somebody else steps down ahead of me .
43005008	Jesus said to him , Get up ! Pick up your bed ( sleeping pad ) and walk !
43005009	Instantly the man became well and recovered his strength and picked up his bed and walked . But that happened on the Sabbath .
43005010	So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed , It is the Sabbath , and you have no right to pick up your bed [ it is not lawful ] .
43005011	He answered them , The Man Who healed me and gave me back my strength , He Himself said to me , Pick up your bed and walk !
43005012	They asked him , Who is the Man Who told you , Pick up your bed and walk ?
43005013	Now the invalid who had been healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had quietly gone away [ had passed on unnoticed ] , since there was a crowd in the place .
43005014	Afterward , when Jesus found him in the temple , He said to him , See , you are well ! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you .
43005015	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus Who had made him well .
43005016	For this reason the Jews began to persecute ( annoy , torment ) Jesus and sought to kill Him , because He was doing these things on the Sabbath .
43005017	But Jesus answered them , My Father has worked [ even ] until now , [ He has never ceased working ; He is still working ] and I , too , must be at [ divine ] work .
43005018	This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him [ to do away with Him ] ; because He not only was breaking ( weakening , violating ) the Sabbath , but He actually was speaking of God as being [ in a special sense ] His own Father , making Himself equal [ putting Himself on a level ] with God .
43005019	So Jesus answered them by saying , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , the Son is able to do nothing of Himself ( of His own accord ) ; but He is able to do only what He sees the Father doing , for whatever the Father does is what the Son does in the same way [ in His turn ] .
43005020	The Father dearly loves the Son and discloses to ( shows ) Him everything that He Himself does . And He will disclose to Him ( let Him see ) greater things yet than these , so that you may marvel and be full of wonder and astonishment .
43005021	Just as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life [ makes them live on ] , even so the Son also gives life to whomever He wills and is pleased to give it .
43005022	Even the Father judges no one , for He has given all judgment ( the last judgment and the whole business of judging ) entirely into the hands of the Son ,
43005023	So that all men may give honor ( reverence , homage ) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father . [ In fact ] whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father , Who has sent Him .
43005024	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , the person whose ears are open to My words [ who listens to My message ] and believes and trusts in and clings to and relies on Him Who sent Me has ( possesses now ) eternal life . And he does not come into judgment [ does not incur sentence of judgment , will not come under condemnation ] , but he has already passed over out of death into life .
43005025	Believe Me when I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , the time is coming and is here now when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear it shall live .
43005026	For even as the Father has life in Himself and is self-existent , so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself and be self-existent .
43005027	And He has given Him authority and granted Him power to execute ( exercise , practice ) judgment because He is a Son of man [ very man ] .
43005028	Do not be surprised and wonder at this , for the time is coming when all those who are in the tombs shall hear His voice ,
43005029	And they shall come out -- those who have practiced doing good [ will come out ] to the resurrection of [ new ] life , and those who have done evil will be raised for judgment [ raised to meet their sentence ] .
43005030	I am able to do nothing from Myself [ independently , of My own accord -- but only as I am taught by God and as I get His orders ] . Even as I hear , I judge [ I decide as I am bidden to decide . As the voice comes to Me , so I give a decision ] , and My judgment is right ( just , righteous ) , because I do not seek or consult My own will [ I have no desire to do what is pleasing to Myself , My own aim , My own purpose ] but only the will and pleasure of the Father Who sent Me .
43005031	If I alone testify in My behalf , My testimony is not valid and cannot be worth anything .
43005032	There is Another Who testifies concerning Me , and I know and am certain that His evidence on My behalf is true and valid .
43005033	You yourselves have sent [ an inquiry ] to John and he has been a witness to the truth .
43005034	But I do not receive [ a mere ] human witness [ the evidence which I accept on My behalf is not from man ] ; but I simply mention all these things in order that you may be saved ( made and kept safe and sound ) .
43005035	John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [ to show you the way ] , and you were willing for a while to delight ( sun ) yourselves in his light .
43005036	But I have as My witness something greater ( weightier , higher , better ) than that of John ; for the works that the Father has appointed Me to accomplish and finish , the very same works that I am now doing , are a witness and proof that the Father has sent Me .
43005037	And the Father Who sent Me has Himself testified concerning Me . Not one of you has ever given ear to His voice or seen His form ( His face -- what He is like ) . [ You have always been deaf to His voice and blind to the vision of Him . ]
43005038	And you have not His word ( His thought ) living in your hearts , because you do not believe and adhere to and trust in and rely on Him Whom He has sent . [ That is why you do not keep His message living in you , because you do not believe in the Messenger Whom He has sent . ]
43005039	You search and investigate and pore over the Scriptures diligently , because you suppose and trust that you have eternal life through them . And these [ very Scriptures ] testify about Me !
43005040	And still you are not willing [ but refuse ] to come to Me , so that you might have life .
43005041	I receive not glory from men [ I crave no human honor , I look for no mortal fame ] ,
43005042	But I know you and recognize and understand that you have not the love of God in you .
43005043	I have come in My Father’s name and with His power , and you do not receive Me [ your hearts are not open to Me , you give Me no welcome ] ; but if another comes in his own name and his own power and with no other authority but himself , you will receive him and give him your approval .
43005044	How is it possible for you to believe [ how can you learn to believe ] , you who [ are content to seek and ] receive praise and honor and glory from one another , and yet do not seek the praise and honor and glory which come from Him Who alone is God ?
43005045	Put out of your minds the thought and do not suppose [ as some of you are supposing ] that I will accuse you before the Father . There is one who accuses you -- it is Moses , the very one on whom you have built your hopes [ in whom you trust ] .
43005046	For if you believed and relied on Moses , you would believe and rely on Me , for he wrote about Me [ personally ] .
43005047	But if you do not believe and trust his writings , how then will you believe and trust My teachings ? [ How shall you cleave to and rely on My words ? ]
43006001	AFTER THIS , Jesus went to the farther side of the Sea of Galilee -- that is , the Sea of Tiberias .
43006002	And a great crowd was following Him because they had seen the signs ( miracles ) which He [ continually ] performed upon those who were sick .
43006003	And Jesus walked up the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples .
43006004	Now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was approaching .
43006005	Jesus looked up then , and seeing that a vast multitude was coming toward Him , He said to Philip , Where are we to buy bread , so that all these people may eat ?
43006006	But He said this to prove ( test ) him , for He well knew what He was about to do .
43006007	Philip answered Him , Two hundred pennies’ ( forty dollars ) worth of bread is not enough that everyone may receive even a little .
43006008	Another of His disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter’s brother , said to Him ,
43006009	There is a little boy here , who has [ with him ] five barley loaves , and two small fish ; but what are they among so many people ?
43006010	Jesus said , Make all the people recline ( sit down ) . Now the ground ( a pasture ) was covered with thick grass at the spot , so the men threw themselves down , about 5,000 in number .
43006011	Jesus took the loaves , and when He had given thanks , He distributed to the disciples and the disciples to the reclining people ; so also [ He did ] with the fish , as much as they wanted .
43006012	When they had all had enough , He said to His disciples , Gather up now the fragments ( the broken pieces that are left over ) , so that nothing may be lost and wasted .
43006013	So accordingly they gathered them up , and they filled twelve [ small hand ] baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves .
43006014	When the people saw the sign ( miracle ) that Jesus had performed , they began saying , Surely and beyond a doubt this is the Prophet Who is to come into the world !
43006015	Then Jesus , knowing that they meant to come and seize Him that they might make Him king , withdrew again to the hillside by Himself alone .
43006016	When evening came , His disciples went down to the sea ,
43006017	And they took a boat and were going across the sea to Capernaum . It was now dark , and still Jesus had not [ yet ] come back to them .
43006018	Meanwhile , the sea was getting rough and rising high because of a great and violent wind that was blowing .
43006019	[ However ] when they had rowed three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat . And they were afraid ( terrified ) .
43006020	But Jesus said to them , It is I ; be not afraid ! [ I AM ; stop being frightened ! ]
43006021	Then they were quite willing and glad for Him to come into the boat . And now the boat went at once to the land they had steered toward . [ And immediately they reached the shore toward which they had been slowly making their way . ]
43006022	The next day the crowd [ that still remained ] standing on the other side of the sea realized that there had been only one small boat there , and that Jesus had not gone into it with His disciples , but that His disciples had gone away by themselves .
43006023	But now some other boats from Tiberias had come in near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	So the people , finding that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there , themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
43006025	And when they found Him on the other side of the lake , they said to Him , Rabbi ! When did You come here ?
43006026	Jesus answered them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , you have been searching for Me , not because you saw the miracles and signs but because you were fed with the loaves and were filled and satisfied .
43006027	Stop toiling and doing and producing for the food that perishes and decomposes [ in the using ] , but strive and work and produce rather for the [ lasting ] food which endures [ continually ] unto life eternal ; the Son of Man will give ( furnish ) you that , for God the Father has authorized and certified Him and put His seal of endorsement upon Him .
43006028	They then said , What are we to do , that we may [ habitually ] be working the works of God ? [ What are we to do to carry out what God requires ? ]
43006029	Jesus replied , This is the work ( service ) that God asks of you : that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [ that you cleave to , trust , rely on , and have faith in His Messenger ] .
43006030	Therefore they said to Him , What sign ( miracle , wonderwork ) will You perform then , so that we may see it and believe and rely on and adhere to You ? What [ supernatural ] work have You [ to show what You can do ] ?
43006031	Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as the Scripture says , He gave them bread out of heaven to eat .
43006032	Jesus then said to them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , Moses did not give you the Bread from heaven [ what Moses gave you was not the Bread from heaven ] , but it is My Father Who gives you the true heavenly Bread .
43006033	For the Bread of God is He Who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world .
43006034	Then they said to Him , Lord , give us this bread always ( all the time ) !
43006035	Jesus replied , I am the Bread of Life . He who comes to Me will never be hungry , and he who believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me will never thirst any more ( at any time ) .
43006036	But [ as ] I told you , although you have seen Me , still you do not believe and trust and have faith .
43006037	All whom My Father gives ( entrusts ) to Me will come to Me ; and the one who comes to Me I will most certainly not cast out [ I will never , no never , reject one of them who comes to Me ] .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will and purpose but to do the will and purpose of Him Who sent Me .
43006039	And this is the will of Him Who sent Me , that I should not lose any of all that He has given Me , but that I should give new life and raise [ them all ] up at the last day .
43006040	For this is My Father’s will and His purpose , that everyone who sees the Son and believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Him should have eternal life , and I will raise him up [ from the dead ] at the last day .
43006041	Now the Jews murmured and found fault with and grumbled about Jesus because He said , I am [ Myself ] the Bread that came down from heaven .
43006042	They kept asking , Is not this Jesus , the Son of Joseph , Whose father and mother we know ? How then can He say , I have come down from heaven ?
43006043	So Jesus answered them , Stop grumbling and saying things against Me to one another .
43006044	No one is able to come to Me unless the Father Who sent Me attracts and draws him and gives him the desire to come to Me , and [ then ] I will raise him up [ from the dead ] at the last day .
43006045	It is written in [ the book of ] the Prophets , And they shall all be taught of God [ have Him in person for their Teacher ] . Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me --
43006046	Which does not imply that anyone has seen the Father [ not that anyone has ever seen Him ] except He [ Who was with the Father ] Who comes from God ; He [ alone ] has seen the Father .
43006047	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , he who believes in Me [ who adheres to , trusts in , relies on , and has faith in Me ] has ( now possesses ) eternal life .
43006048	I am the Bread of Life [ that gives life -- the Living Bread ] .
43006049	Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and [ yet ] they died .
43006050	[ But ] this is the Bread that comes down from heaven , so that [ any ] one may eat of it and never die .
43006051	I [ Myself ] am this Living Bread that came down from heaven . If anyone eats of this Bread , he will live forever ; and also the Bread that I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh ( body ) .
43006052	Then the Jews angrily contended with one another , saying , How is He able to give us His flesh to eat ?
43006053	And Jesus said to them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , you cannot have any life in you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [ unless you appropriate His life and the saving merit of His blood ] .
43006054	He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood has ( possesses now ) eternal life , and I will raise him up [ from the dead ] on the last day .
43006055	For My flesh is true and genuine food , and My blood is true and genuine drink .
43006056	He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood dwells continually in Me , and I [ in like manner dwell continually ] in him .
43006057	Just as the living Father sent Me and I live by ( through , because of ) the Father , even so whoever continues to feed on Me [ whoever takes Me for his food and is nourished by Me ] shall [ in his turn ] live through and because of Me .
43006058	This is the Bread that came down from heaven . It is not like the manna which our forefathers ate , and yet died ; he who takes this Bread for his food shall live forever .
43006059	He said these things in a synagogue while He was teaching at Capernaum .
43006060	When His disciples heard this , many of them said , This is a hard and difficult and strange saying ( an offensive and unbearable message ) . Who can stand to hear it ? [ Who can be expected to listen to such teaching ? ]
43006061	But Jesus , knowing within Himself that His disciples were complaining and protesting and grumbling about it , said to them : Is this a stumbling block and an offense to you ? [ Does this upset and displease and shock and scandalize you ? ]
43006062	What then [ will be your reaction ] if you should see the Son of Man ascending to [ the place ] where He was before ?
43006063	It is the Spirit Who gives life [ He is the Life-giver ] ; the flesh conveys no benefit whatever [ there is no profit in it ] . The words ( truths ) that I have been speaking to you are spirit and life .
43006064	But [ still ] some of you fail to believe and trust and have faith . For Jesus knew from the first who did not believe and had no faith and who would betray Him and be false to Him .
43006065	And He said , This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted him [ unless he is enabled to do so ] by the Father .
43006066	After this , many of His disciples drew back ( returned to their old associations ) and no longer accompanied Him .
43006067	Jesus said to the Twelve , Will you also go away ? [ And do you too desire to leave Me ? ]
43006068	Simon Peter answered , Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words ( the message ) of eternal life .
43006069	And we have learned to believe and trust , and [ more ] we have come to know [ surely ] that You are the Holy One of God , the Christ ( the Anointed One ) , the Son of the living God .
43006070	Jesus answered them , Did I not choose you , the Twelve ? And [ yet ] one of you is a devil ( of the evil one and a false accuser ) .
43006071	He was speaking of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , for he was about to betray Him , [ although ] he was one of the Twelve .
43007001	AFTER THIS , Jesus went from place to place in Galilee , for He would not travel in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him .
43007002	Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was drawing near .
43007003	So His brothers said to Him , Leave here and go into Judea , so that Your disciples [ there ] may also see the works that You do . [ This is no place for You . ]
43007004	For no one does anything in secret when he wishes to be conspicuous and secure publicity . If You [ must ] do these things [ if You must act like this ] , show Yourself openly and make Yourself known to the world !
43007005	For [ even ] His brothers did not believe in or adhere to or trust in or rely on Him either .
43007006	Whereupon Jesus said to them , My time ( opportunity ) has not come yet ; but any time is suitable for you and your opportunity is ready any time [ is always here ] .
43007007	The world cannot [ be expected to ] hate you , but it does hate Me because I denounce it for its wicked works and reveal that its doings are evil .
43007008	Go to the Feast yourselves . I am not [ yet ] going up to the Festival , because My time is not ripe . [ My term is not yet completed ; it is not time for Me to go . ]
43007009	Having said these things to them , He stayed behind in Galilee .
43007010	But afterward , when His brothers had gone up to the Feast , He went up also , not publicly [ not with a caravan ] , but by Himself quietly and as if He did not wish to be observed .
43007011	Therefore the Jews kept looking for Him at the Feast and asking , Where can He be ? [ Where is that Fellow ? ]
43007012	And there was among the mass of the people much whispered discussion and hot disputing about Him . Some were saying , He is good ! [ He is a good Man ! ] Others said , No , He misleads and deceives the people [ gives them false ideas ] !
43007013	But no one dared speak out boldly about Him for fear of [ the leaders of ] the Jews .
43007014	When the Feast was already half over , Jesus went up into the temple [ court ] and began to teach .
43007015	The Jews were astonished . They said , How is it that this Man has learning [ is so versed in the sacred Scriptures and in theology ] when He has never studied ?
43007016	Jesus answered them by saying , My teaching is not My own , but His Who sent Me .
43007017	If any man desires to do His will ( God’s pleasure ) , he will know ( have the needed illumination to recognize , and can tell for himself ) whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking from Myself and of My own accord and on My own authority .
43007018	He who speaks on his own authority seeks to win honor for himself . [ He whose teaching originates with himself seeks his own glory . ] But He Who seeks the glory and is eager for the honor of Him Who sent Him , He is true ; and there is no unrighteousness or falsehood or deception in Him .
43007019	Did not Moses give you the Law ? And yet not one of you keeps the Law . [ If that is the truth ] why do you seek to kill Me [ for not keeping it ] ?
43007020	The crowd answered Him , You are possessed by a demon ! [ You are raving ! ] Who seeks to kill You ?
43007021	Jesus answered them , I did one work , and you all are astounded .
43007022	Now Moses established circumcision among you -- though it did not originate with Moses but with the previous patriarchs -- and you circumcise a person [ even ] on the Sabbath day .
43007023	If , to avoid breaking the Law of Moses , a person undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath day , have you any cause to be angry with ( indignant with , bitter against ) Me for making a man’s whole body well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Be honest in your judgment and do not decide at a glance ( superficially and by appearances ) ; but judge fairly and righteously .
43007025	Then some of the Jerusalem people said , Is not this the Man they seek to kill ?
43007026	And here He is speaking openly , and they say nothing to Him ! Can it be possible that the rulers have discovered and know that this is truly the Christ ?
43007027	No , we know where this Man comes from ; when the Christ arrives , no one is to know from what place He comes .
43007028	Whereupon Jesus called out as He taught in the temple [ porches ] , Do you know Me , and do you know where I am from ? I have not come on My own authority and of My own accord and as self-appointed , but the One Who sent Me is true ( real , genuine , steadfast ) ; and Him you do not know !
43007029	I know Him [ Myself ] because I come from His [ very ] presence , and it was He [ personally ] Who sent Me .
43007030	Therefore they were eager to arrest Him , but no one laid a hand on Him , for His hour ( time ) had not yet come .
43007031	And besides , many of the multitude believed in Him [ adhered to Him , trusted in Him , relied on Him ] . And they kept saying , When the Christ comes , will He do [ can He be expected to do ] more miracles and produce more proofs and signs than what this Man has done ?
43007032	The Pharisees learned how the people were saying these things about Him under their breath ; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent attendants ( guards ) to arrest Him .
43007033	Therefore Jesus said , For a little while I am [ still ] with you , and then I go back to Him Who sent Me .
43007034	You will look for Me , but you will not [ be able to ] find Me ; where I am , you cannot come .
43007035	Then the Jews said among themselves , Where does this Man intend to go that we shall not find Him ? Will He go to the Jews who are scattered in the Dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What does this statement of His mean , You will look for Me and not be able to find Me , and , Where I am , you cannot come ?
43007037	Now on the final and most important day of the Feast , Jesus stood , and He cried in a loud voice , If any man is thirsty , let him come to Me and drink !
43007038	He who believes in Me [ who cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me ] as the Scripture has said , From his innermost being shall flow [ continuously ] springs and rivers of living water .
43007039	But He was speaking here of the Spirit , Whom those who believed ( trusted , had faith ) in Him were afterward to receive . For the [ Holy ] Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus was not yet glorified ( raised to honor ) .
43007040	Listening to those words , some of the multitude said , This is certainly and beyond doubt the Prophet !
43007041	Others said , This is the Christ ( the Messiah , Anointed One ) ! But some said , What ? Does the Christ come out of Galilee ?
43007042	Does not the Scripture tell us that the Christ will come from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem , the village where David lived ?
43007043	So there arose a division and dissension among the people concerning Him .
43007044	Some of them wanted to arrest Him , but no one [ ventured and ] laid hands on Him .
43007045	Meanwhile the attendants ( guards ) had gone back to the chief priests and Pharisees , who asked them , Why have you not brought Him here with you ?
43007046	The attendants replied , Never has a man talked as this Man talks ! [ No mere man has ever spoken as He speaks ! ]
43007047	The Pharisees said to them , Are you also deluded and led astray ? [ Are you also swept off your feet ? ]
43007048	Has any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in Him ?
43007049	As for this multitude ( rabble ) that does not know the Law , they are contemptible and doomed and accursed !
43007050	Then Nicodemus , who came to Jesus before at night and was one of them , asked ,
43007051	Does our Law convict a man without giving him a hearing and finding out what he has done ?
43007052	They answered him , Are you too from Galilee ? Search [ the Scriptures yourself ] , and you will see that no prophet comes ( will rise to prominence ) from Galilee .
43007053	And they went [ back ] , each to his own house .
43008001	BUT JESUS went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	Early in the morning ( at dawn ) , He came back into the temple [ court ] , and the people came to Him in crowds . He sat down and was teaching them ,
43008003	When the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery . They made her stand in the middle of the court and put the case before Him .
43008004	Teacher , they said , This woman has been caught in the very act of adultery .
43008005	Now Moses in the Law commanded us that such [ women -- offenders ] shall be stoned to death . But what do You say [ to do with her -- what is Your sentence ] ?
43008006	This they said to try ( test ) Him , hoping they might find a charge on which to accuse Him . But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger .
43008007	However , when they persisted with their question , He raised Himself up and said , Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her .
43008008	Then He bent down and went on writing on the ground with His finger .
43008009	They listened to Him , and then they began going out , conscience-stricken , one by one , from the oldest down to the last one of them , till Jesus was left alone , with the woman standing there before Him in the center of the court .
43008010	When Jesus raised Himself up , He said to her , Woman , where are your accusers ? Has no man condemned you ?
43008011	She answered , No one , Lord ! And Jesus said , I do not condemn you either . Go on your way and from now on sin no more .
43008012	Once more Jesus addressed the crowd . He said , I am the Light of the world . He who follows Me will not be walking in the dark , but will have the Light which is Life .
43008013	Whereupon the Pharisees told Him , You are testifying on Your own behalf ; Your testimony is not valid and is worthless .
43008014	Jesus answered , Even if I do testify on My own behalf , My testimony is true and reliable and valid , for I know where I came from and where I am going ; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going .
43008015	You [ set yourselves up to ] judge according to the flesh ( by what you see ) . [ You condemn by external , human standards . ] I do not [ set Myself up to ] judge or condemn or sentence anyone .
43008016	Yet even if I do judge , My judgment is true [ My decision is right ] ; for I am not alone [ in making it ] , but [ there are two of Us ] I and the Father , Who sent Me .
43008017	In your [ own ] Law it is written that the testimony ( evidence ) of two persons is reliable and valid .
43008018	I am One [ of the Two ] bearing testimony concerning Myself ; and My Father , Who sent Me , He also testifies about Me .
43008019	Then they said to Him , Where is this Father of Yours ? Jesus answered , You know My Father as little as you know Me . If you knew Me , you would know My Father also .
43008020	Jesus said these things in the treasury while He was teaching in the temple [ court ] ; but no one ventured to arrest Him , because His hour had not yet come .
43008021	Therefore He said again to them , I am going away , and you will be looking for Me , and you will die in ( under the curse of ) your sin . Where I am going , it is not possible for you to come .
43008022	At this the Jews began to ask among themselves , Will He kill Himself ? Is that why He says , Where I am going , it is not possible for you to come ?
43008023	He said to them , You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ( of this earthly order ) ; I am not of this world .
43008024	That is why I told you that you will die in ( under the curse of ) your sins ; for if you do not believe that I am He [ Whom I claim to be -- if you do not adhere to , trust in , and rely on Me ] , you will die in your sins .
43008025	Then they said to Him , Who are You anyway ? Jesus replied , [ Why do I even speak to you ! ] I am exactly what I have been telling you from the first .
43008026	I have much to say about you and to judge and condemn . But He Who sent Me is true ( reliable ) , and I tell the world [ only ] the things that I have heard from Him .
43008027	They did not perceive ( know , understand ) that He was speaking to them about the Father .
43008028	So Jesus added , When you have lifted up the Son of Man [ on the cross ] , you will realize ( know , understand ) that I am He [ for Whom you look ] and that I do nothing of Myself ( of My own accord or on My own authority ) , but I say [ exactly ] what My Father has taught Me .
43008029	And He Who sent Me is ever with Me ; My Father has not left Me alone , for I always do what pleases Him .
43008030	As He said these things , many believed in Him [ trusted , relied on , and adhered to Him ] .
43008031	So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him , If you abide in My word [ hold fast to My teachings and live in accordance with them ] , you are truly My disciples .
43008032	And you will know the Truth , and the Truth will set you free .
43008033	They answered Him , We are Abraham’s offspring ( descendants ) and have never been in bondage to anybody . What do You mean by saying , You will be set free ?
43008034	Jesus answered them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , Whoever commits and practices sin is the slave of sin .
43008035	Now a slave does not remain in a household permanently ( forever ) ; the son [ of the house ] does remain forever .
43008036	So if the Son liberates you [ makes you free men ] , then you are really and unquestionably free .
43008037	[ Yes ] I know that you are Abraham’s offspring ; yet you plan to kill Me , because My word has no entrance ( makes no progress , does not find any place ) in you .
43008038	I tell the things which I have seen and learned at My Father’s side , and your actions also reflect what you have heard and learned from your father .
43008039	They retorted , Abraham is our father . Jesus said , If you were [ truly ] Abraham’s children , then you would do the works of Abraham [ follow his example , do as Abraham did ] .
43008040	But now [ instead ] you are wanting and seeking to kill Me , a Man Who has told you the truth which I have heard from God . This is not the way Abraham acted .
43008041	You are doing the works of your [ own ] father . They said to Him , We are not illegitimate children and born out of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
43008042	Jesus said to them , If God were your Father , you would love Me and respect Me and welcome Me gladly , for I proceeded ( came forth ) from God [ out of His very presence ] . I did not even come on My own authority or of My own accord ( as self-appointed ) ; but He sent Me .
43008043	Why do you misunderstand what I say ? It is because you are unable to hear what I am saying . [ You cannot bear to listen to My message ; your ears are shut to My teaching . ]
43008044	You are of your father , the devil , and it is your will to practice the lusts and gratify the desires [ which are characteristic ] of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaks a falsehood , he speaks what is natural to him , for he is a liar [ himself ] and the father of lies and of all that is false .
43008045	But because I speak the truth , you do not believe Me [ do not trust Me , do not rely on Me , or adhere to Me ] .
43008046	Who of you convicts Me of wrongdoing or finds Me guilty of sin ? Then if I speak truth , why do you not believe Me [ trust Me , rely on , and adhere to Me ] ?
43008047	Whoever is of God listens to God . [ Those who belong to God hear the words of God . ] This is the reason that you do not listen [ to those words , to Me ] : because you do not belong to God and are not of God or in harmony with Him .
43008048	The Jews answered Him , Are we not right when we say You are a Samaritan and that You have a demon [ that You are under the power of an evil spirit ] ?
43008049	Jesus answered , I am not possessed by a demon . On the contrary , I honor and reverence My Father and you dishonor ( despise , vilify , and scorn ) Me .
43008050	However , I am not in search of honor for Myself . [ I do not seek and am not aiming for My own glory . ] There is One Who [ looks after that ; He ] seeks [ My glory ] , and He is the Judge .
43008051	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , if anyone observes My teaching [ lives in accordance with My message , keeps My word ] , he will by no means ever see and experience death .
43008052	The Jews said to Him , Now we know that You are under the power of a demon ( insane ) . Abraham died , and also the prophets , yet You say , If a man keeps My word , he will never taste of death into all eternity .
43008053	Are You greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and all the prophets died ! Who do You make Yourself out to be ?
43008054	Jesus answered , If I were to glorify Myself ( magnify , praise , and honor Myself ) , I would have no real glory , for My glory would be nothing and worthless . [ My honor must come to Me from My Father . ] It is My Father Who glorifies Me [ Who extols Me , magnifies , and praises Me ] , of Whom you say that He is your God .
43008055	Yet you do not know Him or recognize Him and are not acquainted with Him , but I know Him . If I should say that I do not know Him , I would be a liar like you . But I know Him and keep His word [ obey His teachings , am faithful to His message ] .
43008056	Your forefather Abraham was extremely happy at the hope and prospect of seeing My day ( My incarnation ) ; and he did see it and was delighted .
43008057	Then the Jews said to Him , You are not yet fifty years old , and have You seen Abraham ?
43008058	Jesus replied , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , before Abraham was born , I AM .
43008059	So they took up stones to throw at Him , but Jesus , by mixing with the crowd , concealed Himself and went out of the temple [ enclosure ] .
43009001	AS HE passed along , He noticed a man blind from his birth .
43009002	His disciples asked Him , Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he should be born blind ?
43009003	Jesus answered , It was not that this man or his parents sinned , but he was born blind in order that the workings of God should be manifested ( displayed and illustrated ) in him .
43009004	We must work the works of Him Who sent Me and be busy with His business while it is daylight ; night is coming on , when no man can work .
43009005	As long as I am in the world , I am the world’s Light .
43009006	When He had said this , He spat on the ground and made clay ( mud ) with His saliva , and He spread it [ as ointment ] on the man’s eyes .
43009007	And He said to him , Go , wash in the Pool of Siloam -- which means Sent . So he went and washed , and came back seeing .
43009008	When the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar saw him , they said , Is not this the man who used to sit and beg ?
43009009	Some said , It is he . Others said , No , but he looks very much like him . But he said , Yes , I am the man .
43009010	So they said to him , How were your eyes opened ?
43009011	He replied , The Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me , Go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and I obtained my sight !
43009012	They asked him , Where is He ? He said , I do not know .
43009013	Then they conducted to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind .
43009014	Now it was on the Sabbath day that Jesus mixed the mud and opened the man’s eyes .
43009015	So now again the Pharisees asked him how he received his sight . And he said to them , He smeared mud on my eyes , and I washed , and now I see .
43009016	Then some of the Pharisees said , This Man [ Jesus ] is not from God , because He does not observe the Sabbath . But others said , How can a man who is a sinner ( a bad man ) do such signs and miracles ? So there was a difference of opinion among them .
43009017	Accordingly they said to the blind man again , What do you say about Him , seeing that He opened your eyes ? And he said , He is [ He must be ] a prophet !
43009018	However , the Jews did not believe that he had [ really ] been blind and that he had received his sight until they called ( summoned ) the parents of the man .
43009019	They asked them , Is this your son , whom you reported as having been born blind ? How then does he see now ?
43009020	His parents answered , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind .
43009021	But as to how he can now see , we do not know ; or who has opened his eyes , we do not know . He is of age . Ask him ; let him speak for himself and give his own account of it .
43009022	His parents said this because they feared [ the leaders of ] the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ , he should be expelled and excluded from the synagogue .
43009023	On that account his parents said , He is of age ; ask him .
43009024	So the second time they summoned the man who had been born blind , and said to him , Now give God the glory ( praise ) . This Fellow we know is only a sinner ( a wicked person ) .
43009025	Then he answered , I do not know whether He is a sinner and wicked or not . But one thing I do know , that whereas I was blind before , now I see .
43009026	So they said to him , What did He [ actually ] do to you ? How did He open your eyes ?
43009027	He answered , I already told you and you would not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Can it be that you wish to become His disciples also ?
43009028	And they stormed at him [ they jeered , they sneered , they reviled him ] and retorted , You are His disciple yourself , but we are the disciples of Moses .
43009029	We know for certain that God spoke with Moses , but as for this Fellow , we know nothing about where He hails from .
43009030	The man replied , Well , this is astonishing ! Here a Man has opened my eyes , and yet you do not know where He comes from . [ That is amazing ! ]
43009031	We know that God does not listen to sinners ; but if anyone is God-fearing and a worshiper of Him and does His will , He listens to him .
43009032	Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind .
43009033	If this Man were not from God , He would not be able to do anything like this .
43009034	They retorted , You were wholly born in sin [ from head to foot ] ; and do you [ presume to ] teach us ? So they cast him out [ threw him clear outside the synagogue ] .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had put him out , and meeting him He said , Do you believe in and adhere to the Son of Man or the Son of God ?
43009036	He answered , Who is He , Sir ? Tell me , that I may believe in and adhere to Him .
43009037	Jesus said to him , You have seen Him ; [ in fact ] He is talking to you right now .
43009038	He called out , Lord , I believe ! [ I rely on , I trust , I cleave to You ! ] And he worshiped Him .
43009039	Then Jesus said , I came into this world for judgment [ as a Separator , in order that there may be separation between those who believe on Me and those who reject Me ] , to make the sightless see and to make those who see become blind .
43009040	Some Pharisees who were near , hearing this remark , said to Him , Are we also blind ?
43009041	Jesus said to them , If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but because you now claim to have sight , your sin remains . [ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin ; but because you insist , We do see clearly , you are unable to escape your guilt . ]
43010001	I ASSURE you , most solemnly I tell you , he who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold , but climbs up some other way ( elsewhere , from some other quarter ) is a thief and a robber .
43010002	But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The watchman opens the door for this man , and the sheep listen to his voice and heed it ; and he calls his own sheep by name and brings ( leads ) them out .
43010004	When he has brought his own sheep outside , he walks on before them , and the sheep follow him because they know his voice .
43010005	They will never [ on any account ] follow a stranger , but will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers or recognize their call .
43010006	Jesus used this parable ( illustration ) with them , but they did not understand what He was talking about .
43010007	So Jesus said again , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that I Myself am the Door for the sheep .
43010008	All others who came [ as such ] before Me are thieves and robbers , but the [ true ] sheep did not listen to and obey them .
43010009	I am the Door ; anyone who enters in through Me will be saved ( will live ) . He will come in and he will go out [ freely ] , and will find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy . I came that they may have and enjoy life , and have it in abundance ( to the full , till it overflows ) .
43010011	I am the Good Shepherd . The Good Shepherd risks and lays down His [ own ] life for the sheep .
43010012	But the hired servant ( he who merely serves for wages ) who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep , when he sees the wolf coming , deserts the flock and runs away . And the wolf chases and snatches them and scatters [ the flock ] .
43010013	Now the hireling flees because he merely serves for wages and is not himself concerned about the sheep [ cares nothing for them ] .
43010014	I am the Good Shepherd ; and I know and recognize My own , and My own know and recognize Me --
43010015	Even as [ truly as ] the Father knows Me and I also know the Father -- and I am giving My [ very own ] life and laying it down on behalf of the sheep .
43010016	And I have other sheep [ beside these ] that are not of this fold . I must bring and impel those also ; and they will listen to My voice and heed My call , and so there will be [ they will become ] one flock under one Shepherd .
43010017	For this [ reason ] the Father loves Me , because I lay down My [ own ] life -- to take it back again .
43010018	No one takes it away from Me . On the contrary , I lay it down voluntarily . [ I put it from Myself . ] I am authorized and have power to lay it down ( to resign it ) and I am authorized and have power to take it back again . These are the instructions ( orders ) which I have received [ as My charge ] from My Father .
43010019	Then a fresh division of opinion arose among the Jews because of His saying these things .
43010020	And many of them said , He has a demon and He is mad ( insane -- He raves , He rambles ) . Why do you listen to Him ?
43010021	Others argued , These are not the thoughts and the language of one possessed . Can a demon-possessed person open blind eyes ?
43010022	After this the Feast of Dedication [ of the reconsecration of the temple ] was taking place at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
43010023	And Jesus was walking in Solomon’s Porch in the temple area .
43010024	So the Jews surrounded Him and began asking Him , How long are You going to keep us in doubt and suspense ? If You are really the Christ ( the Messiah ) , tell us so plainly and openly .
43010025	Jesus answered them , I have told you so , yet you do not believe Me [ you do not trust Me and rely on Me ] . The very works that I do by the power of My Father and in My Father’s name bear witness concerning Me [ they are My credentials and evidence in support of Me ] .
43010026	But you do not believe and trust and rely on Me because you do not belong to My fold [ you are no sheep of Mine ] .
43010027	The sheep that are My own hear and are listening to My voice ; and I know them , and they follow Me .
43010028	And I give them eternal life , and they shall never lose it or perish throughout the ages . [ To all eternity they shall never by any means be destroyed . ] And no one is able to snatch them out of My hand .
43010029	My Father , Who has given them to Me , is greater and mightier than all [ else ] ; and no one is able to snatch [ them ] out of the Father’s hand .
43010030	I and the Father are One .
43010031	Again the Jews brought up stones to stone Him .
43010032	Jesus said to them , My Father has enabled Me to do many good deeds . [ I have shown many acts of mercy in your presence . ] For which of these do you mean to stone Me ?
43010033	The Jews replied , We are not going to stone You for a good act , but for blasphemy , because You , a mere Man , make Yourself [ out to be ] God .
43010034	Jesus answered , Is it not written in your Law , I said , You are gods ?
43010035	So men are called gods [ by the Law ] , men to whom God’s message came -- and the Scripture cannot be set aside or cancelled or broken or annulled --
43010036	[ If that is true ] do you say of the One Whom the Father consecrated and dedicated and set apart for Himself and sent into the world , You are blaspheming , because I said , I am the Son of God ?
43010037	If I am not doing the works [ performing the deeds ] of My Father , then do not believe Me [ do not adhere to Me and trust Me and rely on Me ] .
43010038	But if I do them , even though you do not believe Me or have faith in Me , [ at least ] believe the works and have faith in what I do , in order that you may know and understand [ clearly ] that the Father is in Me , and I am in the Father [ One with Him ] .
43010039	They sought again to arrest Him , but He escaped from their hands .
43010040	He went back again across the Jordan to the locality where John was when he first baptized , and there He remained .
43010041	And many came to Him , and they kept saying , John did not perform a [ single ] sign or miracle , but everything John said about this Man was true .
43010042	And many [ people ] there became believers in Him . [ They adhered to and trusted in and relied on Him . ]
43011001	NOW A certain man named Lazarus was ill . He was of Bethany , the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived .
43011002	This Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair . It was her brother Lazarus who was [ now ] sick .
43011003	So the sisters sent to Him , saying , Lord , he whom You love [ so well ] is sick .
43011004	When Jesus received the message , He said , This sickness is not to end in death ; but [ on the contrary ] it is to honor God and to promote His glory , that the Son of God may be glorified through ( by ) it .
43011005	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus . [ They were His dear friends , and He held them in loving esteem . ]
43011006	Therefore [ even ] when He heard that Lazarus was sick , He still stayed two days longer in the same place where He was .
43011007	Then after that interval He said to His disciples , Let us go back again to Judea .
43011008	The disciples said to Him , Rabbi , the Jews only recently were intending and trying to stone You , and are You [ thinking of ] going back there again ?
43011009	Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? Anyone who walks about in the daytime does not stumble , because he sees [ by ] the light of this world .
43011010	But if anyone walks about in the night , he does stumble , because there is no light in him [ the light is lacking to him ] .
43011011	He said these things , and then added , Our friend Lazarus is at rest and sleeping ; but I am going there that I may awaken him out of his sleep .
43011012	The disciples answered , Lord , if he is sleeping , he will recover .
43011013	However , Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that He referred to falling into a refreshing and natural sleep .
43011014	So then Jesus told them plainly , Lazarus is dead ,
43011015	And for your sake I am glad that I was not there ; it will help you to believe ( to trust and rely on Me ) . However , let us go to him .
43011016	Then Thomas , who was called the Twin , said to his fellow disciples , Let us go too , that we may die [ be killed ] along with Him .
43011017	So when Jesus arrived , He found that he [ Lazarus ] had already been in the tomb four days .
43011018	Bethany was near Jerusalem , only about two miles away ,
43011019	And a considerable number of the Jews had gone out to see Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went to meet Him , while Mary remained sitting in the house .
43011021	Martha then said to Jesus , Master , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	And even now I know that whatever You ask from God , He will grant it to You .
43011023	Jesus said to her , Your brother shall rise again .
43011024	Martha replied , I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
43011025	Jesus said to her , I am [ Myself ] the Resurrection and the Life . Whoever believes in ( adheres to , trusts in , and relies on ) Me , although he may die , yet he shall live ;
43011026	And whoever continues to live and believes in ( has faith in , cleaves to , and relies on ) Me shall never [ actually ] die at all . Do you believe this ?
43011027	She said to Him , Yes , Lord , I have believed [ I do believe ] that You are the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) , the Son of God , [ even He ] Who was to come into the world . [ It is for Your coming that the world has waited . ]
43011028	After she had said this , she went back and called her sister Mary , privately whispering to her , The Teacher is close at hand and is asking for you .
43011029	When she heard this , she sprang up quickly and went to Him .
43011030	Now Jesus had not yet entered the village , but was still at the same spot where Martha had met Him .
43011031	When the Jews who were sitting with her in the house and consoling her saw how hastily Mary had arisen and gone out , they followed her , supposing that she was going to the tomb to pour out her grief there .
43011032	When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw Him , she dropped down at His feet , saying to Him , Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011033	When Jesus saw her sobbing , and the Jews who came with her [ also ] sobbing , He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled . [ He chafed in spirit and sighed and was disturbed . ]
43011034	And He said , Where have you laid him ? They said to Him , Lord , come and see .
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	The Jews said , See how [ tenderly ] He loved him !
43011037	But some of them said , Could not He Who opened a blind man’s eyes have prevented this man from dying ?
43011038	Now Jesus , again sighing repeatedly and deeply disquieted , approached the tomb . It was a cave ( a hole in the rock ) , and a boulder lay against [ the entrance to close ] it .
43011039	Jesus said , Take away the stone . Martha , the sister of the dead man , exclaimed , But Lord , by this time he [ is decaying and ] throws off an offensive odor , for he has been dead four days !
43011040	Jesus said to her , Did I not tell you and promise you that if you would believe and rely on Me , you would see the glory of God ?
43011041	So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said , Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
43011042	Yes , I know You always hear and listen to Me , but I have said this on account of and for the benefit of the people standing around , so that they may believe that You did send Me [ that You have made Me Your Messenger ] .
43011043	When He had said this , He shouted with a loud voice , Lazarus , come out !
43011044	And out walked the man who had been dead , his hands and feet wrapped in burial cloths ( linen strips ) , and with a [ burial ] napkin bound around his face . Jesus said to them , Free him of the burial wrappings and let him go .
43011045	Upon seeing what Jesus had done , many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed in Him . [ They trusted in Him and adhered to Him and relied on Him . ]
43011046	But some of them went back to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council ( the Sanhedrin ) and said , What are we to do ? For this Man performs many signs ( evidences , miracles ) .
43011048	If we let Him alone to go on like this , everyone will believe in Him and adhere to Him , and the Romans will come and suppress and destroy and take away our [ holy ] place and our nation [ our temple and city and our civil organization ] .
43011049	But one of them , Caiaphas , who was the high priest that year , declared , You know nothing at all !
43011050	Nor do you understand or reason out that it is expedient and better for your own welfare that one man should die on behalf of the people than that the whole nation should perish ( be destroyed , ruined ) .
43011051	Now he did not say this simply of his own accord [ he was not self-moved ] ; but being the high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation ,
43011052	And not only for the nation but also for the purpose of uniting into one body the children of God who have been scattered far and wide .
43011053	So from that day on they took counsel and plotted together how they might put Him to death .
43011054	For that reason Jesus no longer appeared publicly among the Jews , but left there and retired to the district that borders on the wilderness ( the desert ) , to a village called Ephraim , and there He stayed with the disciples .
43011055	Now the Jewish Passover was at hand , and many from the country went up to Jerusalem in order that they might purify and consecrate themselves before the Passover .
43011056	So they kept looking for Jesus and questioned among themselves as they were standing about in the temple [ area ] , What do you think ? Will He not come to the Feast at all ?
43011057	Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was , he should report it to them , so that they might arrest Him .
43012001	SO SIX days before the Passover Feast , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who had died and whom He had raised from the dead .
43012002	So they made Him a supper ; and Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those at the table with Him .
43012003	Mary took a pound of ointment of pure liquid nard [ a rare perfume ] that was very expensive , and she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair . And the whole house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43012004	But Judas Iscariot , the one of His disciples who was about to betray Him , said ,
43012005	Why was this perfume not sold for 300 denarii [ a year’s wages for an ordinary workman ] and that [ money ] given to the poor ( the destitute ) ?
43012006	Now he did not say this because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief ; and having the bag ( the money box , the purse of the Twelve ) , he took for himself what was put into it [ pilfering the collections ] .
43012007	But Jesus said , Let her alone . It was [ intended ] that she should keep it for the time of My preparation for burial . [ She has kept it that she might have it for the time of My embalming . ]
43012008	You always have the poor with you , but you do not always have Me .
43012009	Now a great crowd of the Jews heard that He was at Bethany , and they came there , not only because of Jesus but that they also might see Lazarus , whom He had raised from the dead .
43012010	So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also ,
43012011	Because on account of him many of the Jews were going away [ were withdrawing from and leaving the Judeans ] and believing in and adhering to Jesus .
43012012	The next day a vast crowd of those who had come to the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
43012013	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him . And as they went , they kept shouting , Hosanna ! Blessed is He and praise to Him Who comes in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel !
43012014	And Jesus , having found a young donkey , rode upon it , [ just ] as it is written in the Scriptures ,
43012015	Do not fear , O Daughter of Zion ! Look ! Your King is coming , sitting on a donkey’s colt !
43012016	His disciples did not understand and could not comprehend the meaning of these things at first ; but when Jesus was glorified and exalted , they remembered that these things had been written about Him and had been done to Him .
43012017	The group that had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from among the dead kept telling it [ bearing witness ] to others .
43012018	It was for this reason that the crowd went out to meet Him , because they had heard that He had performed this sign ( proof , miracle ) .
43012019	Then the Pharisees said among themselves , You see how futile your efforts are and how you accomplish nothing . See ! The whole world is running after Him !
43012020	Now among those who went up to worship at the Feast were some Greeks .
43012021	These came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and they made this request , Sir , we desire to see Jesus .
43012022	Philip came and told Andrew ; then Andrew and Philip together [ went ] and told Jesus .
43012023	And Jesus answered them , The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified and exalted .
43012024	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains [ just one grain ; it never becomes more but lives ] by itself alone . But if it dies , it produces many others and yields a rich harvest .
43012025	Anyone who loves his life loses it , but anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal . [ Whoever has no love for , no concern for , no regard for his life here on earth , but despises it , preserves his life forever and ever . ]
43012026	If anyone serves Me , he must continue to follow Me [ to cleave steadfastly to Me , conform wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying ] and wherever I am , there will My servant be also . If anyone serves Me , the Father will honor him .
43012027	Now My soul is troubled and distressed , and what shall I say ? Father , save Me from this hour [ of trial and agony ] ? But it was for this very purpose that I have come to this hour [ that I might undergo it ] .
43012028	[ Rather , I will say , ] Father , glorify ( honor and extol ) Your [ own ] name ! Then there came a voice out of heaven saying , I have already glorified it , and I will glorify it again .
43012029	The crowd of bystanders heard the sound and said that it had thundered ; others said , An angel has spoken to Him !
43012030	Jesus answered , This voice has not come for My sake , but for your sake .
43012031	Now the judgment ( crisis ) of this world is coming on [ sentence is now being passed on this world ] . Now the ruler ( evil genius , prince ) of this world shall be cast out ( expelled ) .
43012032	And I , if and when I am lifted up from the earth [ on the cross ] , will draw and attract all men [ Gentiles as well as Jews ] to Myself .
43012033	He said this to signify in what manner He would die .
43012034	At this the people answered Him , We have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain forever ; how then can You say , The Son of Man must be lifted up [ on the cross ] ? Who is this Son of Man ?
43012035	So Jesus said to them , You will have the Light only a little while longer . Walk while you have the Light [ keep on living by it ] , so that darkness may not overtake and overcome you . He who walks about in the dark does not know where he goes [ he is drifting ] .
43012036	While you have the Light , believe in the Light [ have faith in it , hold to it , rely on it ] , that you may become sons of the Light and be filled with Light . Jesus said these things , and then He went away and hid Himself from them [ was lost to their view ] .
43012037	Even though He had done so many miracles before them ( right before their eyes ) , yet they still did not trust in Him and failed to believe in Him --
43012038	So that what Isaiah the prophet said was fulfilled : Lord , who has believed our report and our message ? And to whom has the arm ( the power ) of the Lord been shown ( unveiled and revealed ) ?
43012039	Therefore they could not believe [ they were unable to believe ] . For Isaiah has also said ,
43012040	He has blinded their eyes and hardened and benumbed their [ callous , degenerated ] hearts [ He has made their minds dull ] , to keep them from seeing with their eyes and understanding with their hearts and minds and repenting and turning to Me to heal them .
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw His glory and spoke of Him .
43012042	And yet [ in spite of all this ] many even of the leading men ( the authorities and the nobles ) believed and trusted in Him . But because of the Pharisees they did not confess it , for fear that [ if they should acknowledge Him ] they would be expelled from the synagogue ;
43012043	For they loved the approval and the praise and the glory that come from men [ instead of and ] more than the glory that comes from God . [ They valued their credit with men more than their credit with God . ]
43012044	But Jesus loudly declared , The one who believes in Me does not [ only ] believe in and trust in and rely on Me , but [ in believing in Me he believes ] in Him Who sent Me .
43012045	And whoever sees Me sees Him Who sent Me .
43012046	I have come as a Light into the world , so that whoever believes in Me [ whoever cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me ] may not continue to live in darkness .
43012047	If anyone hears My teachings and fails to observe them [ does not keep them , but disregards them ] , it is not I who judges him . For I have not come to judge and to condemn and to pass sentence and to inflict penalty on the world , but to save the world .
43012048	Anyone who rejects Me and persistently sets Me at naught , refusing to accept My teachings , has his judge [ however ] ; for the [ very ] message that I have spoken will itself judge and convict him at the last day .
43012049	This is because I have never spoken on My own authority or of My own accord or as self-appointed , but the Father Who sent Me has Himself given Me orders [ concerning ] what to say and what to tell .
43012050	And I know that His commandment is ( means ) eternal life . So whatever I speak , I am saying [ exactly ] what My Father has told Me to say and in accordance with His instructions .
43013001	[ NOW ] BEFORE the Passover Feast began , Jesus knew ( was fully aware ) that the time had come for Him to leave this world and return to the Father . And as He had loved those who were His own in the world , He loved them to the last and to the highest degree .
43013002	So [ it was ] during supper , Satan having already put the thought of betraying Jesus in the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon’s son ,
43013003	[ That ] Jesus , knowing ( fully aware ) that the Father had put everything into His hands , and that He had come from God and was [ now ] returning to God ,
43013004	Got up from supper , took off His garments , and taking a [ servant’s ] towel , He fastened it around His waist .
43013005	Then He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the [ servant’s ] towel with which He was girded .
43013006	When He came to Simon Peter , [ Peter ] said to Him , Lord , are my feet to be washed by You ? [ Is it for You to wash my feet ? ]
43013007	Jesus said to him , You do not understand now what I am doing , but you will understand later on .
43013008	Peter said to Him , You shall never wash my feet ! Jesus answered him , Unless I wash you , you have no part with ( in ) Me [ you have no share in companionship with Me ] .
43013009	Simon Peter said to Him , Lord , [ wash ] not only my feet , but my hands and my head too !
43013010	Jesus said to him , Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet , but is clean all over . And you [ My disciples ] are clean , but not all of you .
43013011	For He knew who was going to betray Him ; that was the reason He said , Not all of you are clean .
43013012	So when He had finished washing their feet and had put on His garments and had sat down again , He said to them , Do you understand what I have done to you ?
43013013	You call Me the Teacher ( Master ) and the Lord , and you are right in doing so , for that is what I am .
43013014	If I then , your Lord and Teacher ( Master ) , have washed your feet , you ought [ it is your duty , you are under obligation , you owe it ] to wash one another’s feet .
43013015	For I have given you this as an example , so that you should do [ in your turn ] what I have done to you .
43013016	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , A servant is not greater than his master , and no one who is sent is superior to the one who sent him .
43013017	If you know these things , blessed and happy and to be envied are you if you practice them [ if you act accordingly and really do them ] .
43013018	I am not speaking of and I do not mean all of you . I know whom I have chosen ; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled , He who eats My bread with Me has raised up his heel against Me .
43013019	I tell you this now before it occurs , so that when it does take place you may be persuaded and believe that I am He [ Who I say I am -- the Christ , the Anointed One , the Messiah ] .
43013020	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , he who receives and welcomes and takes into his heart any messenger of Mine receives Me [ in just that way ] ; and he who receives and welcomes and takes Me into his heart receives Him Who sent Me [ in that same way ] .
43013021	After Jesus had said these things , He was troubled ( disturbed , agitated ) in spirit and said , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , one of you will deliver Me up [ one of you will be false to Me and betray Me ] !
43013022	The disciples kept looking at one another , puzzled as to whom He could mean .
43013023	One of His disciples , whom Jesus loved [ whom He esteemed and delighted in ] , was reclining [ next to Him ] on Jesus’ bosom .
43013024	So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask of whom He was speaking .
43013025	Then leaning back against Jesus’ breast , he asked Him , Lord , who is it ?
43013026	Jesus answered , It is the one to whom I am going to give this morsel ( bit ) of food after I have dipped it . So when He had dipped the morsel of bread [ into the dish ] , He gave it to Judas , Simon Iscariot’s son .
43013027	Then after [ he had taken ] the bit of food , Satan entered into and took possession of [ Judas ] . Jesus said to him , What you are going to do , do more swiftly than you seem to intend and make quick work of it .
43013028	But nobody reclining at the table knew why He spoke to him or what He meant by telling him this .
43013029	Some thought that , since Judas had the money box ( the purse ) , Jesus was telling him , Buy what we need for the Festival , or that he should give something to the poor .
43013030	So after receiving the bit of bread , he went out immediately . And it was night .
43013031	When he had left , Jesus said , Now is the Son of Man glorified ! [ Now He has achieved His glory , His honor , His exaltation ! ] And God has been glorified through and in Him .
43013032	And if God is glorified through and in Him , God will also glorify Him in Himself , and He will glorify Him at once and not delay .
43013033	[ Dear ] little children , I am to be with you only a little longer . You will look for Me and , as I told the Jews , so I tell you now : you are not able to come where I am going .
43013034	I give you a new commandment : that you should love one another . Just as I have loved you , so you too should love one another .
43013035	By this shall all [ men ] know that you are My disciples , if you love one another [ if you keep on showing love among yourselves ] .
43013036	Simon Peter said to Him , Lord , where are You going ? Jesus answered , You are not able to follow Me now where I am going , but you shall follow Me afterwards .
43013037	Peter said to Him , Lord , why cannot I follow You now ? I will lay down my life for You .
43013038	Jesus answered , Will you [ really ] lay down your life for Me ? I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , before a rooster crows , you will deny Me [ completely disown Me ] three times .
43014001	DO NOT let your hearts be troubled ( distressed , agitated ) . You believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely on God ; believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely also on Me .
43014002	In My Father’s house there are many dwelling places ( homes ) . If it were not so , I would have told you ; for I am going away to prepare a place for you .
43014003	And when ( if ) I go and make ready a place for you , I will come back again and will take you to Myself , that where I am you may be also .
43014004	And [ to the place ] where I am going , you know the way .
43014005	Thomas said to Him , Lord , we do not know where You are going , so how can we know the way ?
43014006	Jesus said to him , I am the Way and the Truth and the Life ; no one comes to the Father except by ( through ) Me .
43014007	If you had known Me [ had learned to recognize Me ] , you would also have known My Father . From now on , you know Him and have seen Him .
43014008	Philip said to Him , Lord , show us the Father [ cause us to see the Father -- that is all we ask ] ; then we shall be satisfied .
43014009	Jesus replied , Have I been with all of you for so long a time , and do you not recognize and know Me yet , Philip ? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father . How can you say then , Show us the Father ?
43014010	Do you not believe that I am in the Father , and that the Father is in Me ? What I am telling you I do not say on My own authority and of My own accord ; but the Father Who lives continually in Me does the ( His ) works ( His own miracles , deeds of power ) .
43014011	Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me ; or else believe Me for the sake of the [ very ] works themselves . [ If you cannot trust Me , at least let these works that I do in My Father’s name convince you . ]
43014012	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , if anyone steadfastly believes in Me , he will himself be able to do the things that I do ; and he will do even greater things than these , because I go to the Father .
43014013	And I will do [ I Myself will grant ] whatever you ask in My Name [ as presenting all that I AM ] , so that the Father may be glorified and extolled in ( through ) the Son .
43014014	[ Yes ] I will grant [ I Myself will do for you ] whatever you shall ask in My Name [ as presenting all that I AM ] .
43014015	If you [ really ] love Me , you will keep ( obey ) My commands .
43014016	And I will ask the Father , and He will give you another Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Intercessor , Advocate , Strengthener , and Standby ) , that He may remain with you forever --
43014017	The Spirit of Truth , Whom the world cannot receive ( welcome , take to its heart ) , because it does not see Him or know and recognize Him . But you know and recognize Him , for He lives with you [ constantly ] and will be in you .
43014018	I will not leave you as orphans [ comfortless , desolate , bereaved , forlorn , helpless ] ; I will come [ back ] to you .
43014019	Just a little while now , and the world will not see Me any more , but you will see Me ; because I live , you will live also .
43014020	At that time [ when that day comes ] you will know [ for yourselves ] that I am in My Father , and you [ are ] in Me , and I [ am ] in you .
43014021	The person who has My commands and keeps them is the one who [ really ] loves Me ; and whoever [ really ] loves Me will be loved by My Father , and I [ too ] will love him and will show ( reveal , manifest ) Myself to him . [ I will let Myself be clearly seen by him and make Myself real to him . ]
43014022	Judas , not Iscariot , asked Him , Lord , how is it that You will reveal Yourself [ make Yourself real ] to us and not to the world ?
43014023	Jesus answered , If a person [ really ] loves Me , he will keep My word [ obey My teaching ] ; and My Father will love him , and We will come to him and make Our home ( abode , special dwelling place ) with him .
43014024	Anyone who does not [ really ] love Me does not observe and obey My teaching . And the teaching which you hear and heed is not Mine , but [ comes ] from the Father Who sent Me .
43014025	I have told you these things while I am still with you .
43014026	But the Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Intercessor , Advocate , Strengthener , Standby ) , the Holy Spirit , Whom the Father will send in My name [ in My place , to represent Me and act on My behalf ] , He will teach you all things . And He will cause you to recall ( will remind you of , bring to your remembrance ) everything I have told you .
43014027	Peace I leave with you ; My [ own ] peace I now give and bequeath to you . Not as the world gives do I give to you . Do not let your hearts be troubled , neither let them be afraid . [ Stop allowing yourselves to be agitated and disturbed ; and do not permit yourselves to be fearful and intimidated and cowardly and unsettled . ]
43014028	You heard Me tell you , I am going away and I am coming [ back ] to you . If you [ really ] loved Me , you would have been glad , because I am going to the Father ; for the Father is greater and mightier than I am .
43014029	And now I have told you [ this ] before it occurs , so that when it does take place you may believe and have faith in and rely on Me .
43014030	I will not talk with you much more , for the prince ( evil genius , ruler ) of the world is coming . And he has no claim on Me . [ He has nothing in common with Me ; there is nothing in Me that belongs to him , and he has no power over Me . ]
43014031	But [ Satan is coming and ] I do as the Father has commanded Me , so that the world may know ( be convinced ) that I love the Father and that I do only what the Father has instructed Me to do . [ I act in full agreement with His orders . ] Rise , let us go away from here .
43015001	I AM the True Vine , and My Father is the Vinedresser .
43015002	Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [ that stops bearing ] He cuts away ( trims off , takes away ) ; and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit , to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit .
43015003	You are cleansed and pruned already , because of the word which I have given you [ the teachings I have discussed with you ] .
43015004	Dwell in Me , and I will dwell in you . [ Live in Me , and I will live in you . ] Just as no branch can bear fruit of itself without abiding in ( being vitally united to ) the vine , neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in Me .
43015005	I am the Vine ; you are the branches . Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much ( abundant ) fruit . However , apart from Me [ cut off from vital union with Me ] you can do nothing .
43015006	If a person does not dwell in Me , he is thrown out like a [ broken-off ] branch , and withers ; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire , and they are burned .
43015007	If you live in Me [ abide vitally united to Me ] and My words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts , ask whatever you will , and it shall be done for you .
43015008	When you bear ( produce ) much fruit , My Father is honored and glorified , and you show and prove yourselves to be true followers of Mine .
43015009	I have loved you , [ just ] as the Father has loved Me ; abide in My love [ continue in His love with Me ] .
43015010	If you keep My commandments [ if you continue to obey My instructions ] , you will abide in My love and live on in it , just as I have obeyed My Father’s commandments and live on in His love .
43015011	I have told you these things , that My joy and delight may be in you , and that your joy and gladness may be of full measure and complete and overflowing .
43015012	This is My commandment : that you love one another [ just ] as I have loved you .
43015013	No one has greater love [ no one has shown stronger affection ] than to lay down ( give up ) his own life for his friends .
43015014	You are My friends if you keep on doing the things which I command you to do .
43015015	I do not call you servants ( slaves ) any longer , for the servant does not know what his master is doing ( working out ) . But I have called you My friends , because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from My Father . [ I have revealed to you everything that I have learned from Him . ]
43015016	You have not chosen Me , but I have chosen you and I have appointed you [ I have planted you ] , that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing , and that your fruit may be lasting [ that it may remain , abide ] , so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name [ as presenting all that I AM ] , He may give it to you .
43015017	This is what I command you : that you love one another .
43015018	If the world hates you , know that it hated Me before it hated you .
43015019	If you belonged to the world , the world would treat you with affection and would love you as its own . But because you are not of the world [ no longer one with it ] , but I have chosen ( selected ) you out of the world , the world hates ( detests ) you .
43015020	Remember that I told you , A servant is not greater than his master [ is not superior to him ] . If they persecuted Me , they will also persecute you ; if they kept My word and obeyed My teachings , they will also keep and obey yours .
43015021	But they will do all this to you [ inflict all this suffering on you ] because of [ your bearing ] My name and on My account , for they do not know or understand the One Who sent Me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin [ would be blameless ] ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	Whoever hates Me also hates My Father .
43015024	If I had not done ( accomplished ) among them the works which no one else ever did , they would not be guilty of sin . But [ the fact is ] now they have both seen [ these works ] and have hated both Me and My Father .
43015025	But [ this is so ] that the word written in their Law might be fulfilled , They hated Me without a cause .
43015026	But when the Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Advocate , Intercessor , Strengthener , Standby ) comes , Whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of Truth Who comes ( proceeds ) from the Father , He [ Himself ] will testify regarding Me .
43015027	But you also will testify and be My witnesses , because you have been with Me from the beginning .
43016001	I HAVE told you all these things , so that you should not be offended ( taken unawares and falter , or be caused to stumble and fall away ) . [ I told you to keep you from being scandalized and repelled . ]
43016002	They will put you out of ( expel you from ) the synagogues ; but an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think and claim that he has offered service to God .
43016003	And they will do this because they have not known the Father or Me .
43016004	But I have told you these things now , so that when they occur you will remember that I told you of them . I did not say these things to you from the beginning , because I was with you .
43016005	But now I am going to Him Who sent Me , yet none of you asks Me , Where are You going ?
43016006	But because I have said these things to you , sorrow has filled your hearts [ taken complete possession of them ] .
43016007	However , I am telling you nothing but the truth when I say it is profitable ( good , expedient , advantageous ) for you that I go away . Because if I do not go away , the Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Advocate , Intercessor , Strengthener , Standby ) will not come to you [ into close fellowship with you ] ; but if I go away , I will send Him to you [ to be in close fellowship with you ] .
43016008	And when He comes , He will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin and about righteousness ( uprightness of heart and right standing with God ) and about judgment :
43016009	About sin , because they do not believe in Me [ trust in , rely on , and adhere to Me ] ;
43016010	About righteousness ( uprightness of heart and right standing with God ) , because I go to My Father , and you will see Me no longer ;
43016011	About judgment , because the ruler ( evil genius , prince ) of this world [ Satan ] is judged and condemned and sentence already is passed upon him .
43016012	I have still many things to say to you , but you are not able to bear them or to take them upon you or to grasp them now .
43016013	But when He , the Spirit of Truth ( the Truth-giving Spirit ) comes , He will guide you into all the Truth ( the whole , full Truth ) . For He will not speak His own message [ on His own authority ] ; but He will tell whatever He hears [ from the Father ; He will give the message that has been given to Him ] , and He will announce and declare to you the things that are to come [ that will happen in the future ] .
43016014	He will honor and glorify Me , because He will take of ( receive , draw upon ) what is Mine and will reveal ( declare , disclose , transmit ) it to you .
43016015	Everything that the Father has is Mine . That is what I meant when I said that He [ the Spirit ] will take the things that are Mine and will reveal ( declare , disclose , transmit ) it to you .
43016016	In a little while you will no longer see Me , and again after a short while you will see Me .
43016017	So some of His disciples questioned among themselves , What does He mean when He tells us , In a little while you will no longer see Me , and again after a short while you will see Me , and , Because I go to My Father ?
43016018	What does He mean by a little while ? We do not know or understand what He is talking about .
43016019	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him , so He said to them , Are you wondering and inquiring among yourselves what I meant when I said , In a little while you will no longer see Me , and again after a short while you will see Me ?
43016020	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that you shall weep and grieve , but the world will rejoice . You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
43016021	A woman , when she gives birth to a child , has grief ( anguish , agony ) because her time has come . But when she has delivered the child , she no longer remembers her pain ( trouble , anguish ) because she is so glad that a man ( a child , a human being ) has been born into the world .
43016022	So for the present you are also in sorrow ( in distress and depressed ) ; but I will see you again and [ then ] your hearts will rejoice , and no one can take from you your joy ( gladness , delight ) .
43016023	And when that time comes , you will ask nothing of Me [ you will need to ask Me no questions ] . I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that My Father will grant you whatever you ask in My Name [ as presenting all that I AM ] .
43016024	Up to this time you have not asked a [ single ] thing in My Name [ as presenting all that I AM ] ; but now ask and keep on asking and you will receive , so that your joy ( gladness , delight ) may be full and complete .
43016025	I have told you these things in parables ( veiled language , allegories , dark sayings ) ; the hour is now coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech , but I shall tell you about the Father in plain words and openly ( without reserve ) .
43016026	At that time you will ask ( pray ) in My Name ; and I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf [ for it will be unnecessary ] .
43016027	For the Father Himself [ tenderly ] loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from the Father .
43016028	I came out from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I am leaving the world and going to the Father .
43016029	His disciples said , Ah , now You are speaking plainly to us and not in parables ( veiled language and figures of speech ) !
43016030	Now we know that You are acquainted with everything and have no need to be asked questions . Because of this we believe that you [ really ] came from God .
43016031	Jesus answered them , Do you now believe ? [ Do you believe it at last ? ]
43016032	But take notice , the hour is coming , and it has arrived , when you will all be dispersed and scattered , every man to his own home , leaving Me alone . Yet I am not alone , because the Father is with Me .
43016033	I have told you these things , so that in Me you may have [ perfect ] peace and confidence . In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration ; but be of good cheer [ take courage ; be confident , certain , undaunted ] ! For I have overcome the world . [ I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you . ]
43017001	WHEN JESUS had spoken these things , He lifted up His eyes to heaven and said , Father , the hour has come . Glorify and exalt and honor and magnify Your Son , so that Your Son may glorify and extol and honor and magnify You .
43017002	[ Just as ] You have granted Him power and authority over all flesh ( all humankind ) , [ now glorify Him ] so that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him .
43017003	And this is eternal life : [ it means ] to know ( to perceive , recognize , become acquainted with , and understand ) You , the only true and real God , and [ likewise ] to know Him , Jesus [ as the ] Christ ( the Anointed One , the Messiah ) , Whom You have sent .
43017004	I have glorified You down here on the earth by completing the work that You gave Me to do .
43017005	And now , Father , glorify Me along with Yourself and restore Me to such majesty and honor in Your presence as I had with You before the world existed .
43017006	I have manifested Your Name [ I have revealed Your very Self , Your real Self ] to the people whom You have given Me out of the world . They were Yours , and You gave them to Me , and they have obeyed and kept Your word .
43017007	Now [ at last ] they know and understand that all You have given Me belongs to You [ is really and truly Yours ] .
43017008	For the [ uttered ] words that You gave Me I have given them ; and they have received and accepted [ them ] and have come to know positively and in reality [ to believe with absolute assurance ] that I came forth from Your presence , and they have believed and are convinced that You did send Me .
43017009	I am praying for them . I am not praying ( requesting ) for the world , but for those You have given Me , for they belong to You .
43017010	All [ things that are ] Mine are Yours , and all [ things that are ] Yours belong to Me ; and I am glorified in ( through ) them . [ They have done Me honor ; in them My glory is achieved . ]
43017011	And [ now ] I am no more in the world , but these are [ still ] in the world , and I am coming to You . Holy Father , keep in Your Name [ in the knowledge of Yourself ] those whom You have given Me , that they may be one as We [ are one ] .
43017012	While I was with them , I kept and preserved them in Your Name [ in the knowledge and worship of You ] . Those You have given Me I guarded and protected , and not one of them has perished or is lost except the son of perdition [ Judas Iscariot -- the one who is now doomed to destruction , destined to be lost ] , that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
43017013	And now I am coming to You ; I say these things while I am still in the world , so that My joy may be made full and complete and perfect in them [ that they may experience My delight fulfilled in them , that My enjoyment may be perfected in their own souls , that they may have My gladness within them , filling their hearts ] .
43017014	I have given and delivered to them Your word ( message ) and the world has hated them , because they are not of the world [ do not belong to the world ] , just as I am not of the world .
43017015	I do not ask that You will take them out of the world , but that You will keep and protect them from the evil one .
43017016	They are not of the world ( worldly , belonging to the world ) , [ just ] as I am not of the world .
43017017	Sanctify them [ purify , consecrate , separate them for Yourself , make them holy ] by the Truth ; Your Word is Truth .
43017018	Just as You sent Me into the world , I also have sent them into the world .
43017019	And so for their sake and on their behalf I sanctify ( dedicate , consecrate ) Myself , that they also may be sanctified ( dedicated , consecrated , made holy ) in the Truth .
43017020	Neither for these alone do I pray [ it is not for their sake only that I make this request ] , but also for all those who will ever come to believe in ( trust in , cling to , rely on ) Me through their word and teaching ,
43017021	That they all may be one , [ just ] as You , Father , are in Me and I in You , that they also may be one in Us , so that the world may believe and be convinced that You have sent Me .
43017022	I have given to them the glory and honor which You have given Me , that they may be one [ even ] as We are one :
43017023	I in them and You in Me , in order that they may become one and perfectly united , that the world may know and [ definitely ] recognize that You sent Me and that You have loved them [ even ] as You have loved Me .
43017024	Father , I desire that they also whom You have entrusted to Me [ as Your gift to Me ] may be with Me where I am , so that they may see My glory , which You have given Me [ Your love gift to Me ] ; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world .
43017025	O just and righteous Father , although the world has not known You and has failed to recognize You and has never acknowledged You , I have known You [ continually ] ; and these men understand and know that You have sent Me .
43017026	I have made Your Name known to them and revealed Your character and Your very Self , and I will continue to make [ You ] known , that the love which You have bestowed upon Me may be in them [ felt in their hearts ] and that I [ Myself ] may be in them .
43018001	HAVING SAID these things , Jesus went out with His disciples beyond ( across ) the winter torrent of the Kidron [ in the ravine ] . There was a garden there , which He and His disciples entered .
43018002	And Judas , who was betraying Him and delivering Him up , also knew the place , because Jesus had often retired there with His disciples .
43018003	So Judas , obtaining and taking charge of the band of soldiers and some guards ( attendants ) of the high priests and Pharisees , came there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
43018004	Then Jesus , knowing all that was about to befall Him , went out to them and said , Whom are you seeking ? [ Whom do you want ? ]
43018005	They answered Him , Jesus the Nazarene . Jesus said to them , I am He . Judas , who was betraying Him , was also standing with them .
43018006	When Jesus said to them , I am He , they went backwards ( drew back , lurched backward ) and fell to the ground .
43018007	Then again He asked them , Whom are you seeking ? And they said , Jesus the Nazarene .
43018008	Jesus answered , I told you that I am He . So , if you want Me [ if it is only I for Whom you are looking ] , let these men go their way .
43018009	Thus what He had said was fulfilled and verified , Of those whom You have given Me , I have not lost even one .
43018010	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear . The servant’s name was Malchus .
43018011	Therefore , Jesus said to Peter , Put the sword [ back ] into the sheath ! The cup which My Father has given Me , shall I not drink it ?
43018012	So the troops and their captain and the guards ( attendants ) of the Jews seized Jesus and bound Him ,
43018013	And they brought Him first to Annas , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was the high priest that year .
43018014	It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was expedient and for their welfare that one man should die for ( instead of , in behalf of ) the people .
43018015	Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus . And that disciple was known to the high priest , and so he entered along with Jesus into the court of the palace of the high priest ;
43018016	But Peter was standing outside at the door . So the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door and brought Peter inside .
43018017	Then the maid who was in charge at the door said to Peter , You are not also one of the disciples of this Man , are you ? He said , I am not !
43018018	Now the servants and the guards ( the attendants ) had made a fire of coals , for it was cold , and they were standing and warming themselves . And Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
43018019	Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching .
43018020	Jesus answered him , I have spoken openly to the world . I have always taught in a synagogue and in the temple [ area ] , where the Jews [ habitually ] congregate ( assemble ) ; and I have spoken nothing secretly .
43018021	Why do you ask Me ? Ask those who have heard [ Me ] what I said to them . See ! They know what I said .
43018022	But when He said this , one of the attendants who stood by struck Jesus , saying , Is that how You answer the high priest ?
43018023	Jesus replied , If I have said anything wrong [ if I have spoken abusively , if there was evil in what I said ] tell what was wrong with it . But if I spoke rightly and properly , why do you strike Me ?
43018024	Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	But Simon Peter [ still ] was standing and was warming himself . They said to him , You are not also one of His disciples , are you ? He denied it and said , I am not !
43018026	One of the high priest’s servants , a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off , said , Did I not see you in the garden with Him ?
43018027	And again Peter denied it . And immediately a rooster crowed .
43018028	Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium ( judgment hall , governor’s palace ) . And it was early . They themselves did not enter the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled ( become ceremonially unclean ) , but might be fit to eat the Passover [ supper ] .
43018029	So Pilate went out to them and said , What accusation do you bring against this Man ?
43018030	They retorted , If He were not an evildoer ( criminal ) , we would not have handed Him over to you .
43018031	Pilate said to them , Take Him yourselves and judge and sentence and punish Him according to your [ own ] law . The Jews answered , It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death .
43018032	This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to show ( indicate , predict ) by what manner of death He was to die .
43018033	So Pilate went back again into the judgment hall and called Jesus and asked Him , Are You the King of the Jews ?
43018034	Jesus replied , Are you saying this of yourself [ on your own initiative ] , or have others told you about Me ?
43018035	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Your [ own ] people and nation and their chief priests have delivered You to me . What have You done ?
43018036	Jesus answered , My kingdom ( kingship , royal power ) belongs not to this world . If My kingdom were of this world , My followers would have been fighting to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews . But as it is , My kingdom is not from here ( this world ) ; [ it has no such origin or source ] .
43018037	Pilate said to Him , Then You are a King ? Jesus answered , You say it ! [ You speak correctly ! ] For I am a King . [ Certainly I am a King ! ] This is why I was born , and for this I have come into the world , to bear witness to the Truth . Everyone who is of the Truth [ who is a friend of the Truth , who belongs to the Truth ] hears and listens to My voice .
43018038	Pilate said to Him , What is Truth ? On saying this he went out to the Jews again and told them , I find no fault in Him .
43018039	But it is your custom that I release one [ prisoner ] for you at the Passover . So shall I release for you the King of the Jews ?
43018040	Then they all shouted back again , Not Him [ not this Man ] , but Barabbas ! Now Barabbas was a robber .
43019001	SO THEN Pilate took Jesus and scourged ( flogged , whipped ) Him .
43019002	And the soldiers , having twisted together a crown of thorns , put it on His head , and threw a purple cloak around Him .
43019003	And they kept coming to Him and saying , Hail , King of the Jews ! [ Good health to you ! Peace to you ! Long life to you , King of the Jews ! ] And they struck Him with the palms of their hands .
43019004	Then Pilate went out again and said to them , See , I bring Him out to you , so that you may know that I find no fault ( crime , cause for accusation ) in Him .
43019005	So Jesus came out wearing the thorny crown and purple cloak , and Pilate said to them , See , [ here is ] the Man !
43019006	When the chief priests and attendants ( guards ) saw Him , they cried out , Crucify Him ! Crucify Him ! Pilate said to them , Take Him yourselves and crucify Him , for I find no fault ( crime ) in Him .
43019007	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and according to that law He should die , because He has claimed and made Himself out to be the Son of God .
43019008	So , when Pilate heard this said , he was more alarmed and awestricken and afraid than before .
43019009	He went into the judgment hall again and said to Jesus , Where are You from ? [ To what world do You belong ? ] But Jesus did not answer him .
43019010	So Pilate said to Him , Will You not speak [ even ] to me ? Do You not know that I have power ( authority ) to release You and I have power to crucify You ?
43019011	Jesus answered , You would not have any power or authority whatsoever against ( over ) Me if it were not given you from above . For this reason the sin and guilt of the one who delivered Me over to you is greater .
43019012	Upon this , Pilate wanted ( sought , was anxious ) to release Him , but the Jews kept shrieking , If you release this Man , you are no friend of Caesar ! Anybody who makes himself [ out to be ] a king sets himself up against Caesar [ is a rebel against the emperor ] !
43019013	Hearing this , Pilate brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement [ the Mosaic Pavement , the Stone Platform ] -- in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
43019014	Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover , and it was about the sixth hour ( about twelve o’clock noon ) . He said to the Jews , See , [ here is ] your King !
43019015	But they shouted , Away with Him ! Away with Him ! Crucify Him ! Pilate said to them , Crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar !
43019016	Then he delivered Him over to them to be crucified .
43019017	And they took Jesus and led [ Him ] away ; so He went out , bearing His own cross , to the spot called The Place of the Skull -- in Hebrew it is called Golgotha .
43019018	There they crucified Him , and with Him two others -- one on either side and Jesus between them .
43019019	And Pilate also wrote a title ( an inscription on a placard ) and put it on the cross . And the writing was : Jesus the Nazarene , the King of the Jews .
43019020	And many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , [ and ] in Greek .
43019021	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , Do not write , The King of the Jews , but , He said , I am King of the Jews .
43019022	Pilate replied , What I have written , I have written .
43019023	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took His garments and made four parts , one share for each soldier , and also the tunic ( the long shirtlike undergarment ) . But the tunic was seamless , woven [ in one piece ] from the top throughout .
43019024	So they said to one another , Let us not tear it , but let us cast lots to decide whose it shall be . This was to fulfill the Scripture , They parted My garments among them , and for My clothing they cast lots . So the soldiers did these things .
43019025	But by the cross of Jesus stood His mother , His mother’s sister , Mary the [ wife ] of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	So Jesus , seeing His mother there , and the disciple whom He loved standing near , said to His mother , [ Dear ] woman , See , [ here is ] your son !
43019027	Then He said to the disciple , See , [ here is ] your mother ! And from that hour , the disciple took her into his own [ keeping , own home ] .
43019028	After this , Jesus , knowing that all was now finished ( ended ) , said in fulfillment of the Scripture , I thirst .
43019029	A vessel ( jar ) full of sour wine ( vinegar ) was placed there , so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on [ a stalk , reed of ] hyssop , and held it to [ His ] mouth .
43019030	When Jesus had received the sour wine , He said , It is finished ! And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit .
43019031	Since it was the day of Preparation , in order to prevent the bodies from hanging on the cross on the Sabbath -- for that Sabbath was a very solemn and important one -- the Jews requested Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away .
43019032	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first one , and of the other who had been crucified with Him .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus and they saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .
43019034	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came ( flowed ) out .
43019035	And he who saw it ( the eyewitness ) gives this evidence , and his testimony is true ; and he knows that he tells the truth , that you may believe also .
43019036	For these things took place , that the Scripture might be fulfilled ( verified , carried out ) , Not one of His bones shall be broken ;
43019037	And again another Scripture says , They shall look on Him Whom they have pierced .
43019038	And after this , Joseph of Arimathea -- a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews -- asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus . And Pilate granted him permission . So he came and took away His body .
43019039	And Nicodemus also , who first had come to Jesus by night , came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , [ weighing ] about a hundred pounds .
43019040	So they took Jesus’ body and bound it in linen cloths with the spices ( aromatics ) , as is the Jews’ customary way to prepare for burial .
43019041	Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one had ever [ yet ] been laid .
43019042	So there , because of the Jewish day of Preparation [ and ] since the tomb was near by , they laid Jesus .
43020001	NOW ON the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early , while it was still dark , and saw that the stone had been removed from ( lifted out of the groove across the entrance of ) the tomb .
43020002	So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple , whom Jesus [ tenderly ] loved , and said to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid Him !
43020003	Upon this , Peter and the other disciple came out and they went toward the tomb .
43020004	And they came running together , but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first .
43020005	And stooping down , he saw the linen cloths lying there , but he did not enter .
43020006	Then Simon Peter came up , following him , and went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there ;
43020007	But the burial napkin ( kerchief ) which had been around Jesus’ head , was not lying with the other linen cloths , but was [ still ] rolled up ( wrapped round and round ) in a place by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , went in too ; and he saw and was convinced and believed .
43020009	For as yet they did not know ( understand ) the statement of Scripture that He must rise again from the dead .
43020010	Then the disciples went back again to their homes ( lodging places ) .
43020011	But Mary remained standing outside the tomb sobbing . As she wept , she stooped down [ and looked ] into the tomb .
43020012	And she saw two angels in white sitting there , one at the head and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
43020013	And they said to her , Woman , why are you sobbing ? She told them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid Him .
43020014	On saying this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing [ there ] , but she did not know ( recognize ) that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , Woman , why are you crying [ so ] ? For Whom are you looking ? Supposing that it was the gardener , she replied , Sir , if you carried Him away from here , tell me where you have put Him and I will take Him away .
43020016	Jesus said to her , Mary ! Turning around she said to Him in Hebrew , Rabboni ! -- which means Teacher or Master .
43020017	Jesus said to her , Do not cling to Me [ do not hold Me ] , for I have not yet ascended to the Father . But go to My brethren and tell them , I am ascending to My Father and your Father , and to My God and your God .
43020018	Away came Mary Magdalene , bringing the disciples news ( word ) that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to her .
43020019	Then on that same first day of the week , when it was evening , though the disciples were behind closed doors for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood among them and said , Peace to you !
43020020	So saying , He showed them His hands and His side . And when the disciples saw the Lord , they were filled with joy ( delight , exultation , ecstasy , rapture ) .
43020021	Then Jesus said to them again , Peace to you ! [ Just ] as the Father has sent Me forth , so I am sending you .
43020022	And having said this , He breathed on them and said to them , Receive the Holy Spirit !
43020023	[ Now having received the Holy Spirit , and being led and directed by Him ] if you forgive the sins of anyone , they are forgiven ; if you retain the sins of anyone , they are retained .
43020024	But Thomas , one of the Twelve , called the Twin , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	So the other disciples kept telling him , We have seen the Lord ! But he said to them , Unless I see in His hands the marks made by the nails and put my finger into the nail prints , and put my hand into His side , I will never believe [ it ] .
43020026	Eight days later His disciples were again in the house , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , though they were behind closed doors , and stood among them and said , Peace to you !
43020027	Then He said to Thomas , Reach out your finger here , and see My hands ; and put out your hand and place [ it ] in My side . Do not be faithless and incredulous , but [ stop your unbelief and ] believe !
43020028	Thomas answered Him , My Lord and my God !
43020029	Jesus said to him , Because you have seen Me , Thomas , do you now believe ( trust , have faith ) ? Blessed and happy and to be envied are those who have never seen Me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on Me .
43020030	There are also many other signs and miracles which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book .
43020031	But these are written ( recorded ) in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ ( the Anointed One ) , the Son of God , and that through believing and cleaving to and trusting and relying upon Him you may have life through ( in ) His name [ through Who He is ] .
43021001	AFTER THIS , Jesus let Himself be seen and revealed [ Himself ] again to the disciples , at the Sea of Tiberias . And He did it in this way :
43021002	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas , called the Twin , and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee , also the sons of Zebedee , and two others of His disciples .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , I am going fishing ! They said to him , And we are coming with you ! So they went out and got into the boat , and throughout that night they caught nothing .
43021004	Morning was already breaking when Jesus came to the beach and stood there . However , the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
43021005	So Jesus said to them , Boys ( children ) , you do not have any meat ( fish ) , do you ? [ Have you caught anything to eat along with your bread ? ] They answered Him , No !
43021006	And He said to them , Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find [ some ] . So they cast the net , and now they were not able to haul it in for such a big catch ( mass , quantity ) of fish [ was in it ] .
43021007	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , It is the Lord ! Simon Peter , hearing him say that it was the Lord , put ( girded ) on his upper garment ( his fisherman’s coat , his outer tunic ) -- for he was stripped [ for work ] -- and sprang into the sea .
43021008	And the other disciples came in the small boat , for they were not far from shore , only some hundred yards away , dragging the net full of fish .
43021009	When they got out on land ( the beach ) , they saw a fire of coals there and fish lying on it [ cooking ] , and bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , Bring some of the fish which you have just caught .
43021011	So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to land , full of large fish , 153 of them ; and [ though ] there were so many of them , the net was not torn .
43021012	Jesus said to them , Come [ and ] have breakfast . But none of the disciples ventured or dared to ask Him , Who are You ? because they [ well ] knew that it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , and so also [ with ] the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time that Jesus revealed Himself ( appeared , was manifest ) to the disciples after He had risen from the dead .
43021015	When they had eaten , Jesus said to Simon Peter , Simon , son of John , do you love Me more than these [ others do -- with reasoning , intentional , spiritual devotion , as one loves the Father ] ? He said to Him , Yes , Lord , You know that I love You [ that I have deep , instinctive , personal affection for You , as for a close friend ] . He said to him , Feed My lambs .
43021016	Again He said to him the second time , Simon , son of John , do you love Me [ with reasoning , intentional , spiritual devotion , as one loves the Father ] ? He said to Him , Yes , Lord , You know that I love You [ that I have a deep , instinctive , personal affection for You , as for a close friend ] . He said to him , Shepherd ( tend ) My sheep .
43021017	He said to him the third time , Simon , son of John , do you love Me [ with a deep , instinctive , personal affection for Me , as for a close friend ] ? Peter was grieved ( was saddened and hurt ) that He should ask him the third time , Do you love Me ? And he said to Him , Lord , You know everything ; You know that I love You [ that I have a deep , instinctive , personal affection for You , as for a close friend ] . Jesus said to him , Feed My sheep .
43021018	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , when you were young you girded yourself [ put on your own belt or girdle ] and you walked about wherever you pleased to go . But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will put a girdle around you and carry you where you do not wish to go .
43021019	He said this to indicate by what kind of death Peter would glorify God . And after this , He said to him , Follow Me !
43021020	But Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved , following -- the one who also had leaned back on His breast at the supper and had said , Lord , who is it that is going to betray You ?
43021021	When Peter saw him , he said to Jesus , Lord , what about this man ?
43021022	Jesus said to him , If I want him to stay ( survive , live ) until I come , what is that to you ? [ What concern is it of yours ? ] You follow Me !
43021023	So word went out among the brethren that this disciple was not going to die ; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die , but , If I want him to stay ( survive , live ) till I come , what is that to you ?
43021024	It is this same disciple who is bearing witness to these things and who has recorded ( written ) them ; and we [ well ] know that his testimony is true .
43021025	And there are also many other things which Jesus did . If they should be all recorded one by one [ in detail ] , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain ( have room for ) the books that would be written .
44001001	IN THE former account [ which I prepared ] , O Theophilus , I made [ a continuous report ] dealing with all the things which Jesus began to do and to teach
44001002	Until the day when He ascended , after He through the Holy Spirit had instructed and commanded the apostles ( special messengers ) whom He had chosen .
44001003	To them also He showed Himself alive after His passion ( His suffering in the garden and on the cross ) by [ a series of ] many convincing demonstrations [ unquestionable evidences and infallible proofs ] , appearing to them during forty days and talking [ to them ] about the things of the kingdom of God .
44001004	And while being in their company and eating with them , He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for what the Father had promised , Of which [ He said ] you have heard Me speak .
44001005	For John baptized with water , but not many days from now you shall be baptized with ( placed in , introduced into ) the Holy Spirit .
44001006	So when they were assembled , they asked Him , Lord , is this the time when You will reestablish the kingdom and restore it to Israel ?
44001007	He said to them , It is not for you to become acquainted with and know what time brings [ the things and events of time and their definite periods ] or fixed years and seasons ( their critical niche in time ) , which the Father has appointed ( fixed and reserved ) by His own choice and authority and personal power .
44001008	But you shall receive power ( ability , efficiency , and might ) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you , and you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to the ends ( the very bounds ) of the earth .
44001009	And when He had said this , even as they were looking [ at Him ] , He was caught up , and a cloud received and carried Him away out of their sight .
44001010	And while they were gazing intently into heaven as He went , behold , two men [ dressed ] in white robes suddenly stood beside them ,
44001011	Who said , Men of Galilee , why do you stand gazing into heaven ? This same Jesus , Who was caught away and lifted up from among you into heaven , will return in [ just ] the same way in which you saw Him go into heaven .
44001012	Then [ the disciples ] went back to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , [ only ] a Sabbath day’s journey ( three-quarters of a mile ) away .
44001013	And when they had entered [ the city ] , they mounted [ the stairs ] to the upper room where they were [ indefinitely ] staying -- Peter and John and James and Andrew ; Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew ; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot , and Judas [ son ] of James .
44001014	All of these with their minds in full agreement devoted themselves steadfastly to prayer , [ waiting together ] with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with His brothers .
44001015	Now on one of those days Peter arose among the brethren , the whole number of whom gathered together was about a hundred and twenty .
44001016	Brethren , he said , it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David , about Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus .
44001017	For he was counted among us and received [ by divine allotment ] his portion in this ministry .
44001018	Now this man obtained a piece of land with the [ money paid him as a ] reward for his treachery and wickedness , and falling headlong he burst open in the middle [ of his body ] and all his intestines poured forth .
44001019	And all the residents of Jerusalem became acquainted with the facts , so that they called the piece of land in their own dialect -- Akeldama , that is , Field of Blood .
44001020	For in the book of Psalms it is written , Let his place of residence become deserted and gloomy , and let there be no one to live in it ; and [ again ] , Let another take his position or overseership .
44001021	So one of the [ other ] men who have accompanied us [ apostles ] during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
44001022	From the baptism of John at the outset until the day when He was taken up from among us -- one of these men must join with us and become a witness to testify to His resurrection .
44001023	And they accordingly proposed ( nominated ) two men , Joseph called Barsabbas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
44001024	And they prayed and said , You , Lord , Who know all hearts ( their thoughts , passions , desires , appetites , purposes , and endeavors ) , indicate to us which one of these two You have chosen
44001025	To take the place in this ministry and receive the position of an apostle , from which Judas fell away and went astray to go [ where he belonged ] to his own [ proper ] place .
44001026	And they drew lots [ between the two ] , and the lot fell on Matthias ; and he was added to and counted with the eleven apostles ( special messengers ) .
44002001	AND WHEN the day of Pentecost had fully come , they were all assembled together in one place ,
44002002	When suddenly there came a sound from heaven like the rushing of a violent tempest blast , and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting .
44002003	And there appeared to them tongues resembling fire , which were separated and distributed and which settled on each one of them .
44002004	And they were all filled ( diffused throughout their souls ) with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other ( different , foreign ) languages ( tongues ) , as the Spirit kept giving them clear and loud expression [ in each tongue in appropriate words ] .
44002005	Now there were then residing in Jerusalem Jews , devout and God-fearing men from every country under heaven .
44002006	And when this sound was heard , the multitude came together and they were astonished and bewildered , because each one heard them [ the apostles ] speaking in his own [ particular ] dialect .
44002007	And they were beside themselves with amazement , saying , Are not all these who are talking Galileans ?
44002008	Then how is it that we hear , each of us , in our own ( particular ) dialect to which we were born ?
44002009	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and [ the province of ] Asia ,
44002010	Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and the transient residents from Rome , both Jews and the proselytes [ to Judaism from other religions ] ,
44002011	Cretans and Arabians too -- we all hear them speaking in our own native tongues [ and telling of ] the mighty works of God !
44002012	And all were beside themselves with amazement and were puzzled and bewildered , saying one to another , What can this mean ?
44002013	But others made a joke of it and derisively said , They are simply drunk and full of sweet [ intoxicating ] wine .
44002014	But Peter , standing with the eleven , raised his voice and addressed them : You Jews and all you residents of Jerusalem , let this be [ explained ] to you so that you will know and understand ; listen closely to what I have to say .
44002015	For these men are not drunk , as you imagine , for it is [ only ] the third hour ( about 9:00 a.m. ) of the day ;
44002016	But [ instead ] this is [ the beginning of ] what was spoken through the prophet Joel :
44002017	And it shall come to pass in the last days , God declares , that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all mankind , and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy [ telling forth the divine counsels ] and your young men shall see visions ( divinely granted appearances ) , and your old men shall dream [ divinely suggested ] dreams .
44002018	Yes , and on My menservants also and on My maidservants in those days I will pour out of My Spirit , and they shall prophesy [ telling forth the divine counsels and predicting future events pertaining especially to God’s kingdom ] .
44002019	And I will show wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth beneath , blood and fire and smoking vapor ;
44002020	The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the obvious day of the Lord comes -- that great and notable and conspicuous and renowned [ day ] .
44002021	And it shall be that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord [ invoking , adoring , and worshiping the Lord -- Christ ] shall be saved .
44002022	You men of Israel , listen to what I have to say : Jesus of Nazareth , a Man accredited and pointed out and shown forth and commended and attested to you by God by the mighty works and [ the power of performing ] wonders and signs which God worked through Him [ right ] in your midst , as you yourselves know --
44002023	This Jesus , when delivered up according to the definite and fixed purpose and settled plan and foreknowledge of God , you crucified and put out of the way [ killing Him ] by the hands of lawless and wicked men .
44002024	[ But ] God raised Him up , liberating Him from the pangs of death , seeing that it was not possible for Him to continue to be controlled or retained by it .
44002025	For David says in regard to Him , I saw the Lord constantly before me , for He is at my right hand that I may not be shaken or overthrown or cast down [ from my secure and happy state ] .
44002026	Therefore my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted exceedingly ; moreover , my flesh also will dwell in hope [ will encamp , pitch its tent , and dwell in hope in anticipation of the resurrection ] .
44002027	For You will not abandon my soul , leaving it helpless in Hades ( the state of departed spirits ) , nor let Your Holy One know decay or see destruction [ of the body after death ] .
44002028	You have made known to me the ways of life ; You will enrapture me [ diffusing my soul with joy ] with and in Your presence .
44002029	Brethren , it is permitted me to tell you confidently and with freedom concerning the patriarch David that he both died and was buried , and his tomb is with us to this day .
44002030	Being however a prophet , and knowing that God had sealed to him with an oath that He would set one of his descendants on his throne ,
44002031	He , foreseeing this , spoke [ by foreknowledge ] of the resurrection of the Christ ( the Messiah ) that He was not deserted [ in death ] and left in Hades ( the state of departed spirits ) , nor did His body know decay or see destruction .
44002032	This Jesus God raised up , and of that all we [ His disciples ] are witnesses .
44002033	Being therefore lifted high by and to the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promised [ blessing which is the ] Holy Spirit , He has made this outpouring which you yourselves both see and hear .
44002034	For David did not ascend into the heavens ; yet he himself says , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at My right hand and share My throne
44002035	Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet .
44002036	Therefore let the whole house of Israel recognize beyond all doubt and acknowledge assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ ( the Messiah ) -- this Jesus Whom you crucified .
44002037	Now when they heard this they were stung ( cut ) to the heart , and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles ( special messengers ) , Brethren , what shall we do ?
44002038	And Peter answered them , Repent ( change your views and purpose to accept the will of God in your inner selves instead of rejecting it ) and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of and release from your sins ; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	For the promise [ of the Holy Spirit ] is to and for you and your children , and to and for all that are far away , [ even ] to and for as many as the Lord our God invites and bids to come to Himself .
44002040	And [ Peter ] solemnly and earnestly witnessed ( testified ) and admonished ( exhorted ) with much more continuous speaking and warned ( reproved , advised , encouraged ) them , saying , Be saved from this crooked ( perverse , wicked , unjust ) generation .
44002041	Therefore those who accepted and welcomed his message were baptized , and there were added that day about 3,000 souls .
44002042	And they steadfastly persevered , devoting themselves constantly to the instruction and fellowship of the apostles , to the breaking of bread [ including the Lord’s Supper ] and prayers .
44002043	And a sense of awe ( reverential fear ) came upon every soul , and many wonders and signs were performed through the apostles ( the special messengers ) .
44002044	And all who believed ( who adhered to and trusted in and relied on Jesus Christ ) were united and [ together ] they had everything in common ;
44002045	And they sold their possessions ( both their landed property and their movable goods ) and distributed the price among all , according as any had need .
44002046	And day after day they regularly assembled in the temple with united purpose , and in their homes they broke bread [ including the Lord’s Supper ] . They partook of their food with gladness and simplicity and generous hearts ,
44002047	Constantly praising God and being in favor and goodwill with all the people ; and the Lord kept adding [ to their number ] daily those who were being saved [ from spiritual death ] .
44003001	NOW PETER and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer , the ninth hour ( three o’clock in the afternoon ) ,
44003002	[ When ] a certain man crippled from his birth was being carried along , who was laid each day at that gate of the temple [ which is ] called Beautiful , so that he might beg for charitable gifts from those who entered the temple .
44003003	So when he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple , he asked them to give him a gift .
44003004	And Peter directed his gaze intently at him , and so did John , and said , Look at us !
44003005	And [ the man ] paid attention to them , expecting that he was going to get something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , Silver and gold ( money ) I do not have ; but what I do have , that I give to you : in [ the use of ] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , walk !
44003007	Then he took hold of the man’s right hand with a firm grip and raised him up . And at once his feet and ankle bones became strong and steady ,
44003008	And leaping forth he stood and began to walk , and he went into the temple with them , walking and leaping and praising God .
44003009	And all the people saw him walking about and praising God ,
44003010	And they recognized him as the man who usually sat [ begging ] for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple ; and they were filled with wonder and amazement ( bewilderment , consternation ) over what had occurred to him .
44003011	Now while he [ still ] firmly clung to Peter and John , all the people in utmost amazement ran together and crowded around them in the covered porch ( walk ) called Solomon’s .
44003012	And Peter , seeing it , answered the people , You men of Israel , why are you so surprised and wondering at this ? Why do you keep staring at us , as though by our [ own individual ] power or [ active ] piety we had made this man [ able ] to walk ?
44003013	The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob , the God of our forefathers , has glorified His Servant and Son Jesus [ doing Him this honor ] , Whom you indeed delivered up and denied and rejected and disowned in the presence of Pilate , when he had determined to let Him go .
44003014	But you denied and rejected and disowned the Pure and Holy , the Just and Blameless One , and demanded [ the pardon of ] a murderer to be granted to you .
44003015	But you killed the very Source ( the Author ) of life , Whom God raised from the dead . To this we are witnesses .
44003016	And His name , through and by faith in His name , has made this man whom you see and recognize well and strong . [ Yes ] the faith which is through and by Him [ Jesus ] has given the man this perfect soundness [ of body ] before all of you .
44003017	And now , brethren , I know that you acted in ignorance [ not aware of what you were doing ] , as did your rulers also .
44003018	Thus has God fulfilled what He foretold by the mouth of all the prophets , that His Christ ( the Messiah ) should undergo ill treatment and be afflicted and suffer .
44003019	So repent ( change your mind and purpose ) ; turn around and return [ to God ] , that your sins may be erased ( blotted out , wiped clean ) , that times of refreshing ( of recovering from the effects of heat , of reviving with fresh air ) may come from the presence of the Lord ;
44003020	And that He may send [ to you ] the Christ ( the Messiah ) , Who before was designated and appointed for you -- even Jesus ,
44003021	Whom heaven must receive [ and retain ] until the time for the complete restoration of all that God spoke by the mouth of all His holy prophets for ages past [ from the most ancient time in the memory of man ] .
44003022	Thus Moses said to the forefathers , The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as [ He raised up ] me ; Him you shall listen to and understand by hearing and heed in all things whatever He tells you .
44003023	And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to and understand by hearing and heed that Prophet shall be utterly exterminated from among the people .
44003024	Indeed , all the prophets from Samuel and those who came afterwards , as many as have spoken , also promised and foretold and proclaimed these days .
44003025	You are the descendants ( sons ) of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant which God made and gave to your forefathers , saying to Abraham , And in your Seed ( Heir ) shall all the families of the earth be blessed and benefited .
44003026	It was to you first that God sent His Servant and Son Jesus , when He raised Him up [ provided and gave Him for us ] , to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness and evil ways .
44004001	AND WHILE they [ Peter and John ] were talking to the people , the high priests and the military commander of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them ,
44004002	Being vexed and indignant through and through because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in [ the case of ] Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
44004003	So they laid hands on them ( arrested them ) and put them in prison until the following day , for it was already evening .
44004004	But many of those who heard the message believed ( adhered to and trusted in and relied on Jesus as the Christ ) . And their number grew and came to about 5,000 .
44004005	Then on the following day , their magistrates and elders and scribes were assembled in Jerusalem ,
44004006	Including Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all others who belonged to the high priestly relationship .
44004007	And they set the men in their midst and repeatedly demanded , By what sort of power or by what kind of authority did [ such people as ] you do this [ healing ] ?
44004008	Then Peter , [ because he was ] filled with [ and controlled by ] the Holy Spirit , said to them , Rulers of the people and members of the council ( the Sanhedrin ) ,
44004009	If we are being put on trial [ here ] today and examined concerning a good deed done to benefit a feeble ( helpless ) cripple , by what means this man has been restored to health ,
44004010	Let it be known and understood by all of you , and by the whole house of Israel , that in the name and through the power and authority of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , Whom you crucified , [ but ] Whom God raised from the dead , in Him and by means of Him this man is standing here before you well and sound in body .
44004011	This [ Jesus ] is the Stone which was despised and rejected by you , the builders , but which has become the Head of the corner [ the Cornerstone ] .
44004012	And there is salvation in and through no one else , for there is no other name under heaven given among men by and in which we must be saved .
44004013	Now when they saw the boldness and unfettered eloquence of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and untrained in the schools [ common men with no educational advantages ] , they marveled ; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus .
44004014	And since they saw the man who had been cured standing there beside them , they could not contradict the fact or say anything in opposition .
44004015	But having ordered [ the prisoners ] to go aside out of the council [ chamber ] , they conferred ( debated ) among themselves ,
44004016	Saying , What are we to do with these men ? For that an extraordinary miracle has been performed by ( through ) them is plain to all the residents of Jerusalem , and we cannot deny it .
44004017	But in order that it may not spread further among the people and the nation , let us warn and forbid them with a stern threat to speak any more to anyone in this name [ or about this Person ] .
44004018	[ So ] they summoned them and imperatively instructed them not to converse in any way or teach at all in or about the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John replied to them , Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you and obey you rather than God , you must decide ( judge ) .
44004020	But we [ ourselves ] cannot help telling what we have seen and heard .
44004021	Then when [ the rulers and council members ] had further threatened them , they let them go , not seeing how they could secure a conviction against them because of the people ; for everybody was praising and glorifying God for what had occurred .
44004022	For the man on whom this sign ( miracle ) of healing was performed was more than forty years old .
44004023	After they were permitted to go , [ the apostles ] returned to their own [ company ] and told all that the chief priests and elders had said to them .
44004024	And when they heard it , lifted their voices together with one united mind to God and said , O Sovereign Lord , You are He Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that is in them ,
44004025	Who by the mouth of our forefather David , Your servant and child , said through the Holy Spirit , Why did the heathen ( Gentiles ) become wanton and insolent and rage , and the people imagine and study and plan vain ( fruitless ) things [ that will not succeed ] ?
44004026	The kings of the earth took their stand in array [ for attack ] and the rulers were assembled and combined together against the Lord and against His Anointed ( Christ , the Messiah ) .
44004027	For in this city there actually met and plotted together against Your holy Child and Servant Jesus , Whom You consecrated by anointing , both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and peoples of Israel ,
44004028	To carry out all that Your hand and Your will and purpose had predestined ( predetermined ) should occur .
44004029	And now , Lord , observe their threats and grant to Your bond servants [ full freedom ] to declare Your message fearlessly ,
44004030	While You stretch out Your hand to cure and to perform signs and wonders through the authority and by the power of the name of Your holy Child and Servant Jesus .
44004031	And when they had prayed , the place in which they were assembled was shaken ; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they continued to speak the Word of God with freedom and boldness and courage .
44004032	Now the company of believers was of one heart and soul , and not one of them claimed that anything which he possessed was [ exclusively ] his own , but everything they had was in common and for the use of all .
44004033	And with great strength and ability and power the apostles delivered their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus , and great grace ( loving-kindness and favor and goodwill ) rested richly upon them all .
44004034	Nor was there a destitute or needy person among them , for as many as were owners of lands or houses proceeded to sell them , and one by one they brought ( gave back ) the amount received from the sales
44004035	And laid it at the feet of the apostles ( special messengers ) . Then distribution was made according as anyone had need .
44004036	Now Joseph , a Levite and native of Cyprus who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles , which interpreted means Son of Encouragement ,
44004037	Sold a field which belonged to him and brought the sum of money and laid it at the feet of the apostles .
44005001	BUT A certain man named Ananias with his wife Sapphira sold a piece of property ,
44005002	And with his wife’s knowledge and connivance he kept back and wrongfully appropriated some of the proceeds , bringing only a part and putting it at the feet of the apostles .
44005003	But Peter said , Ananias , why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to and attempt to deceive the Holy Spirit , and should [ in violation of your promise ] withdraw secretly and appropriate to your own use part of the price from the sale of the land ?
44005004	As long as it remained unsold , was it not still your own ? And [ even ] after it was sold , was not [ the money ] at your disposal and under your control ? Why then , is it that you have proposed and purposed in your heart to do this thing ? [ How could you have the heart to do such a deed ? ] You have not [ simply ] lied to men [ playing false and showing yourself utterly deceitful ] but to God .
44005005	Upon hearing these words , Ananias fell down and died . And great dread and terror took possession of all who heard of it .
44005006	And the young men arose and wrapped up [ the body ] and carried it out and buried it .
44005007	Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in , not having learned of what had happened .
44005008	And Peter said to her , Tell me , did you sell the land for so much ? Yes , she said , for so much .
44005009	Then Peter said to her , How could you two have agreed and conspired together to try to deceive the Spirit of the Lord ? Listen ! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door , and they will carry you out [ also ] .
44005010	And instantly she fell down at his feet and died ; and the young men entering found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	And the whole church and all others who heard of these things were appalled [ great awe and strange terror and dread seized them ] .
44005012	Now by the hands of the apostles ( special messengers ) numerous and startling signs and wonders were being performed among the people . And by common consent they all met together [ at the temple ] in the covered porch ( walk ) called Solomon’s .
44005013	And none of those who were not of their number dared to join and associate with them , but the people held them in high regard and praised and made much of them .
44005014	More and more there were being added to the Lord those who believed [ those who acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and devoted themselves to Him joined and gathered with them ] , crowds both of men and of women ,
44005015	So that they [ even ] kept carrying out the sick into the streets and placing them on couches and sleeping pads , [ in the hope ] that as Peter passed by , at least his shadow might fall on some of them .
44005016	And the people gathered also from the towns and hamlets around Jerusalem , bringing the sick and those troubled with foul spirits , and they were all cured .
44005017	But the high priest rose up and all who were his supporters , that is , the party of the Sadducees , and being filled with jealousy and indignation and rage ,
44005018	They seized and arrested the apostles ( special messengers ) and put them in the public jail .
44005019	But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and , leading them out , said ,
44005020	Go , take your stand in the temple courts and declare to the people the whole doctrine concerning this Life ( the eternal life which Christ revealed ) .
44005021	And when they heard this , they accordingly went into the temple about daybreak and began to teach . Now the high priest and his supporters who were with him arrived and called together the council ( Sanhedrin ) , even all the senate of the sons of Israel , and they sent to the prison to have [ the apostles ] brought .
44005022	But when the attendants arrived there , they failed to find them in the jail ; so they came back and reported ,
44005023	We found the prison quite safely locked up and the guards were on duty outside the doors , but when we opened [ it ] , we found no one on the inside .
44005024	Now when the military leader of the temple area and the chief priests heard these facts , they were much perplexed and thoroughly at a loss about them , wondering into what this might grow .
44005025	But some man came and reported to them , saying , Listen ! The men whom you put in jail are standing [ right here ] in the temple and teaching the people !
44005026	Then the military leader went with the attendants and brought [ the prisoners ] , but without violence , for they dreaded the people lest they be stoned by them .
44005027	So they brought them and set them before the council ( Sanhedrin ) . And the high priest examined them by questioning ,
44005028	Saying , We definitely commanded and strictly charged you not to teach in or about this Name ; yet here you have flooded Jerusalem with your doctrine and you intend to bring this Man’s blood upon us .
44005029	Then Peter and the apostles replied , We must obey God rather than men .
44005030	The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus , Whom you killed by hanging Him on a tree ( cross ) .
44005031	God exalted Him to His right hand to be Prince and Leader and Savior and Deliverer and Preserver , in order to grant repentance to Israel and to bestow forgiveness and release from sins .
44005032	And we are witnesses of these things , and the Holy Spirit is also , Whom God has bestowed on those who obey Him .
44005033	Now when they heard this , they were cut to the heart and infuriated and wanted to kill the disciples .
44005034	But a certain Pharisee in the council ( Sanhedrin ) named Gamaliel , a teacher of the Law , highly esteemed by all the people , standing up , ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a little while .
44005035	Then he addressed them [ the council , saying ] : Men of Israel , take care in regard to what you propose to do concerning these men .
44005036	For before our time there arose Theudas , asserting himself to be a person of importance , with whom a number of men allied themselves , about 400 ; but he was killed and all who had listened to and adhered to him were scattered and brought to nothing .
44005037	And after this one rose up Judas the Galilean , [ who led an uprising ] during the time of the census , and drew away a popular following after him ; he also perished and all his adherents were scattered .
44005038	Now in the present case let me say to you , stand off ( withdraw ) from these men and let them alone . For if this doctrine or purpose or undertaking or movement is of human origin , it will fail ( be overthrown and come to nothing ) ;
44005039	But if it is of God , you will not be able to stop or overthrow or destroy them ; you might even be found fighting against God !
44005040	So , convinced by him , they took his advice ; and summoning the apostles , they flogged them and sternly forbade them to speak in or about the name of Jesus , and allowed them to go .
44005041	So they went out from the presence of the council ( Sanhedrin ) , rejoicing that they were being counted worthy [ dignified by the indignity ] to suffer shame and be exposed to disgrace for [ the sake of ] His name .
44005042	Yet [ in spite of the threats ] they never ceased for a single day , both in the temple area and at home , to teach and to proclaim the good news ( Gospel ) of Jesus [ as ] the Christ ( the Messiah ) .
44006001	NOW ABOUT this time , when the number of the disciples was greatly increasing , complaint was made by the Hellenists ( the Greek-speaking Jews ) against the [ native ] Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked and neglected in the daily ministration ( distribution of relief ) .
44006002	So the Twelve [ apostles ] convened the multitude of the disciples and said , It is not seemly or desirable or right that we should have to give up or neglect [ preaching ] the Word of God in order to attend to serving at tables and superintending the distribution of food .
44006003	Therefore select out from among yourselves , brethren , seven men of good and attested character and repute , full of the [ Holy ] Spirit and wisdom , whom we may assign to look after this business and duty .
44006004	But we will continue to devote ourselves steadfastly to prayer and the ministry of the Word .
44006005	And the suggestion pleased the whole assembly , and they selected Stephen , a man full of faith ( a strong and welcome belief that Jesus is the Messiah ) and full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit , and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Parmenas , and Nicolaus , a proselyte ( convert ) from Antioch .
44006006	These they presented to the apostles , who after prayer laid their hands on them .
44006007	And the message of God kept on spreading , and the number of disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem ; and [ besides ] a large number of the priests were obedient to the faith [ in Jesus as the Messiah , through Whom is obtained eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ] .
44006008	Now Stephen , full of grace ( divine blessing and favor ) and power ( strength and ability ) worked great wonders and signs ( miracles ) among the people .
44006009	However , some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen ( freed Jewish slaves ) , as it was called , and [ of the synagogues ] of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and [ the province of ] Asia , arose [ and undertook ] to debate and dispute with Stephen .
44006010	But they were not able to resist the intelligence and the wisdom and [ the inspiration of ] the Spirit with which and by Whom he spoke .
44006011	So they [ secretly ] instigated and instructed men to say , We have heard this man speak , using slanderous and abusive and blasphemous language against Moses and God .
44006012	[ Thus ] they incited the people as well as the elders and the scribes , and they came upon Stephen and arrested him and took him before the council ( Sanhedrin ) .
44006013	And they brought forward false witnesses who asserted , This man never stops making statements against this sacred place and the Law [ of Moses ] ;
44006014	For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will tear down and destroy this place , and will alter the institutions and usages which Moses transmitted to us .
44006015	Then all who sat in the council ( Sanhedrin ) , as they gazed intently at Stephen , saw that his face had the appearance of the face of an angel .
44007001	AND THE high priest asked [ Stephen ] , Are these charges true ?
44007002	And he answered , Brethren and fathers , listen to me ! The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was still in Mesopotamia , before he [ went to ] live in Haran ,
44007003	And He said to him , Leave your own country and your relatives and come into the land ( region ) that I will point out to you .
44007004	So then he went forth from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran . And from there , after his father died , [ God ] transferred him to this country in which you are now dwelling .
44007005	Yet He gave him no inheritable property in it , [ no ] not even enough ground to set his foot on ; but He promised that He would give it to Him for a permanent possession and to his descendants after him , even though [ as yet ] he had no child .
44007006	And this is [ in effect ] what God told him : That his descendants would be aliens ( strangers ) in a land belonging to other people , who would bring them into bondage and ill-treat them 400 years .
44007007	But I will judge the nation to whom they will be slaves , said God , and after that they will escape and come forth and worship Me in this [ very ] place .
44007008	And [ God ] made with Abraham a covenant ( an agreement to be religiously observed ) of which circumcision was the seal . And under these circumstances [ Abraham ] became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day ; and Isaac [ did so ] when he became the father of Jacob , and Jacob [ when each of his sons was born ] , the twelve patriarchs .
44007009	And the patriarchs [ Jacob’s sons ] , boiling with envy and hatred and anger , sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt ; but God was with him ,
44007010	And delivered him from all his distressing afflictions and won him goodwill and favor and wisdom and understanding in the sight of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
44007011	Then there came a famine over all of Egypt and Canaan , with great distress , and our forefathers could find no fodder [ for the cattle ] or vegetable sustenance [ for their households ] .
44007012	But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt , he sent forth our forefathers [ to go there on their ] first trip .
44007013	And on their second visit Joseph revealed himself to his brothers , and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh and his origin and race .
44007014	And Joseph sent an invitation calling to himself Jacob his father and all his kindred , seventy-five persons in all .
44007015	And Jacob went down into Egypt , where he himself died , as did [ also ] our forefathers ;
44007016	And their bodies [ Jacob’s and Joseph’s ] were taken back to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had purchased for a sum of [ silver ] money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	But as the time for the fulfillment of the promise drew near which God had made to Abraham , the [ Hebrew ] people increased and multiplied in Egypt ,
44007018	Until [ the time when ] there arose over Egypt another and a different king who did not know Joseph [ neither knowing his history and services nor recognizing his merits ] .
44007019	He dealt treacherously with and defrauded our race ; he abused and oppressed our forefathers , forcing them to expose their babies so that they might not be kept alive .
44007020	At this juncture Moses was born , and was exceedingly beautiful in God’s sight . For three months he was nurtured in his father’s house ;
44007021	Then when he was exposed [ to perish ] , the daughter of Pharaoh rescued him and took him and reared him as her own son .
44007022	So Moses was educated in all the wisdom and culture of the Egyptians , and he was mighty ( powerful ) in his speech and deeds .
44007023	And when he was in his fortieth year , it came into his heart to visit his kinsmen the children of Israel [ to help them and to care for them ] .
44007024	And on seeing one of them being unjustly treated , he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian and slaying [ him ] .
44007025	He expected his brethren to understand that God was granting them deliverance by his hand [ taking it for granted that they would accept him ] ; but they did not understand .
44007026	Then on the next day he suddenly appeared to some who were quarreling and fighting among themselves , and he urged them to make peace and become reconciled , saying , Men , you are brethren ; why do you abuse and wrong one another ?
44007027	Whereupon the man who was abusing his neighbor pushed [ Moses ] aside , saying , Who appointed you a ruler ( umpire ) and a judge over us ?
44007028	Do you intend to slay me as you slew the Egyptian yesterday ?
44007029	At that reply Moses sought safety by flight and he was an exile and an alien in the country of Midian , where he became the father of two sons .
44007030	And when forty years had gone by , there appeared to him in the wilderness ( desert ) of Mount Sinai an angel , in the flame of a burning bramblebush .
44007031	When Moses saw it , he was astonished and marveled at the sight ; but when he went close to investigate , there came to him the voice of the Lord , saying ,
44007032	I am the God of your forefathers , the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob . And Moses trembled and was so terrified that he did not venture to look .
44007033	Then the Lord said to him , Remove the sandals from your feet , for the place where you are standing is holy ground and worthy of veneration .
44007034	Because I have most assuredly seen the abuse and oppression of My people in Egypt and have heard their sighing and groaning , I have come down to rescue them . So , now come ! I will send you back to Egypt [ as My messenger ] .
44007035	It was this very Moses whom they had denied ( disowned and rejected ) , saying , Who made you our ruler ( referee ) and judge ? whom God sent to be a ruler and deliverer and redeemer , by and with the [ protecting and helping ] hand of the Angel that appeared to him in the bramblebush .
44007036	He it was who led them forth , having worked wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and during the forty years in the wilderness ( desert ) .
44007037	It was this [ very ] Moses who said to the children of Israel , God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your brethren as He raised me up .
44007038	This is he who in the assembly in the wilderness ( desert ) was the go-between for the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and our forefathers , and he received living oracles ( words that still live ) to be handed down to us .
44007039	[ And yet ] our forefathers determined not to be subject to him [ refusing to listen to or obey him ] ; but thrusting him aside they rejected him , and in their hearts yearned for and turned back to Egypt .
44007040	And they said to Aaron , Make us gods who shall [ be our leaders and ] go before us ; as for this Moses who led us forth from the land of Egypt -- we have no knowledge of what has happened to him .
44007041	And they [ even ] made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice to the idol and made merry and exulted in the work of their [ own ] hands .
44007042	But God turned [ away from them ] and delivered them up to worship and serve the host ( stars ) of heaven , as it is written in the book of the prophets : Did you [ really ] offer to Me slain beasts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness ( desert ) , O house of Israel ?
44007043	[ No ! ] You took up the tent ( the portable temple ) of Moloch and carried it [ with you ] , and the star of the god Rephan , the images which you [ yourselves ] made that you might worship them ; and I will remove you [ carrying you away into exile ] beyond Babylon .
44007044	Our forefathers had the tent ( tabernacle ) of witness in the wilderness , even as He Who directed Moses to make it had ordered , according to the pattern and model he had seen .
44007045	Our forefathers in turn brought it [ this tent of witness ] in [ with them into the land ] with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations which God drove out before the face of our forefathers . [ So it remained here ] until the time of David ,
44007046	Who found grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) in the sight of God and prayed that he might be allowed to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But it was Solomon who built a house for Him . [ I Kings 6 . ]
44007048	However , the Most High does not dwell in houses and temples made with hands ; as the prophet says ,
44007049	Heaven [ is ] My throne , and earth the footstool for My feet . What [ kind of ] house can you build for Me , says the Lord , or what is the place in which I can rest ?
44007050	Was it not My hand that made all these things ?
44007051	You stubborn and stiff-necked people , still heathen and uncircumcised in heart and ears , you are always actively resisting the Holy Spirit . As your forefathers [ were ] , so you [ are and so you do ] !
44007052	Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute ? And they slew those who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Righteous One , Whom you now have betrayed and murdered --
44007053	You who received the Law as it was ordained and set in order and delivered by angels , and [ yet ] you did not obey it !
44007054	Now upon hearing these things , they [ the Jews ] were cut to the heart and infuriated , and they ground their teeth against [ Stephen ] .
44007055	But he , full of the Holy Spirit and controlled by Him , gazed into heaven and saw the glory ( the splendor and majesty ) of God , and Jesus standing at God’s right hand ;
44007056	And he said , Look ! I see the heavens opened , and the Son of man standing at God’s right hand !
44007057	But they raised a great shout and put their hands over their ears and rushed together upon him .
44007058	Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him , and the witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	And while they were stoning Stephen , he prayed , Lord Jesus , receive and accept and welcome my spirit !
44007060	And falling on his knees , he cried out loudly , Lord , fix not this sin upon them [ lay it not to their charge ] ! And when he had said this , he fell asleep [ in death ] .
44008001	AND SAUL was [ not only ] consenting to [ Stephen’s ] death [ he was pleased and entirely approving ] . On that day a great and severe persecution broke out against the church which was in Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria , except the apostles ( special messengers ) .
44008002	[ A party of ] devout men with others helped to carry out and bury Stephen and made great lamentation over him .
44008003	But Saul shamefully treated and laid waste the church continuously [ with cruelty and violence ] ; and entering house after house , he dragged out men and women and committed them to prison .
44008004	Now those who were scattered abroad went about [ through the land from place to place ] preaching the glad tidings , the Word [ the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] .
44008005	Philip [ the deacon , not the apostle ] went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ ( the Messiah ) to them [ the people ] ;
44008006	And great crowds of people with one accord listened to and heeded what was said by Philip , as they heard him and watched the miracles and wonders which he kept performing [ from time to time ] .
44008007	For foul spirits came out of many who were possessed by them , screaming and shouting with a loud voice , and many who were suffering from palsy or were crippled were restored to health .
44008008	And there was great rejoicing in that city .
44008009	But there was a man named Simon , who had formerly practiced magic arts in the city to the utter amazement of the Samaritan nation , claiming that he himself was an extraordinary and distinguished person .
44008010	They all paid earnest attention to him , from the least to the greatest , saying , This man is that exhibition of the power of God which is called great ( intense ) .
44008011	And they were attentive and made much of him , because for a long time he had amazed and bewildered and dazzled them with his skill in magic arts .
44008012	But when they believed the good news ( the Gospel ) about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) as Philip preached it , they were baptized , both men and women .
44008013	Even Simon himself believed [ he adhered to , trusted in , and relied on the teaching of Philip ] , and after being baptized , devoted himself constantly to him . And seeing signs and miracles of great power which were being performed , he was utterly amazed .
44008014	Now when the apostles ( special messengers ) at Jerusalem heard that [ the country of ] Samaria had accepted and welcomed the Word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
44008015	And they came down and prayed for them that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit ;
44008016	For He had not yet fallen upon any of them , but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then [ the apostles ] laid their hands on them one by one , and they received the Holy Spirit .
44008018	However , when Simon saw that the [ Holy ] Spirit was imparted through the laying on of the apostles’ hands , he brought money and offered it to them ,
44008019	Saying , Grant me also this power and authority , in order that anyone on whom I place my hands may receive the Holy Spirit .
44008020	But Peter said to him , Destruction overtake your money and you , because you imagined you could obtain the [ free ] gift of God with money !
44008021	You have neither part nor lot in this matter , for your heart is all wrong in God’s sight [ it is not straightforward or right or true before God ] .
44008022	So repent of this depravity and wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that , if possible , this contriving thought and purpose of your heart may be removed and disregarded and forgiven you .
44008023	For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in a bond forged by iniquity [ to fetter souls ] .
44008024	And Simon answered , Pray for me [ beseech the Lord , both of you ] , that nothing of what you have said may befall me !
44008025	Now when [ the apostles ] had borne their testimony and preached the message of the Lord , they went back to Jerusalem , proclaiming the glad tidings ( Gospel ) to many villages of the Samaritans [ on the way ] .
44008026	But an angel of the Lord said to Philip , Rise and proceed southward or at midday on the road that runs from Jerusalem down to Gaza . This is the desert [ route ] .
44008027	So he got up and went . And behold , an Ethiopian , a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians , who was in charge of all her treasure , had come to Jerusalem to worship .
44008028	And he was [ now ] returning , and sitting in his chariot he was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	Then the [ Holy ] Spirit said to Philip , Go forward and join yourself to this chariot .
44008030	Accordingly Philip , running up to him , heard [ the man ] reading the prophet Isaiah and asked , Do you really understand what you are reading ?
44008031	And he said , How is it possible for me to do so unless someone explains it to me and guides me [ in the right way ] ? And he earnestly requested Philip to come up and sit beside him .
44008032	Now this was the passage of Scripture which he was reading : Like a sheep He was led to the slaughter , and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb , so He opens not His mouth .
44008033	In His humiliation He was taken away by distressing and oppressive judgment and justice was denied Him [ caused to cease ] . Who can describe or relate in full the wickedness of His contemporaries ( generation ) ? For His life is taken from the earth and a bloody death inflicted upon Him .
44008034	And the eunuch said to Philip , I beg of you , tell me about whom does the prophet say this , about himself or about someone else ?
44008035	Then Philip opened his mouth , and beginning with this portion of Scripture he announced to him the glad tidings ( Gospel ) of Jesus and about Him .
44008036	And as they continued along on the way , they came to some water , and the eunuch exclaimed , See , [ here is ] water ! What is to hinder my being baptized ?
44008037	And Philip said , If you believe with all your heart [ if you have a conviction , full of joyful trust , that Jesus is the Messiah and accept Him as the Author of your salvation in the kingdom of God , giving Him your obedience , then ] you may . And he replied , I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God .
44008038	And he ordered that the chariot be stopped ; and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water , and [ Philip ] baptized him .
44008039	And when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord [ suddenly ] caught away Philip ; and the eunuch saw him no more , and he went on his way rejoicing .
44008040	But Philip was found at Azotus , and passing on he preached the good news ( Gospel ) to all the towns until he reached Caesarea .
44009001	MEANWHILE SAUL , still drawing his breath hard from threatening and murderous desire against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest
44009002	And requested of him letters to the synagogues at Damascus [ authorizing him ] , so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way [ of life as determined by faith in Jesus Christ ] , he might bring them bound [ with chains ] to Jerusalem .
44009003	Now as he traveled on , he came near to Damascus , and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him ,
44009004	And he fell to the ground . Then he heard a voice saying to him , Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting Me [ harassing , troubling , and molesting Me ] ?
44009005	And Saul said , Who are You , Lord ? And He said , I am Jesus , Whom you are persecuting . It is dangerous and it will turn out badly for you to keep kicking against the goad [ to offer vain and perilous resistance ] .
44009006	Trembling and astonished he asked , Lord , what do You desire me to do ? The Lord said to him , But arise and go into the city , and you will be told what you must do .
44009007	The men who were accompanying him were unable to speak [ for terror ] , hearing the voice but seeing no one .
44009008	Then Saul got up from the ground , but though his eyes were opened , he could see nothing ; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus .
44009009	And he was unable to see for three days , and he neither ate nor drank [ anything ] .
44009010	Now there was in Damascus a disciple named Ananias . The Lord said to him in a vision , Ananias . And he answered , Here am I , Lord .
44009011	And the Lord said to him , Get up and go to the street called Straight and ask at the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul , for behold , he is praying [ there ] .
44009012	And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias enter and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight .
44009013	But Ananias answered , Lord , I have heard many people tell about this man , especially how much evil and what great suffering he has brought on Your saints at Jerusalem ;
44009014	Now he is here and has authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call upon Your name .
44009015	But the Lord said to him , Go , for this man is a chosen instrument of Mine to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the descendants of Israel ;
44009016	For I will make clear to him how much he will be afflicted and must endure and suffer for My name’s sake .
44009017	So Ananias left and went into the house . And he laid his hands on Saul and said , Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus , Who appeared to you along the way by which you came here , has sent me that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit .
44009018	And instantly something like scales fell from [ Saul’s ] eyes , and he recovered his sight . Then he arose and was baptized ,
44009019	And after he took some food , he was strengthened . For several days [ afterward ] he remained with the disciples at Damascus .
44009020	And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus , saying , He is the Son of God !
44009021	And all who heard him were amazed and said , Is not this the very man who harassed and overthrew and destroyed in Jerusalem those who called upon this Name ? And he has come here for the express purpose of arresting them and bringing them in chains before the chief priests .
44009022	But Saul increased all the more in strength , and continued to confound and put to confusion the Jews who lived in Damascus by comparing and examining evidence and proving that Jesus is the Christ ( the Messiah ) .
44009023	After considerable time had elapsed , the Jews conspired to put Saul out of the way by slaying him ,
44009024	But [ the knowledge of ] their plot was made known to Saul . They were guarding the [ city’s ] gates day and night to kill him ,
44009025	But his disciples took him at night and let him down through the [ city’s ] wall , lowering him in a basket or hamper .
44009026	And when he had arrived in Jerusalem , he tried to associate himself with the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , for they did not believe he really was a disciple .
44009027	However , Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles , and he explained to them how along the way he had seen the Lord , Who spoke to him , and how at Damascus he had preached freely and confidently and courageously in the name of Jesus .
44009028	So he went in and out [ as one ] among them at Jerusalem ,
44009029	Preaching freely and confidently and boldly in the name of the Lord . And he spoke and discussed with and disputed against the Hellenists ( the Grecian Jews ) , but they were seeking to slay him .
44009030	And when the brethren found it out , they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus [ his home town ] .
44009031	So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was edified [ growing in wisdom , virtue , and piety ] and walking in the respect and reverential fear of the Lord and in the consolation and exhortation of the Holy Spirit , continued to increase and was multiplied .
44009032	Now as Peter went here and there among them all , he went down also to the saints who lived at Lydda .
44009033	There he found a man named Aeneas , who had been bedfast for eight years and was paralyzed .
44009034	And Peter said to him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) [ now ] makes you whole . Get up and make your bed ! And immediately [ Aeneas ] stood up .
44009035	Then all the inhabitants of Lydda and the plain of Sharon saw [ what had happened to ] him and they turned to the Lord .
44009036	Now there was at Joppa a disciple [ a woman ] named [ in Aramaic ] Tabitha , which [ in Greek ] means Dorcas . She was abounding in good deeds and acts of charity .
44009037	About that time she fell sick and died , and when they had cleansed her , they laid [ her ] in an upper room .
44009038	Since Lydda was near Joppa [ however ] , the disciples , hearing that Peter was there , sent two men to him begging him , Do come to us without delay .
44009039	So Peter [ immediately ] rose and accompanied them . And when he had arrived , they took him to the upper room . All the widows stood around him , crying and displaying undershirts ( tunics ) and [ other ] garments such as Dorcas was accustomed to make while she was with them .
44009040	But Peter put them all out [ of the room ] and knelt down and prayed ; then turning to the body he said , Tabitha , get up ! And she opened her eyes ; and when she saw Peter , she raised herself and sat upright .
44009041	And he gave her his hand and lifted her up . Then calling in God’s people and the widows , he presented her to them alive .
44009042	And this became known throughout all Joppa , and many came to believe on the Lord [ to adhere to and trust in and rely on Him as the Christ and as their Savior ] .
44009043	And Peter remained in Joppa for considerable time with a certain Simon a tanner .
44010001	NOW [ living ] at Caesarea there was a man whose name was Cornelius , a centurion ( captain ) of what was known as the Italian Regiment ,
44010002	A devout man who venerated God and treated Him with reverential obedience , as did all his household ; and he gave much alms to the people and prayed continually to God .
44010003	About the ninth hour ( about 3:00 p.m. ) of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God entering and saying to him , Cornelius !
44010004	And he , gazing intently at him , became frightened and said , What is it , Lord ? And the angel said to him , Your prayers and your [ generous ] gifts to the poor have come up [ as a sacrifice ] to God and have been remembered by Him .
44010005	And now send men to Joppa and have them call for and invite here a certain Simon whose surname is Peter ;
44010006	He is lodging with Simon a tanner , whose house is by the seaside .
44010007	When the angel who spoke to him had left , Cornelius called two of his servants and a God-fearing soldier from among his own personal attendants .
44010008	And having rehearsed everything to them , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	The next day as they were still on their way and were approaching the town , Peter went up to the roof of the house to pray , about the sixth hour ( noon ) .
44010010	But he became very hungry , and wanted something to eat ; and while the meal was being prepared a trance came over him ,
44010011	And he saw the sky opened and something like a great sheet lowered by the four corners , descending to the earth .
44010012	It contained all kinds of quadrupeds and wild beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the air .
44010013	And there came a voice to him , saying , Rise up , Peter , kill and eat .
44010014	But Peter said , No , by no means , Lord ; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unhallowed or [ ceremonially ] unclean .
44010015	And the voice came to him again a second time , What God has cleansed and pronounced clean , do not you defile and profane by regarding and calling common and unhallowed or unclean .
44010016	This occurred three times ; then immediately the sheet was taken up to heaven .
44010017	Now Peter was still inwardly perplexed and doubted as to what the vision which he had seen could mean , when [ just then ] behold the messengers that were sent by Cornelius , who had made inquiry for Simon’s house , stopped and stood before the gate .
44010018	And they called out to inquire whether Simon who was surnamed Peter was staying there .
44010019	And while Peter was earnestly revolving the vision in his mind and meditating on it , the [ Holy ] Spirit said to him , Behold , three men are looking for you !
44010020	Get up and go below and accompany them without any doubt [ about its legality ] or any discrimination or hesitation , for I have sent them .
44010021	Then Peter went down to the men and said , I am the man you seek ; what is the purpose of your coming ?
44010022	And they said , Cornelius , a centurion ( captain ) who is just and upright and in right standing with God , being God-fearing and obedient and well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation , has been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house ; and he has received in answer [ to prayer ] a warning to listen to and act upon what you have to say .
44010023	So Peter invited them in to be his guests [ for the night ] . The next day he arose and went away with them , and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
44010024	And on the following day they entered Caesarea . Cornelius was waiting for and expecting them , and he had invited together his relatives and his intimate friends .
44010025	As Peter arrived , Cornelius met him , and falling down at his feet he made obeisance and paid worshipful reverence to him .
44010026	But Peter raised him up , saying , Get up ; I myself am also a man .
44010027	And as [ Peter ] spoke with him , he entered the house and found a large group of persons assembled ;
44010028	And he said to them , You yourselves are aware how it is not lawful or permissible for a Jew to keep company with or to visit or [ even ] to come near or to speak first to anyone of another nationality , but God has shown and taught me by words that I should not call any human being common or unhallowed or [ ceremonially ] unclean .
44010029	Therefore when I was sent for , I came without hesitation or objection or misgivings . So now I ask for what reason you sent for me .
44010030	And Cornelius said , This is now the fourth day since about this time I was observing the ninth hour ( three o’clock in the afternoon ) of prayer in my lodging place ; [ suddenly ] a man stood before me in dazzling apparel ,
44010031	And he said , Cornelius , your prayer has been heard and harkened to , and your donations to the poor have been known and preserved before God [ so that He heeds and is about to help you ] .
44010032	Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is surnamed Peter ; he is staying in the house of Simon the tanner by the seaside .
44010033	So at once I sent for you , and you [ being a Jew ] have done a kind and courteous and handsome thing in coming . Now then , we are all present in the sight of God to listen to all that you have been instructed by the Lord to say .
44010034	And Peter opened his mouth and said : Most certainly and thoroughly I now perceive and understand that God shows no partiality and is no respecter of persons ,
44010035	But in every nation he who venerates and has a reverential fear for God , treating Him with worshipful obedience and living uprightly , is acceptable to Him and sure of being received and welcomed [ by Him ] .
44010036	You know the contents of the message which He sent to Israel , announcing the good news ( Gospel ) of peace by Jesus Christ , Who is Lord of all --
44010037	The [ same ] message which was proclaimed throughout all Judea , starting from Galilee after the baptism preached by John --
44010038	How God anointed and consecrated Jesus of Nazareth with the [ Holy ] Spirit and with strength and ability and power ; how He went about doing good and , in particular , curing all who were harassed and oppressed by [ the power of ] the devil , for God was with Him .
44010039	And we are [ eye and ear ] witnesses of everything that He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem . And [ yet ] they put Him out of the way ( murdered Him ) by hanging Him on a tree ;
44010040	But God raised Him to life on the third day and caused Him to be manifest ( to be plainly seen ) ,
44010041	Not by all the people but to us who were chosen ( designated ) beforehand by God as witnesses , who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead .
44010042	And He charged us to preach to the people and to bear solemn testimony that He is the God-appointed and God-ordained Judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	To Him all the prophets testify ( bear witness ) that everyone who believes in Him [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him , giving himself up to Him ] receives forgiveness of sins through His name .
44010044	While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message .
44010045	And the believers from among the circumcised [ the Jews ] who came with Peter were surprised and amazed , because the free gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed and poured out largely even on the Gentiles .
44010046	For they heard them talking in [ unknown ] tongues ( languages ) and extolling and magnifying God . Then Peter asked ,
44010047	Can anyone forbid or refuse water for baptizing these people , seeing that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have ?
44010048	And he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . Then they begged him to stay on there for some days .
44011001	NOW THE apostles ( special messengers ) and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard [ with astonishment ] that the Gentiles ( heathen ) also had received and accepted and welcomed the Word of God [ the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] .
44011002	So when Peter went up to Jerusalem , the circumcision party [ certain Jewish Christians ] found fault with him [ separating themselves from him in a hostile spirit , opposing and disputing and contending with him ] ,
44011003	Saying , Why did you go to uncircumcised men and [ even ] eat with them ?
44011004	But Peter began [ at the beginning ] and narrated and explained to them step by step [ the whole list of events ] . He said :
44011005	I was in the town of Joppa praying , and [ falling ] in a trance I saw a vision of something coming down from heaven , like a huge sheet lowered by the four corners ; and it descended until it came to me .
44011006	Gazing intently and closely at it , I observed in it [ a variety of ] four-footed animals and wild beasts and reptiles of the earth and birds of the air ,
44011007	And I heard a voice saying to me , Get up , Peter ; kill and eat .
44011008	But I said , No , by no means , Lord ; for nothing common or unhallowed or [ ceremonially ] unclean has ever entered my mouth .
44011009	But the voice answered a second time from heaven , What God has cleansed and pronounced clean , do not you defile and profane by regarding or calling it common or unhallowed or unclean .
44011010	This occurred three times , and then all was drawn up again into heaven .
44011011	And right then the three men sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house in which we were .
44011012	And the [ Holy ] Spirit instructed me to accompany them without [ the least ] hesitation or misgivings or discrimination . So these six brethren accompanied me also , and we went into the man’s house .
44011013	And he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house which stood and said to him , Send men to Joppa and bring Simon who is surnamed Peter ;
44011014	He will give and explain to you a message by means of which you and all your household [ as well ] will be saved [ from eternal death ] .
44011015	When I began to speak , the Holy Spirit fell on them just as He did on us at the beginning .
44011016	Then I recalled the declaration of the Lord , how He said , John indeed baptized with water , but you shall be baptized with ( be placed in , introduced into ) the Holy Spirit .
44011017	If then God gave to them the same Gift [ equally ] as He gave to us when we believed in ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on ) the Lord Jesus Christ , who was I and what power or authority had I to interfere or hinder or forbid or withstand God ?
44011018	When they heard this , they were quieted and made no further objection . And they glorified God , saying , Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance unto [ real ] life [ after resurrection ] .
44011019	Meanwhile those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen had traveled as far away as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch , without delivering the message [ concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] to anyone except Jews .
44011020	But there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , who on returning to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also , proclaiming [ to them ] the good news ( the Gospel ) about the Lord Jesus .
44011021	And the presence of the Lord was with them with power , so that a great number [ learned ] to believe ( to adhere to and trust in and rely on the Lord ) and turned and surrendered themselves to Him .
44011022	The rumors of this came to the ears of the church ( assembly ) in Jerusalem , and they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When he arrived and saw what grace ( favor ) God was bestowing upon them , he was full of joy ; and he continuously exhorted ( warned , urged , and encouraged ) them all to cleave unto and remain faithful to and devoted to the Lord with [ resolute and steady ] purpose of heart .
44011024	For he was a good man [ good in himself and also at once for the good and the advantage of other people ] , full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit and full of faith ( of his belief that Jesus is the Messiah , through Whom we obtain eternal salvation ) . And a large company was added to the Lord .
44011025	[ Barnabas ] went on to Tarsus to hunt for Saul .
44011026	And when he had found him , he brought him back to Antioch . For a whole year they assembled together with and were guests of the church and instructed a large number of people ; and in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians .
44011027	And during these days prophets ( inspired teachers and interpreters of the divine will and purpose ) came down from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	And one of them named Agabus stood up and prophesied through the [ Holy ] Spirit that a great and severe famine would come upon the whole world . And this did occur during the reign of Claudius .
44011029	So the disciples resolved to send relief , each according to his individual ability [ in proportion as he had prospered ] , to the brethren who lived in Judea .
44011030	And so they did , sending [ their contributions ] to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	ABOUT THAT time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict and oppress and torment some who belonged to the church ( assembly ) .
44012002	And he killed James the brother of John with a sword ;
44012003	And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews , he proceeded further and arrested Peter also . This was during the days of Unleavened Bread [ the Passover week ] .
44012004	And when he had seized [ Peter ] , he put him in prison and delivered him to four squads of soldiers of four each to guard him , purposing after the Passover to bring him forth to the people .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison , but fervent prayer for him was persistently made to God by the church ( assembly ) .
44012006	The very night before Herod was about to bring him forth , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , fastened with two chains , and sentries before the door were guarding the prison .
44012007	And suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared [ standing beside him ] , and a light shone in the place where he was . And the angel gently smote Peter on the side and awakened him , saying , Get up quickly ! And the chains fell off his hands .
44012008	And the angel said to him , Tighten your belt and bind on your sandals . And he did so . And he said to him , Wrap your outer garment around you and follow me .
44012009	And [ Peter ] went out [ along ] following him , and he was not conscious that what was apparently being done by the angel was real , but thought he was seeing a vision .
44012010	When they had passed through the first guard and the second , they came to the iron gate which leads into the city . Of its own accord [ the gate ] swung open , and they went out and passed on through one street ; and at once the angel left him .
44012011	Then Peter came to himself and said , Now I really know and am sure that the Lord has sent His angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting [ to do to me ] .
44012012	When he , at a glance , became aware of this [ comprehending all the elements of the case ] , he went to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose surname was Mark , where a large number were assembled together and were praying .
44012013	And when he knocked at the gate of the porch , a maid named Rhoda came to answer .
44012014	And recognizing Peter’s voice , in her joy she failed to open the gate , but ran in and told the people that Peter was standing before the porch gate .
44012015	They said to her , You are crazy ! But she persistently and strongly and confidently affirmed that it was the truth . They said , It is his angel !
44012016	But meanwhile Peter continued knocking , and when they opened the gate and saw him , they were amazed .
44012017	But motioning to them with his hand to keep quiet and listen , he related to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison . And he said , Report all this to James [ the Less ] and to the brethren . Then he left and went to some other place .
44012018	Now as soon as it was day , there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter .
44012019	And when Herod had looked for him and could not find him , he placed the guards on trial and commanded that they should be led away [ to execution ] . Then [ Herod ] went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed on there .
44012020	Now [ Herod ] cherished bitter animosity and hostility for the people of Tyre and Sidon ; and [ their deputies ] came to him in a united body , and having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend , they asked for peace , because their country was nourished by and depended on the king’s [ country ] for food .
44012021	On an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in his royal robes , took his seat upon [ his ] throne , and addressed an oration to them .
44012022	And the assembled people shouted , It is the voice of a god , and not of a man !
44012023	And at once an angel of the Lord smote him and cut him down , because he did not give God the glory ( the preeminence and kingly majesty that belong to Him as the supreme Ruler ) ; and he was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	But the Word of the Lord [ concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] continued to grow and spread .
44012025	And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem when they had completed their mission , bringing with them John whose surname was Mark .
44013001	NOW IN the church ( assembly ) at Antioch there were prophets ( inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God ) and teachers : Barnabas , Symeon who was called Niger [ Black ] , Lucius of Cyrene , Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
44013002	While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting , the Holy Spirit said , Separate now for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them .
44013003	Then after fasting and praying , they put their hands on them and sent them away .
44013004	So then , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia , and from [ that port ] they sailed away to Cyprus .
44013005	When they arrived at Salamis , they preached the Word of God [ concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] in the synagogues of the Jews . And they had John [ Mark ] as an attendant to assist them .
44013006	When they had passed through the entire island of Cyprus as far as Paphos , they came upon a certain Jewish wizard or sorcerer , a false prophet named Bar-Jesus .
44013007	He was closely associated with the proconsul , Sergius Paulus , who was an intelligent and sensible man of sound understanding ; he summoned to him Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the Word of God [ concerning salvation in the kingdom of God attained through Christ ] .
44013008	But Elymas the wise man -- for that is the translation of his name [ which he had given himself ] -- opposed them , seeking to keep the proconsul from accepting the faith .
44013009	But Saul , who is also called Paul , filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit , looked steadily at [ Elymas ]
44013010	And said , You master in every form of deception and recklessness , unscrupulousness , and wickedness , you son of the devil , you enemy of everything that is upright and good , will you never stop perverting and making crooked the straight paths of the Lord and plotting against His saving purposes ?
44013011	And now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon you , and you will be blind , [ so blind that you will be ] unable to see the sun for a time . Instantly there fell upon him a mist and a darkness , and he groped about seeking persons who would lead him by the hand .
44013012	Then the proconsul believed ( became a Christian ) when he saw what had occurred , for he was astonished and deeply touched at the teaching concerning the Lord and from Him .
44013013	Now Paul and his companions sailed from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia . And John [ Mark ] separated himself from them and went back to Jerusalem ,
44013014	But they [ themselves ] came on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia . And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue there and sat down .
44013015	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets , the leaders [ of the worship ] of the synagogue sent to them saying , Brethren , if you have any word of exhortation or consolation or encouragement for the people , say it .
44013016	So Paul arose , and motioning with his hand said , Men of Israel and you who reverence and fear God , listen !
44013017	The God of this people Israel selected our forefathers and made this people great and important during their stay in the land of Egypt , and then with an uplifted arm He led them out from there .
44013018	And for about forty years like a fatherly nurse He cared for them in the wilderness and endured their behavior .
44013019	When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan , He gave them [ the Hebrews ] their land as an inheritance [ distributing it to them by lot ; all of which took ] about 450 years .
44013020	After that , He gave them judges until the prophet Samuel .
44013021	Then they asked for a king ; and God gave them Saul son of Kish , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , for forty years .
44013022	And when He had deposed him , He raised up David to be their king ; of him He bore witness and said , I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart , who will do all My will and carry out My program fully .
44013023	Of this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior [ in the person of Jesus ] , according to His promise .
44013024	Before His coming John had [ already ] preached baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
44013025	And as John was ending his course , he asked , What or who do you secretly think that I am ? I am not He [ the Christ . No ] , but note that after me One is coming , the sandals of Whose feet I am not worthy to untie !
44013026	Brethren , sons of the family of Abraham , and all those others among you who reverence and fear God , to us has been sent the message of this salvation [ the salvation obtained through Jesus Christ ] .
44013027	For those who dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers , because they did not know or recognize Him or understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath , have actually fulfilled these very predictions by condemning and sentencing [ Him ] .
44013028	And although they could find no cause deserving death with which to charge Him , yet they asked Pilate to have Him executed and put out of the way .
44013029	And when they had finished and fulfilled everything that was written about Him , they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb .
44013030	But God raised Him from the dead .
44013031	And for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem , and they are His witnesses to the people .
44013032	So now we are bringing you the good news ( Gospel ) that what God promised to our forefathers ,
44013033	This He has completely fulfilled for us , their children , by raising up Jesus , as it is written in the second psalm , You are My Son ; today I have begotten You [ caused You to arise , to be born ; formally shown You to be the Messiah by the resurrection ] .
44013034	And as to His having raised Him from among the dead , now no more to return to [ undergo ] putrefaction and dissolution [ of the grave ] , He spoke in this way , I will fulfill and give to you the holy and sure mercy and blessings [ that were promised and assured ] to David .
44013035	For this reason He says also in another psalm , You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption [ to undergo putrefaction and dissolution of the grave ] .
44013036	For David , after he had served God’s will and purpose and counsel in his own generation , fell asleep [ in death ] and was buried among his forefathers , and he did see corruption and undergo putrefaction and dissolution [ of the grave ] .
44013037	But He Whom God raised up [ to life ] saw no corruption [ did not experience putrefaction and dissolution of the grave ] .
44013038	So let it be clearly known and understood by you , brethren , that through this Man forgiveness and removal of sins is now proclaimed to you ;
44013039	And that through Him everyone who believes [ who acknowledges Jesus as his Savior and devotes himself to Him ] is absolved ( cleared and freed ) from every charge from which he could not be justified and freed by the Law of Moses and given right standing with God .
44013040	Take care , therefore , lest there come upon you what is spoken in the prophets :
44013041	Look , you scoffers and scorners , and marvel and perish and vanish away ; for I am doing a deed in your days , a deed which you will never have confidence in or believe , [ even ] if someone [ clearly describing it in detail ] declares it to you .
44013042	As they [ Paul and Barnabas ] went out [ of the synagogue ] , the people earnestly begged that these things might be told to them [ further ] the next Sabbath .
44013043	And when the congregation of the synagogue dispersed , many of the Jews and the devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas , who talked to them and urged them to continue [ to trust themselves to and to stand fast ] in the grace ( the unmerited favor and blessing ) of God .
44013044	The next Sabbath almost the entire city gathered together to hear the Word of God [ concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] .
44013045	But when the Jews saw the crowds , filled with envy and jealousy they contradicted what was said by Paul and talked abusively [ reviling and slandering him ] .
44013046	And Paul and Barnabas spoke out plainly and boldly , saying , It was necessary that God’s message [ concerning salvation through Christ ] should be spoken to you first . But since you thrust it from you , you pass this judgment on yourselves that you are unworthy of eternal life and out of your own mouth you will be judged . [ Now ] behold , we turn to the Gentiles ( the heathen ) .
44013047	For so the Lord has charged us , saying , I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles ( the heathen ) , that you may bring [ eternal ] salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth .
44013048	And when the Gentiles heard this , they rejoiced and glorified ( praised and gave thanks for ) the Word of God ; and as many as were destined ( appointed and ordained ) to eternal life believed ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Jesus as the Christ and their Savior ) .
44013049	And so the Word of the Lord [ concerning eternal salvation through Christ ] scattered and spread throughout the whole region .
44013050	But the Jews stirred up the devout women of high rank and the outstanding men of the town , and instigated persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their boundaries .
44013051	But [ the apostles ] shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium .
44013052	And the disciples were continually filled [ throughout their souls ] with joy and the Holy Spirit .
44014001	NOW AT Iconium [ also Paul and Barnabas ] went into the Jewish synagogue together and spoke with such power that a great number both of Jews and of Greeks believed ( became Christians ) ;
44014002	But the unbelieving Jews [ who rejected their message ] aroused the Gentiles and embittered their minds against the brethren .
44014003	So [ Paul and Barnabas ] stayed on there for a long time , speaking freely and fearlessly and boldly in the Lord , Who continued to bear testimony to the Word of His grace , granting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands .
44014004	But the residents of the town were divided , some siding with the Jews and some with the apostles .
44014005	When there was an attempt both on the part of the Gentiles and the Jews together with their rulers , to insult and abuse and molest [ Paul and Barnabas ] and to stone them ,
44014006	They , aware of the situation , made their escape to Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and the neighboring districts ;
44014007	And there they continued to preach the glad tidings ( Gospel ) .
44014008	Now at Lystra a man sat who found it impossible to use his feet , for he was a cripple from birth and had never walked .
44014009	He was listening to Paul as he talked , and [ Paul ] gazing intently at him and observing that he had faith to be healed ,
44014010	Shouted at him , saying , Stand erect on your feet ! And he leaped up and walked .
44014011	And the crowds , when they saw what Paul had done , lifted up their voices , shouting in the Lycaonian language , The gods have come down to us in human form !
44014012	They called Barnabas Zeus , and they called Paul , because he led in the discourse , Hermes [ god of speech ] .
44014013	And the priest of Zeus , whose [ temple ] was at the entrance of the town , brought bulls and garlands to the [ city’s ] gates and wanted to join the people in offering sacrifice .
44014014	But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it , they tore their clothing and dashed out among the crowd , shouting ,
44014015	Men , why are you doing this ? We also are [ only ] human beings , of nature like your own , and we bring you the good news ( Gospel ) that you should turn away from these foolish and vain things to the living God , Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that they contain .
44014016	In generations past He permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways ;
44014017	Yet He did not neglect to leave some witness of Himself , for He did you good and [ showed you ] kindness and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons , satisfying your hearts with nourishment and happiness .
44014018	Even in [ the light of ] these words they with difficulty prevented the people from offering sacrifice to them .
44014019	But some Jews arrived there from Antioch and Iconium ; and having persuaded the people and won them over , they stoned Paul and [ afterward ] dragged him out of the town , thinking that he was dead .
44014020	But the disciples formed a circle about him , and he got up and went back into the town ; and on the morrow he went on with Barnabas to Derbe .
44014021	When they had preached the good news ( Gospel ) to that town and made disciples of many of the people , they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch ,
44014022	Establishing and strengthening the souls and the hearts of the disciples , urging and warning and encouraging them to stand firm in the faith , and [ telling them ] that it is through many hardships and tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God .
44014023	And when they had appointed and ordained elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting , they committed them to the Lord in Whom they had come to believe [ being full of joyful trust that He is the Christ , the Messiah ] .
44014024	Then they went through Pisidia and arrived at Pamphylia .
44014025	And when they had spoken the Word in Perga [ the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] , they went down to Attalia ;
44014026	And from there they sailed back to Antioch , where they had [ first ] been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had [ now ] completed .
44014027	Arriving there , they gathered the church together and declared all that God had accomplished with them and how He had opened to the Gentiles a door of faith [ in Jesus as the Messiah , through Whom we obtain salvation in the kingdom of God ] .
44014028	And there they stayed no little time with the disciples .
44015001	BUT SOME men came down from Judea and were instructing the brethren , Unless you are circumcised in accordance with the Mosaic custom , you cannot be saved .
44015002	And when Paul and Barnabas had no small disagreement and discussion with them , it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the others of their number should go up to Jerusalem [ and confer ] with the apostles ( special messengers ) and the elders about this matter .
44015003	So , being fitted out and sent on their way by the church , they went through both Phoenicia and Samaria telling of the conversion of the Gentiles ( the heathen ) , and they caused great rejoicing among all the brethren .
44015004	When they arrived in Jerusalem , they were heartily welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders , and they told them all that God had accomplished through them .
44015005	But some who believed [ who acknowledged Jesus as their Savior and devoted themselves to Him ] belonged to the sect of the Pharisees , and they rose up and said , It is necessary to circumcise [ the Gentile converts ] and to charge them to obey the Law of Moses .
44015006	The apostles and the elders were assembled together to look into and consider this matter .
44015007	And after there had been a long debate , Peter got up and said to them , Brethren , you know that quite a while ago God made a choice or selection from among you , that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of the Gospel [ concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] and believe ( credit and place their confidence in it ) .
44015008	And God , Who is acquainted with and understands the heart , bore witness to them , giving them the Holy Spirit as He also did to us ;
44015009	And He made no difference between us and them , but cleansed their hearts by faith ( by a strong and welcome conviction that Jesus is the Messiah , through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ) .
44015010	Now then , why do you try to test God by putting a yoke on the necks of the disciples , such as neither our forefathers nor we [ ourselves ] were able to endure ?
44015011	But we believe that we are saved through the grace ( the undeserved favor and mercy ) of the Lord Jesus , just as they [ are ] .
44015012	Then the whole assembly remained silent , and they listened [ attentively ] as Barnabas and Paul rehearsed what signs and wonders God had performed through them among the Gentiles .
44015013	When they had finished talking , James replied , Brethren , listen to me .
44015014	Simeon [ Peter ] has rehearsed how God first visited the Gentiles , to take out of them a people [ to bear and honor ] His name .
44015015	And with this the predictions of the prophets agree , as it is written ,
44015016	After this I will come back , and will rebuild the house of David , which has fallen ; I will rebuild its [ very ] ruins , and I will set it up again ,
44015017	So that the rest of men may seek the Lord , and all the Gentiles upon whom My name has been invoked ,
44015018	Says the Lord , Who has been making these things known from the beginning of the world .
44015019	Therefore it is my opinion that we should not put obstacles in the way of and annoy and disturb those of the Gentiles who turn to God ,
44015020	But we should send word to them in writing to abstain from and avoid anything that has been polluted by being offered to idols , and all sexual impurity , and [ eating meat of animals ] that have been strangled , and [ tasting of ] blood .
44015021	For from ancient generations Moses has had his preachers in every town , for he is read [ aloud ] every Sabbath in the synagogues .
44015022	Then the apostles and the elders , together with the whole church , resolved to select men from among their number and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas . They chose Judas called Barsabbas , and Silas , [ both ] leading men among the brethren , and sent them .
44015023	With [ them they sent ] the following letter : The brethren , both the apostles and the elders , to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia , greetings :
44015024	As we have heard that some persons from our number have disturbed you with their teaching , unsettling your minds and throwing you into confusion , although we gave them no express orders or instructions [ on the points in question ] ,
44015025	It has been resolved by us in assembly to select men and send them [ as messengers ] to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
44015026	Men who have hazarded their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	So we have sent Judas and Silas , who themselves will bring you the same message by word of mouth .
44015028	For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to lay upon you any greater burden than these indispensable requirements :
44015029	That you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from [ tasting ] blood and from [ eating the meat of animals ] that have been strangled and from sexual impurity . If you keep yourselves from these things , you will do well . Farewell [ be strong ] !
44015030	So when [ the messengers ] were sent off , they went down to Antioch ; and having assembled the congregation , they delivered the letter .
44015031	And when they read it , the people rejoiced at the consolation and encouragement [ it brought them ] .
44015032	And Judas and Silas , who were themselves prophets ( inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God ) , urged and warned and consoled and encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them .
44015033	And after spending some time there , they were sent back by the brethren with [ the greeting ] peace to those who had sent them .
44015034	However , Silas decided to stay on there .
44015035	But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch and with many others also continued teaching and proclaiming the good news , the Word of the Lord [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in God’s kingdom ] .
44015036	And after some time Paul said to Barnabas , Come , let us go back and again visit and help and minister to the brethren in every town where we made known the message of the Lord , and see how they are getting along .
44015037	Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark [ his near relative ] .
44015038	But Paul did not think it best to have along with them the one who had quit and deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work .
44015039	And there followed a sharp disagreement between them , so that they separated from each other , and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus .
44015040	But Paul selected Silas and set out , being commended by the brethren to the grace ( the favor and mercy ) of the Lord .
44015041	And he passed through Syria and Cilicia , establishing and strengthening the churches .
44016001	AND [ Paul ] went down to Derbe and also to Lystra . A disciple named Timothy was there , the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer [ she had become convinced that Jesus is the Messiah and the Author of eternal salvation , and yielded obedience to Him ] ; but [ Timothy’s ] father was a Greek .
44016002	He [ Timothy ] had a good reputation among the brethren at Lystra and Iconium .
44016003	Paul desired Timothy to go with him [ as a missionary ] ; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places , all of whom knew that his father was a Greek .
44016004	As they went on their way from town to town , they delivered over [ to the assemblies ] for their observance the regulations decided upon by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem .
44016005	So the churches were strengthened and made firm in the faith , and they increased in number day after day .
44016006	And Paul and Silas passed through the territory of Phrygia and Galatia , having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Word in [ the province of ] Asia .
44016007	And when they had come opposite Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them .
44016008	So passing by Mysia , they went down to Troas .
44016009	[ There ] a vision appeared to Paul in the night : a man from Macedonia stood pleading with him and saying , Come over to Macedonia and help us !
44016010	And when he had seen the vision , we [ including Luke ] at once endeavored to go on into Macedonia , confidently inferring that God had called us to proclaim the glad tidings ( Gospel ) to them .
44016011	Therefore , setting sail from Troas , we came in a direct course to Samothrace , and the next day went on to Neapolis .
44016012	And from there [ we came ] to Philippi , which is the chief city of the district of Macedonia and a [ Roman ] colony . We stayed on in this place some days ;
44016013	And on the Sabbath day we went outside the [ city’s ] gate to the bank of the river where we supposed there was an [ accustomed ] place of prayer , and we sat down and addressed the women who had assembled there .
44016014	One of those who listened to us was a woman named Lydia , from the city of Thyatira , a dealer in fabrics dyed in purple . She was [ already ] a worshiper of God , and the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul .
44016015	And when she was baptized along with her household , she earnestly entreated us , saying , If in your opinion I am one really convinced [ that Jesus is the Messiah and the Author of salvation ] and that I will be faithful to the Lord , come to my house and stay . And she induced us [ to do it ] .
44016016	As we were on our way to the place of prayer , we were met by a slave girl who was possessed by a spirit of divination [ claiming to foretell future events and to discover hidden knowledge ] , and she brought her owners much gain by her fortunetelling .
44016017	She kept following Paul and [ the rest of ] us , shouting loudly , These men are the servants of the Most High God ! They announce to you the way of salvation !
44016018	And she did this for many days . Then Paul , being sorely annoyed and worn out , turned and said to the spirit within her , I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! And it came out that very moment .
44016019	But when her owners discovered that their hope of profit was gone , they caught hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the forum ( marketplace ) , [ where trials are held ] .
44016020	And when they had brought them before the magistrates , they declared , These fellows are Jews and they are throwing our city into great confusion .
44016021	They encourage the practice of customs which it is unlawful for us Romans to accept or observe !
44016022	The crowd [ also ] joined in the attack upon them , and the rulers tore the clothes off of them and commanded that they be beaten with rods .
44016023	And when they had struck them with many blows , they threw them into prison , charging the jailer to keep them safely .
44016024	He , having received [ so strict a ] charge , put them into the inner prison ( the dungeon ) and fastened their feet in the stocks .
44016025	But about midnight , as Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God , and the [ other ] prisoners were listening to them ,
44016026	Suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the very foundations of the prison were shaken ; and at once all the doors were opened and everyone’s shackles were unfastened .
44016027	When the jailer , startled out of his sleep , saw that the prison doors were open , he drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself , because he supposed that the prisoners had escaped .
44016028	But Paul shouted , Do not harm yourself , for we are all here !
44016029	Then [ the jailer ] called for lights and rushed in , and trembling and terrified he fell down before Paul and Silas .
44016030	And he brought them out [ of the dungeon ] and said , Men , what is it necessary for me to do that I may be saved ?
44016031	And they answered , Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ [ give yourself up to Him , take yourself out of your own keeping and entrust yourself into His keeping ] and you will be saved , [ and this applies both to ] you and your household as well .
44016032	And they declared the Word of the Lord [ the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ] to him and to all who were in his house .
44016033	And he took them the same hour of the night and bathed [ them because of their bloody ] wounds , and he was baptized immediately and all [ the members of ] his [ household ] .
44016034	Then he took them up into his house and set food before them ; and he leaped much for joy and exulted with all his family that he believed in God [ accepting and joyously welcoming what He had made known through Christ ] .
44016035	But when it was day , the magistrates sent policemen , saying , Release those fellows and let them go .
44016036	And the jailer repeated the words to Paul , saying , The magistrates have sent to release you and let you go ; now therefore come out and go in peace .
44016037	But Paul answered them , They have beaten us openly and publicly , without a trial and uncondemned , men who are Roman citizens , and have thrown us into prison ; and do they now thrust us out secretly ? No , indeed ! Let them come here themselves and conduct us out !
44016038	The police reported this message to the magistrates , and they were frightened when they heard that the prisoners were Roman citizens ;
44016039	So they came themselves and [ striving to appease them by entreaty ] apologized to them . And they brought them out and asked them to leave the city .
44016040	So [ Paul and Silas ] left the prison and went to Lydia’s house ; and when they had seen the brethren , they warned and urged and consoled and encouraged them and departed .
44017001	NOW AFTER [ Paul and Silas ] had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where there was a synagogue of the Jews .
44017002	And Paul entered , as he usually did , and for three Sabbaths he reasoned and argued with them from the Scriptures ,
44017003	Explaining [ them ] and [ quoting passages ] setting forth and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead , and saying , This Jesus , Whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ ( the Messiah ) .
44017004	And some of them [ accordingly ] were induced to believe and associated themselves with Paul and Silas , as did a great number of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women .
44017005	But the unbelieving Jews were aroused to jealousy , and , getting hold of some wicked men ( ruffians and rascals ) and loungers in the marketplace , they gathered together a mob , set the town in an uproar , and attacked the house of Jason , seeking to bring [ Paul and Silas ] out to the people .
44017006	But when they failed to find them , they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities , crying , These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also ,
44017007	And Jason has received them to his house and privately protected them ! And they are all ignoring and acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar , [ actually ] asserting that there is another king , one Jesus !
44017008	And both the crowd and the city authorities , on hearing this , were irritated ( stirred up and troubled ) .
44017009	And when they had taken security [ bail ] from Jason and the others , they let them go .
44017010	Now the brethren at once sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea ; and when they arrived , they entered the synagogue of the Jews .
44017011	Now these [ Jews ] were better disposed and more noble than those in Thessalonica , for they were entirely ready and accepted and welcomed the message [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ] with inclination of mind and eagerness , searching and examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so .
44017012	Many of them therefore became believers , together with not a few prominent Greeks , women as well as men .
44017013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the Word of God [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ] was also preached by Paul at Beroea , they came there too , disturbing and inciting the masses .
44017014	At once the brethren sent Paul off on his way to the sea , but Silas and Timothy remained behind .
44017015	Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens ; and receiving instructions for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible , they departed .
44017016	Now while Paul was awaiting them at Athens , his spirit was grieved and roused to anger as he saw that the city was full of idols .
44017017	So he reasoned and argued in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshiped there , and in the marketplace [ where assemblies are held ] day after day with any who chanced to be there .
44017018	And some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him and began to engage in discussion . And some said , What is this babbler with his scrap-heap learning trying to say ? Others said , He seems to be an announcer of foreign deities -- because he preached Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus [ Mars Hill meeting place ] , saying , May we know what this novel ( unheard of and unprecedented ) teaching is which you are openly declaring ?
44017020	For you set forth some startling things , foreign and strange to our ears ; we wish to know therefore just what these things mean --
44017021	For the Athenians , all of them , and the foreign residents and visitors among them spent all their leisure time in nothing except telling or hearing something newer than the last --
44017022	So Paul , standing in the center of the Areopagus [ Mars Hill meeting place ] , said : Men of Athens , I perceive in every way [ on every hand and with every turn I make ] that you are most religious or very reverent to demons .
44017023	For as I passed along and carefully observed your objects of worship , I came also upon an altar with this inscription , To the unknown god . Now what you are already worshiping as unknown , this I set forth to you .
44017024	The God Who produced and formed the world and all things in it , being Lord of heaven and earth , does not dwell in handmade shrines .
44017025	Neither is He served by human hands , as though He lacked anything , for it is He Himself Who gives life and breath and all things to all [ people ] .
44017026	And He made from one [ common origin , one source , one blood ] all nations of men to settle on the face of the earth , having definitely determined [ their ] allotted periods of time and the fixed boundaries of their habitation ( their settlements , lands , and abodes ) ,
44017027	So that they should seek God , in the hope that they might feel after Him and find Him , although He is not far from each one of us .
44017028	For in Him we live and move and have our being ; as even some of your [ own ] poets have said , For we are also His offspring .
44017029	Since then we are God’s offspring , we ought not to suppose that Deity ( the Godhead ) is like gold or silver or stone , [ of the nature of ] a representation by human art and imagination , or anything constructed or invented .
44017030	Such [ former ] ages of ignorance God , it is true , ignored and allowed to pass unnoticed ; but now He charges all people everywhere to repent ( to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways , with abhorrence of their past sins ) ,
44017031	Because He has fixed a day when He will judge the world righteously ( justly ) by a Man Whom He has destined and appointed for that task , and He has made this credible and given conviction and assurance and evidence to everyone by raising Him from the dead .
44017032	Now when they had heard [ that there had been ] a resurrection from the dead , some scoffed ; but others said , We will hear you again about this matter .
44017033	So Paul went out from among them .
44017034	But some men were on his side and joined him and believed ( became Christians ) ; among them were Dionysius , a judge of the Areopagus , and a woman named Damaris , and some others with them .
44018001	AFTER THIS [ Paul ] departed from Athens and went to Corinth .
44018002	There he met a Jew named Aquila , a native of Pontus , recently arrived from Italy with Priscilla his wife , due to the fact that Claudius had issued an edict that all the Jews were to leave Rome . And [ Paul ] went to see them ,
44018003	And because he was of the same occupation , he stayed with them ; and they worked [ together ] , for they were tentmakers by trade .
44018004	But he discoursed and argued in the synagogue every Sabbath and won over [ both ] Jews and Greeks .
44018005	By the time Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia , Paul was completely engrossed with preaching , earnestly arguing and testifying to the Jews that Jesus [ is ] the Christ .
44018006	But since they kept opposing and abusing and reviling him , he shook out his clothing [ against them ] and said to them , Your blood be upon your [ own ] heads ! I am innocent [ of it ] . From now on I will go to the Gentiles ( the heathen ) .
44018007	He then left there and went to the house of a man named Titus Justus , who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue .
44018008	But Crispus , the leader of the synagogue , believed [ that Jesus is the Messiah and acknowledged Him with joyful trust as Savior and Lord ] , together with his entire household ; and many of the Corinthians who listened [ to Paul also ] believed and were baptized .
44018009	And one night the Lord said to Paul in a vision , Have no fear , but speak and do not keep silent ;
44018010	For I am with you , and no man shall assault you to harm you , for I have many people in this city .
44018011	So he settled down among them for a year and six months , teaching the Word of God [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ] .
44018012	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia ( most of Greece ) , the Jews unitedly made an attack upon Paul and brought him before the judge’s seat ,
44018013	Declaring , This fellow is advising and inducing and inciting people to worship God in violation of the Law [ of Rome and of Moses ] .
44018014	But when Paul was about to open his mouth to reply , Gallio said to the Jews , If it were a matter of some misdemeanor or villainy , O Jews , I should have cause to bear with you and listen ;
44018015	But since it is merely a question [ of doctrine ] about words and names and your own law , see to it yourselves ; I decline to be a judge of such matters and I have no intention of trying such cases .
44018016	And he drove them away from the judgment seat .
44018017	Then they [ the Greeks ] all seized Sosthenes , the leader of the synagogue , and beat him right in front of the judgment seat . But Gallio paid no attention to any of this .
44018018	Afterward Paul remained many days longer , and then told the brethren farewell and sailed for Syria ; and he was accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila . At Cenchreae he [ Paul ] cut his hair , for he had made a vow .
44018019	Then they arrived in Ephesus , and [ Paul ] left the others there ; but he himself entered the synagogue and discoursed and argued with the Jews .
44018020	When they asked him to remain for a longer time , he would not consent ;
44018021	But when he was leaving them he said , I will return to you if God is willing , and he set sail from Ephesus .
44018022	When he landed at Caesarea , he went up and saluted the church [ at Jerusalem ] , and then went down to Antioch .
44018023	After staying there some time , he left and went from place to place in an orderly journey through the territory of Galatia and Phrygia , establishing the disciples and imparting new strength to them .
44018024	Meanwhile , there was a Jew named Apollos , a native of Alexandria , who came to Ephesus . He was a cultured and eloquent man , well versed and mighty in the Scriptures .
44018025	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord , and burning with spiritual zeal , he spoke and taught diligently and accurately the things concerning Jesus , though he was acquainted only with the baptism of John .
44018026	He began to speak freely ( fearlessly and boldly ) in the synagogue ; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him with them and expounded to him the way of God more definitely and accurately .
44018027	And when [ Apollos ] wished to cross to Achaia ( most of Greece ) , the brethren wrote to the disciples there , urging and encouraging them to accept and welcome him heartily . When he arrived , he proved a great help to those who through grace ( God’s unmerited favor and mercy ) had believed ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Christ as Lord and Savior ) .
44018028	For with great power he refuted the Jews in public [ discussions ] , showing and proving by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ ( the Messiah ) .
44019001	WHILE APOLLOS was in Corinth , Paul went through the upper inland districts and came down to Ephesus . There he found some disciples .
44019002	And he asked them , Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed [ on Jesus as the Christ ] ? And they said , No , we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit .
44019003	And he asked , Into what [ baptism ] then were you baptized ? They said , Into John’s baptism .
44019004	And Paul said , John baptized with the baptism of repentance , continually telling the people that they should believe in the One Who was to come after him , that is , in Jesus [ having a conviction full of joyful trust that He is Christ , the Messiah , and being obedient to Him ] .
44019005	On hearing this they were baptized [ again , this time ] in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	And as Paul laid his hands upon them , the Holy Spirit came on them ; and they spoke in [ foreign , unknown ] tongues ( languages ) and prophesied .
44019007	There were about twelve of them in all .
44019008	And he went into the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly , persuading and arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But when some became more and more stubborn ( hardened and unbelieving ) , discrediting and reviling and speaking evil of the Way [ of the Lord ] before the congregation , he separated himself from them , taking the disciples with him , and went on holding daily discussions in the lecture room of Tyrannus from about ten o’clock till three .
44019010	This continued for two years , so that all the inhabitants of [ the province of ] Asia , Jews as well as Greeks , heard the Word of the Lord [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ] .
44019011	And God did unusual and extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul ,
44019012	So that handkerchiefs or towels or aprons which had touched his skin were carried away and put upon the sick , and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them .
44019013	Then some of the traveling Jewish exorcists ( men who adjure evil spirits ) also undertook to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits , saying , I solemnly implore and charge you by the Jesus Whom Paul preaches !
44019014	Seven sons of a certain Jewish chief priest named Sceva were doing this .
44019015	But [ one ] evil spirit retorted , Jesus I know , and Paul I know about , but who are you ?
44019016	Then the man in whom the evil spirit dwelt leaped upon them , mastering two of them , and was so violent against them that they dashed out of that house [ in fear ] , stripped naked and wounded .
44019017	This became known to all who lived in Ephesus , both Jews and Greeks , and alarm and terror fell upon them all ; and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled and magnified .
44019018	Many also of those who were now believers came making full confession and thoroughly exposing their [ former deceptive and evil ] practices .
44019019	And many of those who had practiced curious , magical arts collected their books and [ throwing them , book after book , on the pile ] burned them in the sight of everybody . When they counted the value of them , they found it amounted to 50,000 pieces of silver ( about $ 9,300 ) .
44019020	Thus the Word of the Lord [ concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ] grew and spread and intensified , prevailing mightily .
44019021	Now after these events Paul determined in the [ Holy ] Spirit that he would travel through Macedonia and Achaia ( most of Greece ) and go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must visit Rome also .
44019022	And having sent two of his assistants , Timothy and Erastus , into Macedonia , he himself stayed on in [ the province of ] Asia for a while .
44019023	But as time went on , there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way [ of the Lord ] .
44019024	For a man named Demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of [ the goddess ] Artemis [ Diana ] , brought no small income to his craftsmen .
44019025	These he called together , along with the workmen of similar trades , and said , Men , you are acquainted with the facts and understand that from this business we derive our wealth and livelihood .
44019026	Now you notice and hear that not only at Ephesus but almost all over [ the province of ] Asia this Paul has persuaded and induced people to believe his teaching and has alienated a considerable company of them , saying that gods that are made with human hands are not really gods at all .
44019027	Now there is danger not merely that this trade of ours may be discredited , but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may come into disrepute and count for nothing , and that her glorious magnificence may be degraded and fall into contempt -- she whom all [ the province of ] Asia and the wide world worship .
44019028	As they listened to this , they were filled with rage and they continued to shout , Great is Artemis of the Ephesians !
44019029	Then the city was filled with confusion ; and they rushed together into the amphitheater , dragging along with them Gaius and Aristarchus , Macedonians who were fellow travelers with Paul .
44019030	Paul wished to go in among the crowd , but the disciples would not permit him to do it .
44019031	Even some of the Asiarchs ( political or religious officials in Asia ) who were his friends also sent to him and warned him not to risk venturing into the theater .
44019032	Now some shouted one thing and some another , for the gathering was in a tumult and most of them did not know why they had come together .
44019033	Some of the crowd called upon Alexander [ to speak ] , since the Jews had pushed and urged him forward . And Alexander motioned with his hand , wishing to make a defense and [ planning ] to apologize to the people .
44019034	But as soon as they saw him and recognized that he was a Jew , a shout went up from them as the voice of one man , as for about two hours they cried , Great is Artemis of the Ephesians !
44019035	And when the town clerk had calmed the crowd down , he said , Men of Ephesus , what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the sacred stone [ image of her ] that fell from the sky ?
44019036	Seeing then that these things cannot be denied , you ought to be quiet ( keep yourselves in check ) and do nothing rashly .
44019037	For you have brought these men here , who are [ guilty of ] neither temple robberies nor blasphemous speech about our goddess .
44019038	Now then , if Demetrius and his fellow tradesmen who are with him have a grievance against anyone , the courts are open and proconsuls are [ available ] ; let them bring charges against one another [ legally ] .
44019039	But if you require anything further about this or about other matters , it must be decided and cleared up in the regular assembly .
44019040	For we are in danger of being called to render an account and of being accused of rioting because of [ this commotion ] today , there being no reason that we can offer to justify this disorder .
44019041	And when he had said these things , he dismissed the assembly .
44020001	AFTER THE uproar had ceased , Paul sent for the disciples and warned and consoled and urged and encouraged them ; then he embraced them and told them farewell and set forth on his journey to Macedonia .
44020002	Then after he had gone through those districts and had warned and consoled and urged and encouraged the brethren with much discourse , he came to Greece .
44020003	Having spent three months there , when a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria , he resolved to go back through Macedonia .
44020004	He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea , and by the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus , and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy , and the Asians Tychicus and Trophimus .
44020005	These went on ahead and were waiting for us [ including Luke ] at Troas ,
44020006	But we [ ourselves ] sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread [ the Passover week ] , and in five days we joined them at Troas , where we remained for seven days .
44020007	And on the first day of the week , when we were assembled together to break bread [ the Lord’s Supper ] , Paul discoursed with them , intending to leave the next morning ; and he kept on with his message until midnight .
44020008	Now there were numerous lights in the upper room where we were assembled ,
44020009	And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window . He was borne down with deep sleep as Paul kept on talking still longer , and [ finally ] completely overcome by sleep , he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead .
44020010	But Paul went down and bent over him and embraced him , saying , Make no ado ; his life is within him .
44020011	When Paul had gone back upstairs and had broken bread and eaten [ with them ] , and after he had talked confidentially and communed with them for a considerable time -- until daybreak [ in fact ] -- he departed .
44020012	They took the youth home alive , and were not a little comforted and cheered and refreshed and encouraged .
44020013	But going on ahead to the ship , the rest of us set sail for Assos , intending to take Paul aboard there , for that was what he had directed , intending himself to go by land [ on foot ] .
44020014	So when he met us at Assos , we took him aboard and sailed on to Mitylene .
44020015	And sailing from there , we arrived the day after at a point opposite Chios ; the following day we struck across to Samos , and the next day we arrived at Miletus .
44020016	For Paul had determined to sail on past Ephesus , lest he might have to spend time [ unnecessarily ] in [ the province of ] Asia ; for he was hastening on so that he might reach Jerusalem , if at all possible , by the day of Pentecost .
44020017	However , from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church [ to come to him there ] .
44020018	And when they arrived he said to them : You yourselves are well acquainted with my manner of living among you from the first day that I set foot in [ the province of ] Asia , and how I continued afterward ,
44020019	Serving the Lord with all humility in tears and in the midst of adversity ( affliction and trials ) which befell me , due to the plots of the Jews [ against me ] ;
44020020	How I did not shrink from telling you anything that was for your benefit and teaching you in public meetings and from house to house ,
44020021	But constantly and earnestly I bore testimony both to Jews and Greeks , urging them to turn in repentance [ that is due ] to God and to have faith in our Lord Jesus Christ [ that is due Him ] .
44020022	And now , you see , I am going to Jerusalem , bound by the [ Holy ] Spirit and obligated and compelled by the [ convictions of my own ] spirit , not knowing what will befall me there --
44020023	Except that the Holy Spirit clearly and emphatically affirms to me in city after city that imprisonment and suffering await me .
44020024	But none of these things move me ; neither do I esteem my life dear to myself , if only I may finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have obtained from [ which was entrusted to me by ] the Lord Jesus , faithfully to attest to the good news ( Gospel ) of God’s grace ( His unmerited favor , spiritual blessing , and mercy ) .
44020025	And now , observe , I perceive that all of you , among whom I have gone in and out proclaiming the kingdom , will see my face no more .
44020026	Therefore I testify and protest to you on this [ our parting ] day that I am clean and innocent and not responsible for the blood of any of you .
44020027	For I never shrank or kept back or fell short from declaring to you the whole purpose and plan and counsel of God .
44020028	Take care and be on guard for yourselves and the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has appointed you bishops and guardians , to shepherd ( tend and feed and guide ) the church of the Lord or of God which He obtained for Himself [ buying it and saving it for Himself ] with His own blood .
44020029	I know that after I am gone , ferocious wolves will get in among you , not sparing the flock ;
44020030	Even from among your own selves men will come to the front who , by saying perverse ( distorted and corrupt ) things , will endeavor to draw away the disciples after them [ to their own party ] .
44020031	Therefore be always alert and on your guard , being mindful that for three years I never stopped night or day seriously to admonish and advise and exhort you one by one with tears .
44020032	And now [ brethren ] , I commit you to God [ I deposit you in His charge , entrusting you to His protection and care ] . And I commend you to the Word of His grace [ to the commands and counsels and promises of His unmerited favor ] . It is able to build you up and to give you [ your rightful ] inheritance among all God’s set-apart ones ( those consecrated , purified , and transformed of soul ) .
44020033	I coveted no man’s silver or gold or [ costly ] garments .
44020034	You yourselves know personally that these hands ministered to my own needs and those [ of the persons ] who were with me .
44020035	In everything I have pointed out to you [ by example ] that , by working diligently in this manner , we ought to assist the weak , being mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus , how He Himself said , It is more blessed ( makes one happier and more to be envied ) to give than to receive .
44020036	Having spoken thus , he knelt down with them all and prayed .
44020037	And they all wept freely and threw their arms around Paul’s neck and kissed him fervently and repeatedly ,
44020038	Being especially distressed and sorrowful because he had stated that they were about to see his face no more . And they accompanied him to the ship .
44021001	AND WHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and withdrawn , we set sail and made a straight run to Cos , and on the following [ day came ] to Rhodes and from there to Patara .
44021002	There we found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia ; so we went aboard and sailed away .
44021003	After we had sighted Cyprus , leaving it on our left we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre , for there the ship was to unload her cargo .
44021004	And having looked up the disciples there , we remained with them for seven days . Prompted by the [ Holy ] Spirit , they kept telling Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem .
44021005	But when our time there was ended , we left and proceeded on our journey ; and all of them with their wives and children accompanied us on our way till we were outside the city . There we knelt down on the beach and prayed .
44021006	Then when we had told one another farewell , we went on board the ship , and they returned to their own homes .
44021007	When we had completed the voyage from Tyre , we landed at Ptolemais , where we paid our respects to the brethren and remained with them for one day .
44021008	On the morrow we left there and came to Caesarea ; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist , who was one of the Seven [ first deacons ] , and stayed with him .
44021009	And he had four maiden daughters who had the gift of prophecy .
44021010	While we were remaining there for some time , a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea .
44021011	And coming to [ see ] us , he took Paul’s belt and with it bound his own feet and hands and said , Thus says the Holy Spirit : The Jews at Jerusalem shall bind like this the man who owns this belt , and they shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles ( heathen ) .
44021012	When we heard this , both we and the residents of that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul replied , What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart like this ? For I hold myself in readiness not only to be arrested and bound and imprisoned at Jerusalem , but also [ even ] to die for the name of the Lord Jesus .
44021014	And when he would not yield to [ our ] persuading , we stopped [ urging and imploring him ] , saying , The Lord’s will be done !
44021015	After these days we packed our baggage and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	And some of the disciples from Caesarea came with us , conducting us to the house of Mnason , a man from Cyprus , one of the disciples of long standing , with whom we were to lodge .
44021017	When we arrived in Jerusalem , the brethren received and welcomed us gladly .
44021018	On the next day Paul went in with us to [ see ] James , and all the elders of the church were present [ also ] .
44021019	After saluting them , Paul gave a detailed account of the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry .
44021020	And upon hearing it , they adored and exalted and praised and thanked God . And they said to [ Paul ] , You see , brother , how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews , and all of them are enthusiastic upholders of the [ Mosaic ] Law .
44021021	Now they have been informed about you that you continually teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn back from and forsake Moses , advising them not to circumcise their children or pay any attention to the observance of the [ Mosaic ] customs .
44021022	What then [ is best that ] should be done ? A multitude will come together , for they will surely hear that you have arrived .
44021023	Therefore do just what we tell you . With us are four men who have taken a vow upon themselves .
44021024	Take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses [ for the temple offering ] , so that they may have their heads shaved . Thus everybody will know that there is no truth in what they have been told about you , but that you yourself walk in observance of the Law .
44021025	But with regard to the Gentiles who have believed ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Christ ) , we have sent them a letter with our decision that they should keep themselves free from anything that has been sacrificed to idols and from [ tasting ] blood and [ eating the meat of animals ] which have been strangled and from all impurity and sexual immorality .
44021026	Then Paul took the [ four ] men with him and the following day [ he went through the rites of ] purifying himself along with them . And they entered the temple to give notice when the days of purification ( the ending of each vow ) would be fulfilled and the usual offering could be presented on behalf of each of them .
44021027	When the seven days were drawing to a close , some of the Jews from [ the province of ] Asia , who had caught sight of Paul in the temple , incited all the rabble and laid hands on him ,
44021028	Shouting , Men of Israel , help ! [ Help ! ] This is the man who is teaching everybody everywhere against the people and the Law and this place ! Moreover , he has also [ actually ] brought Greeks into the temple ; he has desecrated and polluted this holy place !
44021029	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and they supposed that he had brought the man into the temple [ into the inner court forbidden to Gentiles ] .
44021030	Then the whole city was aroused and thrown into confusion , and the people rushed together ; they laid hands on Paul and dragged him outside the temple , and immediately the gates were closed .
44021031	Now while they were trying to kill him , word came to the commandant of the regular Roman garrison that the whole of Jerusalem was in a state of ferment .
44021032	So immediately he took soldiers and centurions and hurried down among them ; and when the people saw the commandant and the troops , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	Then the commandant approached and arrested Paul and ordered that he be secured with two chains . He then inquired who he was and what he had done .
44021034	Some in the crowd kept shouting back one thing and others something else , and since he could not ascertain the facts because of the furor , he ordered that Paul be removed to the barracks .
44021035	And when [ Paul ] came to mount the steps , he was actually being carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob ;
44021036	For the mass of the people kept following them , shouting , Away with him ! [ Kill him ! ]
44021037	Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks , he asked the commandant , May I say something to you ? And the man replied , Can you speak Greek ?
44021038	Are you not then [ as I supposed ] the Egyptian who not long ago stirred up a rebellion and led those 4,000 men who were cutthroats out into the wilderness ( desert ) ?
44021039	Paul answered , I am a Jew , from Tarsus in Cilicia , a citizen of no insignificant or undistinguished city . I beg you , allow me to address the people .
44021040	And when the man had granted him permission , Paul , standing on the steps , gestured with his hand to the people ; and there was a great hush . Then he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect , saying :
44022001	BRETHREN AND fathers , listen to the defense which I now make in your presence .
44022002	And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue , they were all the more quiet . And he continued ,
44022003	I am a Jew , born in Tarsus of Cilicia but reared in this city . At the feet of Gamaliel I was educated according to the strictest care in the Law of our fathers , being ardent [ even a zealot ] for God , as all of you are today .
44022004	[ Yes ] I harassed ( troubled , molested , and persecuted ) this Way [ of the Lord ] to the death , putting in chains and committing to prison both men and women ,
44022005	As the high priest and whole council of elders ( Sanhedrin ) can testify ; for from them indeed I received letters with which I was on my way to the brethren in Damascus in order to take also those [ believers ] who were there , and bring them in chains to Jerusalem that they might be punished .
44022006	But as I was on my journey and approached Damascus , about noon a great blaze of light flashed suddenly from heaven and shone about me .
44022007	And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , Saul , Saul , why do you persecute Me [ harass and trouble and molest Me ] ?
44022008	And I replied , Who are You , Lord ? And He said to me , I am Jesus the Nazarene , Whom you are persecuting .
44022009	Now the men who were with me saw the light , but they did not hear [ the sound of the uttered words of ] the voice of the One Who was speaking to me [ so that they could understand it ] .
44022010	And I asked , What shall I do , Lord ? And the Lord answered me , Get up and go into Damascus , and there it will be told you all that it is destined and appointed for you to do .
44022011	And since I could not see because [ of the dazzlingly glorious intensity ] of the brightness of that light , I was led by the hand by those who were with me , and [ thus ] I arrived in Damascus .
44022012	And one Ananias , a devout man according to the Law , well spoken of by all the Jews who resided there ,
44022013	Came to see me , and standing by my side said to me , Brother Saul , look up and receive back your sight . And in that very instant I [ recovered my sight and ] looking up saw him .
44022014	And he said , The God of our forefathers has destined and appointed you to come progressively to know His will [ to perceive , to recognize more strongly and clearly , and to become better and more intimately acquainted with His will ] , and to see the Righteous One ( Jesus Christ , the Messiah ) , and to hear a voice from His [ own ] mouth and a message from His [ own ] lips ;
44022015	For you will be His witness unto all men of everything that you have seen and heard .
44022016	And now , why do you delay ? Rise and be baptized , and by calling upon His name , wash away your sins .
44022017	Then when I had come back to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple [ enclosure ] , I fell into a trance ( an ecstasy ) ;
44022018	And I saw Him as He said to me , Hurry , get quickly out of Jerusalem , because they will not receive your testimony about Me .
44022019	And I said , Lord , they themselves well know that throughout all the synagogues I cast into prison and flogged those who believed on ( adhered to and trusted in and relied on ) You .
44022020	And when the blood of Your witness ( martyr ) Stephen was shed , I also was personally standing by and consenting and approving and guarding the garments of those who slew him .
44022021	And the Lord said to me , Go , for I will send you far away unto the Gentiles ( nations ) .
44022022	Up to the moment that Paul made this last statement , the people listened to him ; but now they raised their voices and shouted , Away with such a fellow from the earth ! He is not fit to live !
44022023	And as they were shouting and tossing and waving their garments and throwing dust into the air ,
44022024	The commandant ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks , and that he be examined by scourging in order that [ the commandant ] might learn why the people cried out thus against him .
44022025	But when they had stretched him out with the thongs ( leather straps ) , Paul asked the centurion who was standing by , Is it legal for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned [ without a trial ] ?
44022026	When the centurion heard that , he went to the commandant and said to him , What are you about to do ? This man is a Roman citizen !
44022027	So the commandant came and said to [ Paul ] , Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? And he said , Yes [ indeed ] !
44022028	The commandant replied , I purchased this citizenship [ as a capital investment ] for a big price . Paul said , But I was born [ Roman ] !
44022029	Instantly those who were about to examine and flog him withdrew from him ; and the commandant also was frightened , for he realized that [ Paul ] was a Roman citizen and he had put him in chains .
44022030	But the next day , desiring to know the real cause for which the Jews accused him , he unbound him and ordered the chief priests and all the council ( Sanhedrin ) to assemble ; and he brought Paul down and placed him before them .
44023001	THEN PAUL , gazing earnestly at the council ( Sanhedrin ) , said , Brethren , I have lived before God , doing my duty with a perfectly good conscience until this very day [ as a citizen , a true and loyal Jew ] .
44023002	At this the high priest Ananias ordered those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , God is about to strike you , you whitewashed wall ! Do you sit as a judge to try me in accordance with the Law , and yet in defiance of the Law you order me to be struck ?
44023004	Those who stood near exclaimed , Do you rail at and insult the high priest of God ?
44023005	And Paul said , I was not conscious , brethren , that he was a high priest ; for the Scripture says , You shall not speak ill of a ruler of your people .
44023006	But Paul , when he perceived that one part of them were Sadducees and the other part Pharisees , cried out to the council ( Sanhedrin ) , Brethren , I am a Pharisee , a son of Pharisees ; it is with regard to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am indicted and being judged .
44023007	So when he had said this , an angry dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees ; and the whole [ crowded ] assemblage was divided [ into two factions ] .
44023008	For the Sadducees hold that there is no resurrection , nor angel nor spirit , but the Pharisees declare openly and speak out freely , acknowledging [ their belief in ] them both .
44023009	Then a great uproar ensued , and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ party stood up and thoroughly fought the case , [ contending fiercely ] and declaring , We find nothing evil or wrong in this man . But if a spirit or an angel [ really ] spoke to him -- ? Let us not fight against God !
44023010	And when the strife became more and more tense and violent , the commandant , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , ordered the troops to go down and take him forcibly from among them and conduct him back into the barracks .
44023011	And [ that same ] following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said , Take courage , Paul , for as you have borne faithful witness concerning Me at Jerusalem , so you must also bear witness at Rome .
44023012	Now when daylight came , the Jews formed a plot and bound themselves by an oath and under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they had done away with Paul .
44023013	There were more than forty [ men of them ] , who formed this conspiracy [ swearing together this oath and curse ] .
44023014	And they went to the chief priests and elders , saying , We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath and under a curse not to taste any food until we have slain Paul .
44023015	So now you , along with the council ( Sanhedrin ) , give notice to the commandant to bring [ Paul ] down to you , as if you were going to investigate his case more accurately . But we [ ourselves ] are ready to slay him before he comes near .
44023016	But the son of Paul’s sister heard of their intended attack , and he went and got into the barracks and told Paul .
44023017	Then Paul , calling in one of the centurions , said , Take this young man to the commandant , for he has something to report to him .
44023018	So he took him and conducted him to the commandant and said , Paul the prisoner called me to him and requested me to conduct this young man to you , for he has something to report to you .
44023019	The commandant took him by the hand , and going aside with him , asked privately , What is it that you have to report to me ?
44023020	And he replied , The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council ( Sanhedrin ) tomorrow , as if [ they were ] intending to examine him more exactly .
44023021	But do not yield to their persuasion , for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush waiting for him , having bound themselves by an oath and under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him ; and even now they are all ready , [ just ] waiting for your promise .
44023022	So the commandant sent the youth away , charging him , Do not disclose to anyone that you have given me this information .
44023023	Then summoning two of the centurions , he said , Have two hundred footmen ready by the third hour of the night ( about 9:00 p.m. ) to go as far as Caesarea , with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen .
44023024	Also provide beasts for mounts for Paul to ride , and bring him in safety to Felix the governor .
44023025	And he wrote a letter having this message :
44023026	Claudius Lysias sends greetings to His Excellency Felix the governor .
44023027	This man was seized [ as prisoner ] by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him , because I learned that he is a Roman citizen .
44023028	And wishing to know the exact accusation which they were making against him , I brought him down before their council ( Sanhedrin ) ,
44023029	[ Where ] I found that he was charged in regard to questions of their own law , but he was accused of nothing that would call for death or [ even ] for imprisonment .
44023030	[ However ] when it was pointed out to me that there would be a conspiracy against the man , I sent him to you immediately , directing his accusers also to present before you their charge against him .
44023031	So the soldiers , in compliance with their instructions , took Paul and conducted him during the night to Antipatris .
44023032	And the next day they returned to the barracks , leaving the mounted men to proceed with him .
44023033	When these came to Caesarea and gave the letter to the governor , they also presented Paul before him .
44023034	Having read the letter , he asked to what province [ Paul ] belonged . When he discovered that he was from Cilicia [ an imperial province ] ,
44023035	He said , I will hear your case fully when your accusers also have come . And he ordered that an eye be kept on him in Herod’s palace ( the Praetorium ) .
44024001	FIVE DAYS later , the high priest Ananias came down [ from Jerusalem to Caesarea ] with some elders and a certain forensic advocate Tertullus [ acting as spokesman and counsel ] . They presented to the governor their evidence against Paul .
44024002	And when he was called , Tertullus began the complaint [ against him ] by saying : Since through you we obtain and enjoy much peace , and since by your foresight and provision wonderful reforms ( amendments and improvements ) are introduced and effected on behalf of this nation ,
44024003	In every way and in every place , most excellent Felix , we accept and acknowledge this with deep appreciation and with all gratitude .
44024004	But not to hinder or detain you too long , I beg you in your clemency and courtesy and kindness to grant us a brief and concise hearing .
44024005	For we have found this man a perfect pest ( a real plague ) , an agitator and source of disturbance to all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the [ heretical , division-producing ] sect of the Nazarenes .
44024006	He also [ even ] tried to desecrate and defile the temple , but we laid hands on him and would have sentenced him by our Law ,
44024007	But the commandant Lysias came and took him from us with violence and force ,
44024008	And ordered his accusers to present themselves to you . By examining and cross-questioning him yourself , you will be able to ascertain the truth from him about all these things with which we charge him .
44024009	The Jews also agreed and joined in the accusation , declaring that all these things were exactly so .
44024010	And when the governor had beckoned to Paul to speak , he answered : Because I know that for many years you have been a judge over this nation , I find it easier to make my defense and do it cheerfully and with good courage .
44024011	As you can readily verify , it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship ;
44024012	And neither in the temple nor in the synagogues nor in the city did they find me disputing with anybody or bringing together a seditious crowd .
44024013	Neither can they present argument or evidence to prove to you what they now bring against me .
44024014	But this I confess to you , however , that in accordance with the Way [ of the Lord ] , which they call a [ heretical , division-producing ] sect , I worship ( serve ) the God of our fathers , still persuaded of the truth of and believing in and placing full confidence in everything laid down in the Law [ of Moses ] or written in the prophets ;
44024015	Having [ the same ] hope in God which these themselves hold and look for , that there is to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous ( the just and the unjust ) .
44024016	Therefore I always exercise and discipline myself [ mortifying my body , deadening my carnal affections , bodily appetites , and worldly desires , endeavoring in all respects ] to have a clear ( unshaken , blameless ) conscience , void of offense toward God and toward men .
44024017	Now after several years I came up [ to Jerusalem ] to bring to my people contributions of charity and offerings .
44024018	While I was engaged in presenting these , they found me [ occupied in the rites of purification ] in the temple , without any crowd or uproar . But some Jews from [ the province of ] Asia [ were there ] ,
44024019	Who ought to be here before you and to present their charges , if they have anything against me .
44024020	Or else let these men themselves tell of what crime or wrongdoing they found me guilty when I appeared before the council ( Sanhedrin ) ,
44024021	Unless it be this one sentence which I cried out as I stood among them , In regard to the resurrection of the dead I am indicted and on trial before you this day !
44024022	But Felix , having a rather accurate understanding of the Way [ of the Lord ] , put them off and adjourned the trial , saying , When Lysias the commandant comes down , I will determine your case more fully .
44024023	Then he ordered the centurion to keep [ Paul ] in custody , but to treat him with indulgence [ giving him some liberty ] and not to hinder his friends from ministering to his needs and serving him .
44024024	Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla , who was a Jewess ; and he sent for Paul and listened to him [ talk ] about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	But as he continued to argue about uprightness , purity of life ( the control of the passions ) , and the judgment to come , Felix became alarmed and terrified and said , Go away for the present ; when I have a convenient opportunity , I will send for you .
44024026	At the same time he hoped to get money from Paul , for which reason he continued to send for him and was in his company and conversed with him often .
44024027	But when two years had gone by , Felix was succeeded in office by Porcius Festus ; and wishing to gain favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul still a prisoner in chains .
44025001	NOW WHEN Festus had entered into his own province , after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
44025002	And [ there ] the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid charges before him against Paul , and they kept begging and urging him ,
44025003	Asking as a favor that he would have him brought to Jerusalem ; [ meanwhile ] they were planning an ambush to slay him on the way .
44025004	Festus answered that Paul was in custody in Caesarea and that he himself planned to leave for there soon .
44025005	So , said he , let those who are in a position of authority and are influential among you go down with me , and if there is anything amiss or criminal about the man , let them so charge him .
44025006	So when Festus had remained among them not more than eight or ten days , he went down to Caesarea , took his seat the next day on the judgment bench , and ordered Paul to be brought before him .
44025007	And when he arrived , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood all around him , bringing many grave accusations against him which they were not able to prove .
44025008	Paul declared in [ his own ] defense , Neither against the Law of the Jews , nor against the temple , nor against Caesar have I offended in any way .
44025009	But Festus , wishing to ingratiate himself with the Jews , answered Paul , Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be put on trial [ before the Jewish Sanhedrin ] in my presence concerning these charges ?
44025010	But Paul replied , I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat , where I ought to be tried . To the Jews I have done no wrong , as you know better [ than your question implies ] .
44025011	If then I am a wrongdoer and a criminal and have committed anything for which I deserve to die , I do not beg off and seek to escape death ; but if there is no ground for their accusations against me , no one can give me up and make a present of me [ give me up freely ] to them . I appeal to Caesar .
44025012	Then Festus , when he had consulted with the [ men who formed his ] council , answered , You have appealed to Caesar ; to Caesar you shall go .
44025013	Now after an interval of some days , Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus [ to welcome him and wish him well ] .
44025014	And while they remained there for many days , Festus acquainted the king with Paul’s case , telling him , There is a man left a prisoner in chains by Felix ;
44025015	And when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him , petitioning for a judicial hearing and condemnation of him .
44025016	But I replied to them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up freely any man for punishment before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to defend himself concerning the charge brought against him .
44025017	So when they came here together , I did not delay , but on the morrow took my place on the judgment seat and ordered that the man be brought before me .
44025018	[ But ] when the accusers stood up , they brought forward no accusation [ in his case ] of any such misconduct as I was expecting .
44025019	Instead they had some points of controversy with him about their own religion or superstition and concerning one Jesus , Who had died but Whom Paul kept asserting [ over and over ] to be alive .
44025020	And I , being puzzled to know how to make inquiries into such questions , asked whether he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and there be tried regarding them .
44025021	But when Paul had appealed to have his case retained for examination and decision by the emperor , I ordered that he be detained until I could send him to Caesar .
44025022	Then Agrippa said to Festus , I also desire to hear the man myself . Tomorrow , [ Festus ] replied , you shall hear him .
44025023	So the next day Agrippa and Bernice approached with great display , and they went into the audience hall accompanied by the military commandants and the prominent citizens of the city . At the order of Festus Paul was brought in .
44025024	Then Festus said , King Agrippa and all the men present with us , you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people came to me and complained , both at Jerusalem and here , insisting and shouting that he ought not to live any longer .
44025025	But I found nothing that he had done deserving of death . Still , as he himself appealed to the emperor , I determined to send him to Rome .
44025026	[ However ] I have nothing in particular and definite to write to my lord concerning him . So I have brought him before all of you , and especially before you , King Agrippa , so that after [ further ] examination has been made , I may have something to put in writing .
44025027	For it seems to me senseless and absurd to send a prisoner and not state the accusations against him .
44026001	THEN AGRIPPA said to Paul , You are permitted to speak on your own behalf . At that Paul stretched forth his hand and made his defense [ as follows ] :
44026002	I consider myself fortunate , King Agrippa , that it is before you that I am to make my defense today in regard to all the charges brought against me by [ the ] Jews ,
44026003	[ Especially ] because you are so fully and unusually conversant with all the Jewish customs and controversies ; therefore , I beg you to hear me patiently .
44026004	My behavior and manner of living from my youth up is known by all the Jews ; [ they are aware ] that from [ its ] commencement my youth was spent among my own race in Jerusalem .
44026005	They have had knowledge of me for a long time , if they are willing to testify to it , that in accordance with the strictest sect of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee .
44026006	And now I stand here on trial [ to be judged on the ground ] of the hope of that promise made to our forefathers by God ,
44026007	Which hope [ of the Messiah and the resurrection ] our twelve tribes confidently expect to realize as they fervently worship [ without ceasing ] night and day . And for that hope , O king , I am accused by Jews and considered a criminal !
44026008	Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead ?
44026009	I myself indeed was [ once ] persuaded that it was my duty to do many things contrary to and in defiance of the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	And that is what I did in Jerusalem ; I [ not only ] locked up many of the [ faithful ] saints ( holy ones ) in prison by virtue of authority received from the chief priests , but when they were being condemned to death , I cast my vote against them .
44026011	And frequently I punished them in all the synagogues to make them blaspheme ; and in my bitter fury against them , I harassed ( troubled , molested , persecuted ) and pursued them even to foreign cities .
44026012	Thus engaged I proceeded to Damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests ,
44026013	When on the road at midday , O king , I saw a light from heaven surpassing the brightness of the sun , flashing about me and those who were traveling with me .
44026014	And when we had all fallen to the ground , I heard a voice in the Hebrew tongue saying to me , Saul , Saul , why do you continue to persecute Me [ to harass and trouble and molest Me ] ? It is dangerous and turns out badly for you to keep kicking against the goads [ to keep offering vain and perilous resistance ] .
44026015	And I said , Who are You , Lord ? And the Lord said , I am Jesus , Whom you are persecuting .
44026016	But arise and stand upon your feet ; for I have appeared to you for this purpose , that I might appoint you to serve as [ My ] minister and to bear witness both to what you have seen of Me and to that in which I will appear to you ,
44026017	Choosing you out [ selecting you for Myself ] and delivering you from among this [ Jewish ] people and the Gentiles to whom I am sending you --
44026018	To open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , so that they may thus receive forgiveness and release from their sins and a place and portion among those who are consecrated and purified by faith in Me .
44026019	Wherefore , O King Agrippa , I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision ,
44026020	But made known openly first of all to those at Damascus , then at Jerusalem and throughout the whole land of Judea , and also among the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works and live lives consistent with and worthy of their repentance .
44026021	Because of these things the Jews seized me in the temple [ enclosure ] and tried to do away with me .
44026022	[ But ] to this day I have had the help which comes from God [ as my ally ] , and so I stand here testifying to small and great alike , asserting nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses declared would come to pass --
44026023	That the Christ ( the Anointed One ) must suffer and that He , by being the first to rise from the dead , would declare and show light both to the [ Jewish ] people and to the Gentiles .
44026024	And as he thus proceeded with his defense , Festus called out loudly , Paul , you are mad ! Your great learning is driving you insane !
44026025	But Paul replied , I am not mad , most noble Festus , but I am uttering the straight , sound truth .
44026026	For the king understands about these things well enough , and [ therefore ] to him I speak with bold frankness and confidence . I am convinced that not one of these things has escaped his notice , for all this did not take place in a corner [ in secret ] .
44026027	King Agrippa , do you believe the prophets ? [ Do you give credence to God’s messengers and their words ? ] I perceive and know that you do believe .
44026028	Then Agrippa said to Paul , You think it a small task to make a Christian of me [ just offhand to induce me with little ado and persuasion , at very short notice ] .
44026029	And Paul replied , Whether short or long , I would to God that not only you , but also all who are listening to me today , might become such as I am , except for these chains .
44026030	Then the king arose , and the governor and Bernice and all those who were seated with them ;
44026031	And after they had gone out , they said to one another , This man is doing nothing deserving of death or [ even ] of imprisonment .
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar .
44027001	NOW WHEN it was determined that we [ including Luke ] should sail for Italy , they turned Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion of the imperial regiment named Julius .
44027002	And going aboard a ship from Adramyttium which was about to sail for the ports along the coast of [ the province of ] Asia , we put out to sea ; and Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica , accompanied us .
44027003	The following day we landed at Sidon , and Julius treated Paul in a loving way , with much consideration ( kindness and care ) , permitting him to go to his friends [ there ] and be refreshed and be cared for .
44027004	After putting to sea from there we passed to the leeward ( south side ) of Cyprus [ for protection ] , for the winds were contrary to us .
44027005	And when we had sailed over [ the whole length ] of sea which lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia , we reached Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy , and he transferred us to it .
44027007	For a number of days we made slow progress and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus ; then , as the wind did not permit us to proceed , we went under the lee ( shelter ) of Crete off Salmone ,
44027008	And coasting along it with difficulty , we arrived at a place called Fair Havens , near which is located the town of Lasea .
44027009	But as [ the season was well advanced , for ] much time had been lost and navigation was already dangerous , for the time for the Fast [ the Day of Atonement , about the beginning of October ] had already gone by , Paul warned and advised them ,
44027010	Saying , Sirs , I perceive [ after careful observation ] that this voyage will be attended with disaster and much heavy loss , not only of the cargo and the ship but of our lives also .
44027011	However , the centurion paid greater attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said .
44027012	And as the harbor was not well situated and so unsuitable to winter in , the majority favored the plan of putting to sea again from there , hoping somehow to reach Phoenice , a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest , and winter there .
44027013	So when the south wind blew softly , supposing they were gaining their object , they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete , hugging the coast .
44027014	But soon afterward a violent wind [ of the character of a typhoon ] , called a northeaster , came bursting down from the island .
44027015	And when the ship was caught and was unable to head against the wind , we gave up and , letting her drift , were borne along .
44027016	We ran under the shelter of a small island called Cauda , where we managed with [ much ] difficulty to draw the [ ship’s small ] boat on deck and secure it .
44027017	After hoisting it on board , they used supports with ropes to undergird and brace the ship ; then afraid that they would be driven into the Syrtis [ quicksands off the north coast of Africa ] , they lowered the gear ( sails and ropes ) and so were driven along .
44027018	As we were being dangerously tossed about by the violence of the storm , the next day they began to throw the freight overboard ;
44027019	And the third day they threw out with their own hands the ship’s equipment ( the tackle and the furniture ) .
44027020	And when neither sun nor stars were visible for many days and no small tempest kept raging about us , all hope of our being saved was finally abandoned .
44027021	Then as they had eaten nothing for a long time , Paul came forward into their midst and said , Men , you should have listened to me , and should not have put to sea from Crete and brought on this disaster and harm and misery and loss .
44027022	But [ even ] now I beg you to be in good spirits and take heart , for there will be no loss of life among you but only of the ship .
44027023	For this [ very ] night there stood by my side an angel of the God to Whom I belong and Whom I serve and worship ,
44027024	And he said , Do not be frightened , Paul ! It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar ; and behold , God has given you all those who are sailing with you .
44027025	So keep up your courage , men , for I have faith ( complete confidence ) in God that it will be exactly as it was told me ;
44027026	But we shall have to be stranded on some island .
44027027	The fourteenth night had come and we were drifting and being driven about in the Adriatic Sea , when about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were drawing near to some land .
44027028	So they took soundings and found twenty fathoms , and a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms .
44027029	Then fearing that we might fall off [ our course ] onto rocks , they dropped four anchors from the stern and kept wishing for daybreak to come .
44027030	And as the sailors were trying to escape [ secretly ] from the ship and were lowering the small boat into the sea , pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow ,
44027031	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers , Unless these men remain in the ship , you cannot be saved .
44027032	Then the soldiers cut away the ropes that held the small boat , and let it fall and drift away .
44027033	While they waited until it should become day , Paul entreated them all to take some food , saying , This is the fourteenth day that you have been continually in suspense and on the alert without food , having eaten nothing .
44027034	So I urge ( warn , exhort , encourage , advise ) you to take some food [ for your safety ] -- it will give you strength ; for not a hair is to perish from the head of any one of you .
44027035	Having said these words , he took bread and , giving thanks to God before them all , he broke it and began to eat .
44027036	Then they all became more cheerful and were encouraged and took food themselves .
44027037	All told there were 276 souls of us in the ship .
44027038	And after they had eaten sufficiently , [ they proceeded ] to lighten the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
44027039	Now when it was day [ and they saw the land ] , they did not recognize it , but they noticed a bay with a beach on which they [ taking counsel ] purposed to run the ship ashore if they possibly could .
44027040	So they cut the cables and severed the anchors and left them in the sea ; at the same time unlashing the ropes that held the rudders and hoisting the foresail to the wind , they headed for the beach .
44027041	But striking a crosscurrent ( a place open to two seas ) they ran the ship aground . The prow stuck fast and remained immovable , and the stern began to break up under the violent force of the waves .
44027042	It was the counsel of the soldiers to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim to land and escape ;
44027043	But the centurion , wishing to save Paul , prevented their carrying out their purpose . He commanded those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the shore ,
44027044	And the rest on heavy boards or pieces of the vessel . And so it was that all escaped safely to land .
44028001	AFTER WE were safe on the island , we knew and recognized that it was called Malta .
44028002	And the natives showed us unusual and remarkable kindness , for they kindled a fire and welcomed and received us all , since it had begun to rain and was cold .
44028003	Now Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and he was laying them on the fire when a viper crawled out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand .
44028004	When the natives saw the little animal hanging from his hand , they said to one another , Doubtless this man is a murderer , for though he has been saved from the sea , Justice [ the goddess of avenging ] has not permitted that he should live .
44028005	Then [ Paul simply ] shook off the small creature into the fire and suffered no evil effects .
44028006	However , they were waiting , expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead ; but when they had watched him a long time and saw nothing fatal or harmful come to him , they changed their minds and kept saying over and over that he was a god .
44028007	In the vicinity of that place there were estates belonging to the head man of the island , named Publius , who accepted and welcomed and entertained us with hearty hospitality for three days .
44028008	And it happened that the father of Publius was sick in bed with recurring attacks of fever and dysentery ; and Paul went to see him , and after praying and laying his hands on him , he healed him .
44028009	After this had occurred , the other people on the island who had diseases also kept coming and were cured .
44028010	They showed us every respect and presented many gifts to us , honoring us with many honors ; and when we sailed , they provided and put on [ board our ship ] everything we needed .
44028011	It was after three months’ stay there that we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island , an Alexandrian ship with the Twin Brothers [ Castor and Pollux ] as its figurehead .
44028012	We landed at Syracuse and remained there three days ,
44028013	And from there we made a circuit [ following the coast ] and reached Rhegium ; and one day later a south wind sprang up , and the next day we arrived at Puteoli .
44028014	There we found some [ Christian ] brethren and were entreated to stay with them for seven days . And so we came to Rome .
44028015	And the [ Christian ] brethren there , having had news of us , came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us . When Paul saw them , he thanked God and received new courage .
44028016	When we arrived at Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was permitted to live by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
44028017	Three days after [ our arrival ] , he called together the leading local Jews ; and when they had gathered , he said to them , Brethren , though I have done nothing against the people or against the customs of our forefathers , yet I was turned over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans .
44028018	After they had examined me , they were ready to release me because I was innocent of any offense deserving the death penalty .
44028019	But when the Jews protested , I was forced to appeal to Caesar , though it was not because I had any charge to make against my nation .
44028020	This is the reason therefore why I have begged to see you and to talk with you , since it is because of the Hope of Israel ( the Messiah ) that I am bound with this chain .
44028021	And they answered him , We have not received any letters about you from Judea , and none of the [ Jewish ] brethren coming here has reported or spoken anything evil about you .
44028022	But we think it fitting and are eager to hear from you what it is that you have in mind and believe and what your opinion is , for with regard to this sect it is known to all of us that it is everywhere denounced .
44028023	So when they had set a day with him , they came in large numbers to his lodging . And he fully set forth and explained the matter to them from morning until night , testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets .
44028024	And some were convinced and believed what he said , and others did not believe .
44028025	And as they disagreed among themselves , they began to leave , [ but not before ] Paul had added one statement [ more ] : The Holy Spirit was right in saying through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers :
44028026	Go to this people and say to them , You will indeed hear and hear with your ears but will not understand , and you will indeed look and look with your eyes but will not see [ not perceive , have knowledge of or become acquainted with what you look at , at all ] .
44028027	For the heart ( the understanding , the soul ) of this people has grown dull ( stupid , hardened , and calloused ) , and their ears are heavy and hard of hearing and they have shut tight their eyes , so that they may not perceive and have knowledge and become acquainted with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their souls and turn [ to Me and be converted ] , that I may heal them .
44028028	So let it be understood by you then that [ this message of ] the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles , and they will listen [ to it ] !
44028029	And when he had said these things , the Jews went away , arguing and disputing among themselves .
44028030	After this Paul lived there for two entire years [ at his own expense ] in his own rented lodging , and he welcomed all who came to him ,
44028031	Preaching to them the kingdom of God and teaching them about the Lord Jesus Christ with boldness and quite openly , and without being molested or hindered .
45001001	FROM PAUL , a bond servant of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) called to be an apostle , ( a special messenger ) set apart to [ preach ] the Gospel ( good news ) of and from God ,
45001002	Which He promised in advance [ long ago ] through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures --
45001003	[ The Gospel ] regarding His Son , Who as to the flesh ( His human nature ) was descended from David ,
45001004	And [ as to His divine nature ] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly designated the Son of God in power [ in a striking , triumphant and miraculous manner ] by His resurrection from the dead , even Jesus Christ our Lord ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
45001005	It is through Him that we have received grace ( God’s unmerited favor ) and [ our ] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith and make disciples for His name’s sake among all the nations ,
45001006	And this includes you , called of Jesus Christ and invited [ as you are ] to belong to Him .
45001007	To [ you then ] all God’s beloved ones in Rome , called to be saints and designated for a consecrated life : Grace and spiritual blessing and peace be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because [ the report of ] your faith is made known to all the world and is commended everywhere .
45001009	For God is my witness , Whom I serve with my [ whole ] spirit [ rendering priestly and spiritual service ] in [ preaching ] the Gospel and [ telling ] the good news of His Son , how incessantly I always mention you when at my prayers .
45001010	I keep pleading that somehow by God’s will I may now at last prosper and come to you .
45001011	For I am yearning to see you , that I may impart and share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen and establish you ;
45001012	That is , that we may be mutually strengthened and encouraged and comforted by each other’s faith , both yours and mine .
45001013	I want you to know , brethren , that many times I have planned and intended to come to you , though thus far I have been hindered and prevented , in order that I might have some fruit ( some result of my labors ) among you , as I have among the rest of the Gentiles .
45001014	Both to Greeks and to barbarians ( to the cultured and to the uncultured ) , both to the wise and the foolish , I have an obligation to discharge and a duty to perform and a debt to pay .
45001015	So , for my part , I am willing and eagerly ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the Gospel ( good news ) of Christ , for it is God’s power working unto salvation [ for deliverance from eternal death ] to everyone who believes with a personal trust and a confident surrender and firm reliance , to the Jew first and also to the Greek ,
45001017	For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed , both springing from faith and leading to faith [ disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith ] . As it is written , The man who through faith is just and upright shall live and shall live by faith .
45001018	For God’s [ holy ] wrath and indignation are revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who in their wickedness repress and hinder the truth and make it inoperative .
45001019	For that which is known about God is evident to them and made plain in their inner consciousness , because God [ Himself ] has shown it to them .
45001020	For ever since the creation of the world His invisible nature and attributes , that is , His eternal power and divinity , have been made intelligible and clearly discernible in and through the things that have been made ( His handiworks ) . So [ men ] are without excuse [ altogether without any defense or justification ] ,
45001021	Because when they knew and recognized Him as God , they did not honor and glorify Him as God or give Him thanks . But instead they became futile and godless in their thinking [ with vain imaginings , foolish reasoning , and stupid speculations ] and their senseless minds were darkened .
45001022	Claiming to be wise , they became fools [ professing to be smart , they made simpletons of themselves ] .
45001023	And by them the glory and majesty and excellence of the immortal God were exchanged for and represented by images , resembling mortal man and birds and beasts and reptiles .
45001024	Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their [ own ] hearts to sexual impurity , to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves [ abandoning them to the degrading power of sin ] ,
45001025	Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , Who is blessed forever ! Amen ( so be it ) .
45001026	For this reason God gave them over and abandoned them to vile affections and degrading passions . For their women exchanged their natural function for an unnatural and abnormal one ,
45001027	And the men also turned from natural relations with women and were set ablaze ( burning out , consumed ) with lust for one another -- men committing shameful acts with men and suffering in their own bodies and personalities the inevitable consequences and penalty of their wrong-doing and going astray , which was [ their ] fitting retribution .
45001028	And so , since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or approve of Him or consider Him worth the knowing , God gave them over to a base and condemned mind to do things not proper or decent but loathsome ,
45001029	Until they were filled ( permeated and saturated ) with every kind of unrighteousness , iniquity , grasping and covetous greed , and malice . [ They were ] full of envy and jealousy , murder , strife , deceit and treachery , ill will and cruel ways . [ They were ] secret backbiters and gossipers ,
45001030	Slanderers , hateful to and hating God , full of insolence , arrogance , [ and ] boasting ; inventors of new forms of evil , disobedient and undutiful to parents .
45001031	[ They were ] without understanding , conscienceless and faithless , heartless and loveless [ and ] merciless .
45001032	Though they are fully aware of God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve to die , they not only do them themselves but approve and applaud others who practice them .
45002001	THEREFORE YOU have no excuse or defense or justification , O man , whoever you are who judges and condemns another . For in posing as judge and passing sentence on another , you condemn yourself , because you who judge are habitually practicing the very same things [ that you censure and denounce ] .
45002002	[ But ] we know that the judgment ( adverse verdict , sentence ) of God falls justly and in accordance with truth upon those who practice such things .
45002003	And do you think or imagine , O man , when you judge and condemn those who practice such things and yet do them yourself , that you will escape God’s judgment and elude His sentence and adverse verdict ?
45002004	Or are you [ so blind as to ] trifle with and presume upon and despise and underestimate the wealth of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering patience ? Are you unmindful or actually ignorant [ of the fact ] that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repent ( to change your mind and inner man to accept God’s will ) ?
45002005	But by your callous stubbornness and impenitence of heart you are storing up wrath and indignation for yourself on the day of wrath and indignation , when God’s righteous judgment ( just doom ) will be revealed .
45002006	For He will render to every man according to his works [ justly , as his deeds deserve ] :
45002007	To those who by patient persistence in well-doing [ springing from piety ] seek [ unseen but sure ] glory and honor and [ the eternal blessedness of ] immortality , He will give eternal life .
45002008	But for those who are self-seeking and self-willed and disobedient to the Truth but responsive to wickedness , there will be indignation and wrath .
45002009	[ And ] there will be tribulation and anguish and calamity and constraint for every soul of man who [ habitually ] does evil , the Jew first and also the Greek ( Gentile ) .
45002010	But glory and honor and [ heart ] peace shall be awarded to everyone who [ habitually ] does good , the Jew first and also the Greek ( Gentile ) .
45002011	For God shows no partiality [ undue favor or unfairness ; with Him one man is not different from another ] .
45002012	All who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [ regard to ] the Law , and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged and condemned by the Law .
45002013	For it is not merely hearing the Law [ read ] that makes one righteous before God , but it is the doers of the Law who will be held guiltless and acquitted and justified .
45002014	When Gentiles who have not the [ divine ] Law do instinctively what the Law requires , they are a law to themselves , since they do not have the Law .
45002015	They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts and are operating there , with which their consciences ( sense of right and wrong ) also bear witness ; and their [ moral ] decisions ( their arguments of reason , their condemning or approving thoughts ) will accuse or perhaps defend and excuse [ them ]
45002016	On that day when , as my Gospel proclaims , God by Jesus Christ will judge men in regard to the things which they conceal ( their hidden thoughts ) .
45002017	But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law and pride yourselves in God and your relationship to Him ,
45002018	And know and understand His will and discerningly approve the better things and have a sense of what is vital , because you are instructed by the Law ;
45002019	And if you are confident that you [ yourself ] are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness , and [ that
45002020	You are ] a corrector of the foolish , a teacher of the childish , having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth --
45002021	Well then , you who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? While you teach against stealing , do you steal ( take what does not really belong to you ) ?
45002022	You who say not to commit adultery , do you commit adultery [ are you unchaste in action or in thought ] ? You who abhor and loathe idols , do you rob temples [ do you appropriate to your own use what is consecrated to God , thus robbing the sanctuary and doing sacrilege ] ?
45002023	You who boast in the Law , do you dishonor God by breaking the Law [ by stealthily infringing upon or carelessly neglecting or openly breaking it ] ?
45002024	For , as it is written , The name of God is maligned and blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you ! [ The words to this effect are from your own Scriptures . ]
45002025	Circumcision does indeed profit if you keep the Law ; but if you habitually transgress the Law , your circumcision is made uncircumcision .
45002026	So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law , will not his uncircumcision be credited to him as [ equivalent to ] circumcision ?
45002027	Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the Law will condemn you who , although you have the code in writing and have circumcision , break the Law .
45002028	For he is not a [ real ] Jew who is only one outwardly and publicly , nor is [ true ] circumcision something external and physical .
45002029	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly , and [ true ] circumcision is of the heart , a spiritual and not a literal [ matter ] . His praise is not from men but from God .
45003001	THEN WHAT advantage remains to the Jew ? [ How is he favored ? ] Or what is the value or benefit of circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way . To begin with , to the Jews were entrusted the oracles ( the brief communications , the intentions , the utterances ) of God .
45003003	What if some did not believe and were without faith ? Does their lack of faith and their faithlessness nullify and make ineffective and void the faithfulness of God and His fidelity [ to His Word ] ?
45003004	By no means ! Let God be found true though every human being is false and a liar , as it is written , That You may be justified and shown to be upright in what You say , and prevail when You are judged [ by sinful men ] .
45003005	But if our unrighteousness thus establishes and exhibits the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? That God is unjust and wrong to inflict His wrath upon us [ Jews ] ? I speak in a [ purely ] human way .
45003006	By no means ! Otherwise , how could God judge the world ?
45003007	But [ you say ] if through my falsehood God’s integrity is magnified and advertised and abounds to His glory , why am I still being judged as a sinner ?
45003008	And why should we not do evil that good may come ? -- as some slanderously charge us with teaching . Such [ false teaching ] is justly condemned by them .
45003009	Well then , are we [ Jews ] superior and better off than they ? No , not at all . We have already charged that all men , both Jews and Greeks ( Gentiles ) , are under sin [ held down by and subject to its power and control ] .
45003010	As it is written , None is righteous , just and truthful and upright and conscientious , no , not one .
45003011	No one understands [ no one intelligently discerns or comprehends ] ; no one seeks out God .
45003012	All have turned aside ; together they have gone wrong and have become unprofitable and worthless ; no one does right , not even one !
45003013	Their throat is a yawning grave ; they use their tongues to deceive ( to mislead and to deal treacherously ) . The venom of asps is beneath their lips .
45003014	Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness .
45003015	Their feet are swift to shed blood .
45003016	Destruction [ as it dashes them to pieces ] and misery mark their ways .
45003017	And they have no experience of the way of peace [ they know nothing about peace , for a peaceful way they do not even recognize ] .
45003018	There is no [ reverential ] fear of God before their eyes .
45003019	Now we know that whatever the Law says , it speaks to those who are under the Law , so that [ the murmurs and excuses of ] every mouth may be hushed and all the world may be held accountable to God .
45003020	For no person will be justified ( made righteous , acquitted , and judged acceptable ) in His sight by observing the works prescribed by the Law . For [ the real function of ] the Law is to make men recognize and be conscious of sin [ not mere perception , but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance , faith , and holy character ] .
45003021	But now the righteousness of God has been revealed independently and altogether apart from the Law , although actually it is attested by the Law and the Prophets ,
45003022	Namely , the righteousness of God which comes by believing with personal trust and confident reliance on Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . [ And it is meant ] for all who believe . For there is no distinction ,
45003023	Since all have sinned and are falling short of the honor and glory which God bestows and receives .
45003024	[ All ] are justified and made upright and in right standing with God , freely and gratuitously by His grace ( His unmerited favor and mercy ) , through the redemption which is [ provided ] in Christ Jesus ,
45003025	Whom God put forward [ before the eyes of all ] as a mercy seat and propitiation by His blood [ the cleansing and life-giving sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation , to be received ] through faith . This was to show God’s righteousness , because in His divine forbearance He had passed over and ignored former sins without punishment .
45003026	It was to demonstrate and prove at the present time ( in the now season ) that He Himself is righteous and that He justifies and accepts as righteous him who has [ true ] faith in Jesus .
45003027	Then what becomes of [ our ] pride and [ our ] boasting ? It is excluded ( banished , ruled out entirely ) . On what principle ? [ On the principle ] of doing good deeds ? No , but on the principle of faith .
45003028	For we hold that a man is justified and made upright by faith independent of and distinctly apart from good deeds ( works of the Law ) . [ The observance of the Law has nothing to do with justification . ]
45003029	Or is God merely [ the God ] of Jews ? Is He not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
45003030	Since it is one and the same God Who will justify the circumcised by faith [ which germinated from Abraham ] and the uncircumcised through their [ newly acquired ] faith . [ For it is the same trusting faith in both cases , a firmly relying faith in Jesus Christ ] .
45003031	Do we then by [ this ] faith make the Law of no effect , overthrow it or make it a dead letter ? Certainly not ! On the contrary , we confirm and establish and uphold the Law .
45004001	[ BUT ] IF so , what shall we say about Abraham , our forefather humanly speaking -- [ what did he ] find out ? [ How does this affect his position , and what was gained by him ? ]
45004002	For if Abraham was justified ( established as just by acquittal from guilt ) by good works [ that he did , then ] he has grounds for boasting . But not before God !
45004003	For what does the Scripture say ? Abraham believed in ( trusted in ) God , and it was credited to his account as righteousness ( right living and right standing with God ) .
45004004	Now to a laborer , his wages are not counted as a favor or a gift , but as an obligation ( something owed to him ) .
45004005	But to one who , not working [ by the Law ] , trusts ( believes fully ) in Him Who justifies the ungodly , his faith is credited to him as righteousness ( the standing acceptable to God ) .
45004006	Thus David congratulates the man and pronounces a blessing on him to whom God credits righteousness apart from the works he does :
45004007	Blessed and happy and to be envied are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered up and completely buried .
45004008	Blessed and happy and to be envied is the person of whose sin the Lord will take no account nor reckon it against him .
45004009	Is this blessing ( happiness ) then meant only for the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? We say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness .
45004010	How then was it credited [ to him ] ? Was it before or after he had been circumcised ? It was not after , but before he was circumcised .
45004011	He received the mark of circumcision as a token or an evidence [ and ] seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised -- [ faith ] so that he was to be made the father of all who [ truly ] believe , though without circumcision , and who thus have righteousness ( right standing with God ) imputed to them and credited to their account ,
45004012	As well as [ that he be made ] the father of those circumcised persons who are not merely circumcised , but also walk in the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
45004013	For the promise to Abraham or his posterity , that he should inherit the world , did not come through [ observing the commands of ] the Law but through the righteousness of faith .
45004014	If it is the adherents of the Law who are to be the heirs , then faith is made futile and empty of all meaning and the promise [ of God ] is made void ( is annulled and has no power ) .
45004015	For the Law results in [ divine ] wrath , but where there is no law there is no transgression [ of it either ] .
45004016	Therefore , [ inheriting ] the promise is the outcome of faith and depends [ entirely ] on faith , in order that it might be given as an act of grace ( unmerited favor ) , to make it stable and valid and guaranteed to all his descendants -- not only to the devotees and adherents of the Law , but also to those who share the faith of Abraham , who is [ thus ] the father of us all .
45004017	As it is written , I have made you the father of many nations . [ He was appointed our father ] in the sight of God in Whom he believed , Who gives life to the dead and speaks of the nonexistent things that [ He has foretold and promised ] as if they [ already ] existed .
45004018	[ For Abraham , human reason for ] hope being gone , hoped in faith that he should become the father of many nations , as he had been promised , So [ numberless ] shall your descendants be .
45004019	He did not weaken in faith when he considered the [ utter ] impotence of his own body , which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old , or [ when he considered ] the barrenness of Sarah’s [ deadened ] womb .
45004020	No unbelief or distrust made him waver ( doubtingly question ) concerning the promise of God , but he grew strong and was empowered by faith as he gave praise and glory to God ,
45004021	Fully satisfied and assured that God was able and mighty to keep His word and to do what He had promised .
45004022	That is why his faith was credited to him as righteousness ( right standing with God ) .
45004023	But [ the words ] , It was credited to him , were written not for his sake alone ,
45004024	But [ they were written ] for our sakes too . [ Righteousness , standing acceptable to God ] will be granted and credited to us also who believe in ( trust in , adhere to , and rely on ) God , Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
45004025	Who was betrayed and put to death because of our misdeeds and was raised to secure our justification ( our acquittal ) , [ making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God ] .
45005001	THEREFORE , SINCE we are justified ( acquitted , declared righteous , and given a right standing with God ) through faith , let us [ grasp the fact that we ] have [ the peace of reconciliation to hold and to enjoy ] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
45005002	Through Him also we have [ our ] access ( entrance , introduction ) by faith into this grace ( state of God’s favor ) in which we [ firmly and safely ] stand . And let us rejoice and exult in our hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God .
45005003	Moreover [ let us also be full of joy now ! ] let us exult and triumph in our troubles and rejoice in our sufferings , knowing that pressure and affliction and hardship produce patient and unswerving endurance .
45005004	And endurance ( fortitude ) develops maturity of character ( approved faith and tried integrity ) . And character [ of this sort ] produces [ the habit of ] joyful and confident hope of eternal salvation .
45005005	Such hope never disappoints or deludes or shames us , for God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us .
45005006	While we were yet in weakness [ powerless to help ourselves ] , at the fitting time Christ died for ( in behalf of ) the ungodly .
45005007	Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to give his life even for an upright man , though perhaps for a noble and lovable and generous benefactor someone might even dare to die .
45005008	But God shows and clearly proves His [ own ] love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners , Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) died for us .
45005009	Therefore , since we are now justified ( acquitted , made righteous , and brought into right relationship with God ) by Christ’s blood , how much more [ certain is it that ] we shall be saved by Him from the indignation and wrath of God .
45005010	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son , it is much more [ certain ] , now that we are reconciled , that we shall be saved ( daily delivered from sin’s dominion ) through His [ resurrection ] life .
45005011	Not only so , but we also rejoice and exultingly glory in God [ in His love and perfection ] through our Lord Jesus Christ , through Whom we have now received and enjoy [ our ] reconciliation .
45005012	Therefore , as sin came into the world through one man , and death as the result of sin , so death spread to all men , [ no one being able to stop it or to escape its power ] because all men sinned .
45005013	[ To be sure ] sin was in the world before ever the Law was given , but sin is not charged to men’s account where there is no law [ to transgress ] .
45005014	Yet death held sway from Adam to Moses [ the Lawgiver ] , even over those who did not themselves transgress [ a positive command ] as Adam did . Adam was a type ( prefigure ) of the One Who was to come [ in reverse , the former destructive , the Latter saving ] .
45005015	But God’s free gift is not at all to be compared to the trespass [ His grace is out of all proportion to the fall of man ] . For if many died through one man’s falling away ( his lapse , his offense ) , much more profusely did God’s grace and the free gift [ that comes ] through the undeserved favor of the one Man Jesus Christ abound and overflow to and for [ the benefit of ] many .
45005016	Nor is the free gift at all to be compared to the effect of that one [ man’s ] sin . For the sentence [ following the trespass ] of one [ man ] brought condemnation , whereas the free gift [ following ] many transgressions brings justification ( an act of righteousness ) .
45005017	For if because of one man’s trespass ( lapse , offense ) death reigned through that one , much more surely will those who receive [ God’s ] overflowing grace ( unmerited favor ) and the free gift of righteousness [ putting them into right standing with Himself ] reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
45005018	Well then , as one man’s trespass [ one man’s false step and falling away led ] to condemnation for all men , so one Man’s act of righteousness [ leads ] to acquittal and right standing with God and life for all men .
45005019	For just as by one man’s disobedience ( failing to hear , heedlessness , and carelessness ) the many were constituted sinners , so by one Man’s obedience the many will be constituted righteous ( made acceptable to God , brought into right standing with Him ) .
45005020	But then Law came in , [ only ] to expand and increase the trespass [ making it more apparent and exciting opposition ] . But where sin increased and abounded , grace ( God’s unmerited favor ) has surpassed it and increased the more and superabounded ,
45005021	So that , [ just ] as sin has reigned in death , [ so ] grace ( His unearned and undeserved favor ) might reign also through righteousness ( right standing with God ) which issues in eternal life through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) our Lord .
45006001	WHAT SHALL we say [ to all this ] ? Are we to remain in sin in order that God’s grace ( favor and mercy ) may multiply and overflow ?
45006002	Certainly not ! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer ?
45006003	Are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death ?
45006004	We were buried therefore with Him by the baptism into death , so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious [ power ] of the Father , so we too might [ habitually ] live and behave in newness of life .
45006005	For if we have become one with Him by sharing a death like His , we shall also be [ one with Him in sharing ] His resurrection [ by a new life lived for God ] .
45006006	We know that our old ( unrenewed ) self was nailed to the cross with Him in order that [ our ] body [ which is the instrument ] of sin might be made ineffective and inactive for evil , that we might no longer be the slaves of sin .
45006007	For when a man dies , he is freed ( loosed , delivered ) from [ the power of ] sin [ among men ] .
45006008	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with Him ,
45006009	Because we know that Christ ( the Anointed One ) , being once raised from the dead , will never die again ; death no longer has power over Him .
45006010	For by the death He died , He died to sin [ ending His relation to it ] once for all ; and the life that He lives , He is living to God [ in unbroken fellowship with Him ] .
45006011	Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken , but alive to God [ living in unbroken fellowship with Him ] in Christ Jesus .
45006012	Let not sin therefore rule as king in your mortal ( short-lived , perishable ) bodies , to make you yield to its cravings and be subject to its lusts and evil passions .
45006013	Do not continue offering or yielding your bodily members [ and faculties ] to sin as instruments ( tools ) of wickedness . But offer and yield yourselves to God as though you have been raised from the dead to [ perpetual ] life , and your bodily members [ and faculties ] to God , presenting them as implements of righteousness .
45006014	For sin shall not [ any longer ] exert dominion over you , since now you are not under Law [ as slaves ] , but under grace [ as subjects of God’s favor and mercy ] .
45006015	What then [ are we to conclude ] ? Shall we sin because we live not under Law but under God’s favor and mercy ? Certainly not !
45006016	Do you not know that if you continually surrender yourselves to anyone to do his will , you are the slaves of him whom you obey , whether that be to sin , which leads to death , or to obedience which leads to righteousness ( right doing and right standing with God ) ?
45006017	But thank God , though you were once slaves of sin , you have become obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed and to which you were committed .
45006018	And having been set free from sin , you have become the servants of righteousness ( of conformity to the divine will in thought , purpose , and action ) .
45006019	I am speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations . For as you yielded your bodily members [ and faculties ] as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness , so now yield your bodily members [ and faculties ] once for all as servants to righteousness ( right being and doing ) [ which leads ] to sanctification .
45006020	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
45006021	But then what benefit ( return ) did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed ? [ None ] for the end of those things is death .
45006022	But now since you have been set free from sin and have become the slaves of God , you have your present reward in holiness and its end is eternal life .
45006023	For the wages which sin pays is death , but the [ bountiful ] free gift of God is eternal life through ( in union with ) Jesus Christ our Lord .
45007001	DO YOU not know , brethren -- for I am speaking to men who are acquainted with the Law -- that legal claims have power over a person only for as long as he is alive ?
45007002	For [ instance ] a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives ; but if her husband dies , she is loosed and discharged from the law concerning her husband .
45007003	Accordingly , she will be held an adulteress if she unites herself to another man while her husband lives . But if her husband dies , the marriage law no longer is binding on her [ she is free from that law ] ; and if she unites herself to another man , she is not an adulteress .
45007004	Likewise , my brethren , you have undergone death as to the Law through the [ crucified ] body of Christ , so that now you may belong to Another , to Him Who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God .
45007005	When we were living in the flesh ( mere physical lives ) , the sinful passions that were awakened and aroused up by [ what ] the Law [ makes sin ] were constantly operating in our natural powers ( in our bodily organs , in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh ) , so that we bore fruit for death .
45007006	But now we are discharged from the Law and have terminated all intercourse with it , having died to what once restrained and held us captive . So now we serve not under [ obedience to ] the old code of written regulations , but [ under obedience to the promptings ] of the Spirit in newness [ of life ] .
45007007	What then do we conclude ? Is the Law identical with sin ? Certainly not ! Nevertheless , if it had not been for the Law , I should not have recognized sin or have known its meaning . [ For instance ] I would not have known about covetousness [ would have had no consciousness of sin or sense of guilt ] if the Law had not [ repeatedly ] said , You shall not covet and have an evil desire [ for one thing and another ] .
45007008	But sin , finding opportunity in the commandment [ to express itself ] , got a hold on me and aroused and stimulated all kinds of forbidden desires ( lust , covetousness ) . For without the Law sin is dead [ the sense of it is inactive and a lifeless thing ] .
45007009	Once I was alive , but quite apart from and unconscious of the Law . But when the commandment came , sin lived again and I died ( was sentenced by the Law to death ) .
45007010	And the very legal ordinance which was designed and intended to bring life actually proved [ to mean to me ] death .
45007011	For sin , seizing the opportunity and getting a hold on me [ by taking its incentive ] from the commandment , beguiled and entrapped and cheated me , and using it [ as a weapon ] , killed me .
45007012	The Law therefore is holy , and [ each ] commandment is holy and just and good .
45007013	Did that which is good then prove fatal [ bringing death ] to me ? Certainly not ! It was sin , working death in me by using this good thing [ as a weapon ] , in order that through the commandment sin might be shown up clearly to be sin , that the extreme malignity and immeasurable sinfulness of sin might plainly appear .
45007014	We know that the Law is spiritual ; but I am a creature of the flesh [ carnal , unspiritual ] , having been sold into slavery under [ the control of ] sin .
45007015	For I do not understand my own actions [ I am baffled , bewildered ] . I do not practice or accomplish what I wish , but I do the very thing that I loathe [ which my moral instinct condemns ] .
45007016	Now if I do [ habitually ] what is contrary to my desire , [ that means that ] I acknowledge and agree that the Law is good ( morally excellent ) and that I take sides with it .
45007017	However , it is no longer I who do the deed , but the sin [ principle ] which is at home in me and has possession of me .
45007018	For I know that nothing good dwells within me , that is , in my flesh . I can will what is right , but I cannot perform it . [ I have the intention and urge to do what is right , but no power to carry it out . ]
45007019	For I fail to practice the good deeds I desire to do , but the evil deeds that I do not desire to do are what I am [ ever ] doing .
45007020	Now if I do what I do not desire to do , it is no longer I doing it [ it is not myself that acts ] , but the sin [ principle ] which dwells within me [ fixed and operating in my soul ] .
45007021	So I find it to be a law ( rule of action of my being ) that when I want to do what is right and good , evil is ever present with me and I am subject to its insistent demands .
45007022	For I endorse and delight in the Law of God in my inmost self [ with my new nature ] .
45007023	But I discern in my bodily members [ in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh ] a different law ( rule of action ) at war against the law of my mind ( my reason ) and making me a prisoner to the law of sin that dwells in my bodily organs [ in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh ] .
45007024	O unhappy and pitiable and wretched man that I am ! Who will release and deliver me from [ the shackles of ] this body of death ?
45007025	O thank God ! [ He will ! ] through Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) our Lord ! So then indeed I , of myself with the mind and heart , serve the Law of God , but with the flesh the law of sin .
45008001	THEREFORE , [ there is ] now no condemnation ( no adjudging guilty of wrong ) for those who are in Christ Jesus , who live [ and ] walk not after the dictates of the flesh , but after the dictates of the Spirit .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit of life [ which is ] in Christ Jesus [ the law of our new being ] has freed me from the law of sin and of death .
45008003	For God has done what the Law could not do , [ its power ] being weakened by the flesh [ the entire nature of man without the Holy Spirit ] . Sending His own Son in the guise of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin , [ God ] condemned sin in the flesh [ subdued , overcame , deprived it of its power over all who accept that sacrifice ] ,
45008004	So that the righteous and just requirement of the Law might be fully met in us who live and move not in the ways of the flesh but in the ways of the Spirit [ our lives governed not by the standards and according to the dictates of the flesh , but controlled by the Holy Spirit ] .
45008005	For those who are according to the flesh and are controlled by its unholy desires set their minds on and pursue those things which gratify the flesh , but those who are according to the Spirit and are controlled by the desires of the Spirit set their minds on and seek those things which gratify the [ Holy ] Spirit .
45008006	Now the mind of the flesh [ which is sense and reason without the Holy Spirit ] is death [ death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin , both here and hereafter ] . But the mind of the [ Holy ] Spirit is life and [ soul ] peace [ both now and forever ] .
45008007	[ That is ] because the mind of the flesh [ with its carnal thoughts and purposes ] is hostile to God , for it does not submit itself to God’s Law ; indeed it cannot .
45008008	So then those who are living the life of the flesh [ catering to the appetites and impulses of their carnal nature ] cannot please or satisfy God , or be acceptable to Him .
45008009	But you are not living the life of the flesh , you are living the life of the Spirit , if the [ Holy ] Spirit of God [ really ] dwells within you [ directs and controls you ] . But if anyone does not possess the [ Holy ] Spirit of Christ , he is none of His [ he does not belong to Christ , is not truly a child of God ] .
45008010	But if Christ lives in you , [ then although ] your [ natural ] body is dead by reason of sin and guilt , the spirit is alive because of [ the ] righteousness [ that He imputes to you ] .
45008011	And if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , [ then ] He Who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also restore to life your mortal ( short-lived , perishable ) bodies through His Spirit Who dwells in you .
45008012	So then , brethren , we are debtors , but not to the flesh [ we are not obligated to our carnal nature ] , to live [ a life ruled by the standards set up by the dictates ] of the flesh .
45008013	For if you live according to [ the dictates of ] the flesh , you will surely die . But if through the power of the [ Holy ] Spirit you are [ habitually ] putting to death ( making extinct , deadening ) the [ evil ] deeds prompted by the body , you shall [ really and genuinely ] live forever .
45008014	For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God .
45008015	For [ the Spirit which ] you have now received [ is ] not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in bondage to fear , but you have received the Spirit of adoption [ the Spirit producing sonship ] in [ the bliss of ] which we cry , Abba ( Father ) ! Father !
45008016	The Spirit Himself [ thus ] testifies together with our own spirit , [ assuring us ] that we are children of God .
45008017	And if we are [ His ] children , then we are [ His ] heirs also : heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [ sharing His inheritance with Him ] ; only we must share His suffering if we are to share His glory .
45008018	[ But what of that ? ] For I consider that the sufferings of this present time ( this present life ) are not worth being compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us and in us and for us and conferred on us !
45008019	For [ even the whole ] creation ( all nature ) waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God’s sons to be made known [ waits for the revealing , the disclosing of their sonship ] .
45008020	For the creation ( nature ) was subjected to frailty ( to futility , condemned to frustration ) , not because of some intentional fault on its part , but by the will of Him Who so subjected it -- [ yet ] with the hope
45008021	That nature ( creation ) itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and corruption [ and gain an entrance ] into the glorious freedom of God’s children .
45008022	We know that the whole creation [ of irrational creatures ] has been moaning together in the pains of labor until now .
45008023	And not only the creation , but we ourselves too , who have and enjoy the firstfruits of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ a foretaste of the blissful things to come ] groan inwardly as we wait for the redemption of our bodies [ from sensuality and the grave , which will reveal ] our adoption ( our manifestation as God’s sons ) .
45008024	For in [ this ] hope we were saved . But hope [ the object of ] which is seen is not hope . For how can one hope for what he already sees ?
45008025	But if we hope for what is still unseen by us , we wait for it with patience and composure .
45008026	So too the [ Holy ] Spirit comes to our aid and bears us up in our weakness ; for we do not know what prayer to offer nor how to offer it worthily as we ought , but the Spirit Himself goes to meet our supplication and pleads in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings and groanings too deep for utterance .
45008027	And He Who searches the hearts of men knows what is in the mind of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ what His intent is ] , because the Spirit intercedes and pleads [ before God ] in behalf of the saints according to and in harmony with God’s will .
45008028	We are assured and know that [ God being a partner in their labor ] all things work together and are [ fitting into a plan ] for good to and for those who love God and are called according to [ His ] design and purpose .
45008029	For those whom He foreknew [ of whom He was aware and loved beforehand ] , He also destined from the beginning [ foreordaining them ] to be molded into the image of His Son [ and share inwardly His likeness ] , that He might become the firstborn among many brethren .
45008030	And those whom He thus foreordained , He also called ; and those whom He called , He also justified ( acquitted , made righteous , putting them into right standing with Himself ) . And those whom He justified , He also glorified [ raising them to a heavenly dignity and condition or state of being ] .
45008031	What then shall we say to [ all ] this ? If God is for us , who [ can be ] against us ? [ Who can be our foe , if God is on our side ? ]
45008032	He who did not withhold or spare [ even ] His own Son but gave Him up for us all , will He not also with Him freely and graciously give us all [ other ] things ?
45008033	Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect [ when it is ] God Who justifies [ that is , Who puts us in right relation to Himself ? Who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God has chosen ? Will God , Who acquits us ? ]
45008034	Who is there to condemn [ us ] ? Will Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , Who died , or rather Who was raised from the dead , Who is at the right hand of God actually pleading as He intercedes for us ?
45008035	Who shall ever separate us from Christ’s love ? Shall suffering and affliction and tribulation ? Or calamity and distress ? Or persecution or hunger or destitution or peril or sword ?
45008036	Even as it is written , For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long ; we are regarded and counted as sheep for the slaughter .
45008037	Yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors and gain a surpassing victory through Him Who loved us .
45008038	For I am persuaded beyond doubt ( am sure ) that neither death nor life , nor angels nor principalities , nor things impending and threatening nor things to come , nor powers ,
45008039	Nor height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I AM speaking the truth in Christ . I am not lying ; my conscience [ enlightened and prompted ] by the Holy Spirit bearing witness with me
45009002	That I have bitter grief and incessant anguish in my heart .
45009003	For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off and banished from Christ for the sake of my brethren and instead of them , my natural kinsmen and my fellow countrymen .
45009004	For they are Israelites , and to them belong God’s adoption [ as a nation ] and the glorious Presence ( Shekinah ) . With them were the special covenants made , to them was the Law given . To them [ the temple ] worship was revealed and [ God’s own ] promises announced .
45009005	To them belong the patriarchs , and as far as His natural descent was concerned , from them is the Christ , Who is exalted and supreme over all , God , blessed forever ! Amen ( so let it be ) .
45009006	However , it is not as though God’s Word had failed [ coming to nothing ] . For it is not everybody who is a descendant of Jacob ( Israel ) who belongs to [ the true ] Israel .
45009007	And they are not all the children of Abraham because they are by blood his descendants . No , [ the promise was ] Your descendants will be called and counted through the line of Isaac [ though Abraham had an older son ] .
45009008	That is to say , it is not the children of the body [ of Abraham ] who are made God’s children , but it is the offspring to whom the promise applies that shall be counted [ as Abraham’s true ] descendants .
45009009	For this is what the promise said , About this time [ next year ] will I return and Sarah shall have a son .
45009010	And not only that , but this too : Rebecca conceived [ two sons under exactly the same circumstances ] by our forefather Isaac ,
45009011	And the children were yet unborn and had so far done nothing either good or evil . Even so , in order further to carry out God’s purpose of selection ( election , choice ) , which depends not on works or what men can do , but on Him Who calls [ them ] ,
45009012	It was said to her that the elder [ son ] should serve the younger [ son ] .
45009013	As it is written , Jacob have I loved , but Esau have I hated ( held in relative disregard in comparison with My feeling for Jacob ) .
45009014	What shall we conclude then ? Is there injustice upon God’s part ? Certainly not !
45009015	For He says to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion ( pity ) on whom I will have compassion .
45009016	So then [ God’s gift ] is not a question of human will and human effort , but of God’s mercy . [ It depends not on one’s own willingness nor on his strenuous exertion as in running a race , but on God’s having mercy on him . ]
45009017	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , I have raised you up for this very purpose of displaying My power in [ dealing with ] you , so that My name may be proclaimed the whole world over .
45009018	So then He has mercy on whomever He wills ( chooses ) and He hardens ( makes stubborn and unyielding the heart of ) whomever He wills .
45009019	You will say to me , Why then does He still find fault and blame us [ for sinning ] ? For who can resist and withstand His will ?
45009020	But who are you , a mere man , to criticize and contradict and answer back to God ? Will what is formed say to him that formed it , Why have you made me thus ?
45009021	Has the potter no right over the clay , to make out of the same mass ( lump ) one vessel for beauty and distinction and honorable use , and another for menial or ignoble and dishonorable use ?
45009022	What if God , although fully intending to show [ the awfulness of ] His wrath and to make known His power and authority , has tolerated with much patience the vessels ( objects ) of [ His ] anger which are ripe for destruction ?
45009023	And [ what if ] He thus purposes to make known and show the wealth of His glory in [ dealing with ] the vessels ( objects ) of His mercy which He has prepared beforehand for glory ,
45009024	Even including ourselves whom He has called , not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles ( heathen ) ?
45009025	Just as He says in Hosea , Those who were not My people I will call My people , and her who was not beloved [ I will call ] My beloved .
45009026	And it shall be that in the very place where it was said to them , You are not My people , they shall be called sons of the living God .
45009027	And Isaiah calls out ( solemnly cries aloud ) over Israel : Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea , only the remnant ( a small part of them ) will be saved [ from perdition , condemnation , judgment ] !
45009028	For the Lord will execute His sentence upon the earth [ He will conclude and close His account with men completely and without delay ] , rigorously cutting it short in His justice .
45009029	It is as Isaiah predicted , If the Lord of hosts had not left us a seed [ from which to propagate descendants ] , we [ Israel ] would have fared like Sodom and have been made like Gomorrah .
45009030	What shall we say then ? That Gentiles who did not follow after righteousness [ who did not seek salvation by right relationship to God ] have attained it by faith [ a righteousness imputed by God , based on and produced by faith ] ,
45009031	Whereas Israel , though ever in pursuit of a law [ for the securing ] of righteousness ( right standing with God ) , actually did not succeed in fulfilling the Law .
45009032	For what reason ? Because [ they pursued it ] not through faith , relying [ instead ] on the merit of their works [ they did not depend on faith but on what they could do ] . They have stumbled over the Stumbling Stone .
45009033	As it is written , Behold I am laying in Zion a Stone that will make men stumble , a Rock that will make them fall ; but he who believes in Him [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] shall not be put to shame nor be disappointed in his expectations .
45010001	BRETHREN , [ with all ] my heart’s desire and goodwill for [ Israel ] , I long and pray to God that they may be saved .
45010002	I bear them witness that they have a [ certain ] zeal and enthusiasm for God , but it is not enlightened and according to [ correct and vital ] knowledge .
45010003	For being ignorant of the righteousness that God ascribes [ which makes one acceptable to Him in word , thought , and deed ] and seeking to establish a righteousness ( a means of salvation ) of their own , they did not obey or submit themselves to God’s righteousness .
45010004	For Christ is the end of the Law [ the limit at which it ceases to be , for the Law leads up to Him Who is the fulfillment of its types , and in Him the purpose which it was designed to accomplish is fulfilled . That is , the purpose of the Law is fulfilled in Him ] as the means of righteousness ( right relationship to God ) for everyone who trusts in and adheres to and relies on Him .
45010005	For Moses writes that the man who [ can ] practice the righteousness ( perfect conformity to God’s will ) which is based on the Law [ with all its intricate demands ] shall live by it .
45010006	But the righteousness based on faith [ imputed by God and bringing right relationship with Him ] says , Do not say in your heart , Who will ascend into Heaven ? that is , to bring Christ down ;
45010007	Or who will descend into the abyss ? that is , to bring Christ up from the dead [ as if we could be saved by our own efforts ] .
45010008	But what does it say ? The Word ( God’s message in Christ ) is near you , on your lips and in your heart ; that is , the Word ( the message , the basis and object ) of faith which we preach ,
45010009	Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe ( adhere to , trust in , and rely on the truth ) that God raised Him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	For with the heart a person believes ( adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Christ ) and so is justified ( declared righteous , acceptable to God ) , and with the mouth he confesses ( declares openly and speaks out freely his faith ) and confirms [ his ] salvation .
45010011	The Scripture says , No man who believes in Him [ who adheres to , relies on , and trusts in Him ] will [ ever ] be put to shame or be disappointed .
45010012	[ No one ] for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek . The same Lord is Lord over all [ of us ] and He generously bestows His riches upon all who call upon Him [ in faith ] .
45010013	For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord [ invoking Him as Lord ] will be saved .
45010014	But how are people to call upon Him Whom they have not believed [ in Whom they have no faith , on Whom they have no reliance ] ? And how are they to believe in Him [ adhere to , trust in , and rely upon Him ] of Whom they have never heard ? And how are they to hear without a preacher ?
45010015	And how can men [ be expected to ] preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings ! [ How welcome is the coming of those who preach the good news of His good things ! ]
45010016	But they have not all heeded the Gospel ; for Isaiah says , Lord , who has believed ( had faith in ) what he has heard from us ?
45010017	So faith comes by hearing [ what is told ] , and what is heard comes by the preaching [ of the message that came from the lips ] of Christ ( the Messiah Himself ) .
45010018	But I ask , Have they not heard ? Indeed they have ; [ for the Scripture says ] Their voice [ that of nature bearing God’s message ] has gone out to all the earth , and their words to the far bounds of the world .
45010019	Again I ask , Did Israel not understand ? [ Did the Jews have no warning that the Gospel was to go forth to the Gentiles , to all the earth ? ] First , there is Moses who says , I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation ; with a foolish nation I will make you angry .
45010020	Then Isaiah is so bold as to say , I have been found by those who did not seek Me ; I have shown ( revealed ) Myself to those who did not [ consciously ] ask for Me .
45010021	But of Israel he says , All day long I have stretched out My hands to a people unyielding and disobedient and self-willed [ to a faultfinding , contrary , and contradicting people ] .
45011001	I ASK then : Has God totally rejected and disowned His people ? Of course not ! Why , I myself am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , a member of the tribe of Benjamin !
45011002	No , God has not rejected and disowned His people [ whose destiny ] He had marked out and appointed and foreknown from the beginning . Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
45011003	Lord , they have killed Your prophets ; they have demolished Your altars , and I alone am left , and they seek my life .
45011004	But what is God’s reply to him ? I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal !
45011005	So too at the present time there is a remnant ( a small believing minority ) , selected ( chosen ) by grace ( by God’s unmerited favor and graciousness ) .
45011006	But if it is by grace ( His unmerited favor and graciousness ) , it is no longer conditioned on works or anything men have done . Otherwise , grace would no longer be grace [ it would be meaningless ] .
45011007	What then [ shall we conclude ] ? Israel failed to obtain what it sought [ God’s favor by obedience to the Law ] . Only the elect ( those chosen few ) obtained it , while the rest of them became callously indifferent ( blinded , hardened , and made insensible to it ) .
45011008	As it is written , God gave them a spirit ( an attitude ) of stupor , eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear , [ that has continued ] down to this very day .
45011009	And David says , Let their table ( their feasting , banqueting ) become a snare and a trap , a pitfall and a just retribution [ rebounding like a boomerang upon them ] ;
45011010	Let their eyes be darkened ( dimmed ) so that they cannot see , and make them bend their back [ stooping beneath their burden ] forever .
45011011	So I ask , Have they stumbled so as to fall [ to their utter spiritual ruin , irretrievably ] ? By no means ! But through their false step and transgression salvation [ has come ] to the Gentiles , so as to arouse Israel [ to see and feel what they forfeited ] and so to make them jealous .
45011012	Now if their stumbling ( their lapse , their transgression ) has so enriched the world [ at large ] , and if [ Israel’s ] failure means such riches for the Gentiles , think what an enrichment and greater advantage will follow their full reinstatement !
45011013	But now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I lay great stress on my ministry and magnify my office ,
45011014	In the hope of making my fellow Jews jealous [ in order to stir them up to imitate , copy , and appropriate ] , and thus managing to save some of them .
45011015	For if their rejection and exclusion from the benefits of salvation were [ overruled ] for the reconciliation of a world to God , what will their acceptance and admission mean ? [ It will be nothing short of ] life from the dead !
45011016	Now if the first handful of dough offered as the firstfruits [ Abraham and the patriarchs ] is consecrated ( holy ) , so is the whole mass [ the nation of Israel ] ; and if the root [ Abraham ] is consecrated ( holy ) , so are the branches .
45011017	But if some of the branches were broken off , while you , a wild olive shoot , were grafted in among them to share the richness [ of the root and sap ] of the olive tree ,
45011018	Do not boast over the branches and pride yourself at their expense . If you do boast and feel superior , remember it is not you that support the root , but the root [ that supports ] you .
45011019	You will say then , Branches were broken ( pruned ) off so that I might be grafted in !
45011020	That is true . But they were broken ( pruned ) off because of their unbelief ( their lack of real faith ) , and you are established through faith [ because you do believe ] . So do not become proud and conceited , but rather stand in awe and be reverently afraid .
45011021	For if God did not spare the natural branches [ because of unbelief ] , neither will He spare you [ if you are guilty of the same offense ] .
45011022	Then note and appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God : severity toward those who have fallen , but God’s gracious kindness to you -- provided you continue in His grace and abide in His kindness ; otherwise you too will be cut off ( pruned away ) .
45011023	And even those others [ the fallen branches , Jews ] , if they do not persist in [ clinging to ] their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God has the power to graft them in again .
45011024	For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and against nature grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much easier will it be to graft these natural [ branches ] back on [ the original parent stock of ] their own olive tree .
45011025	Lest you be self-opinionated ( wise in your own conceits ) , I do not want you to miss this hidden truth and mystery , brethren : a hardening ( insensibility ) has [ temporarily ] befallen a part of Israel [ to last ] until the full number of the ingathering of the Gentiles has come in ,
45011026	And so all Israel will be saved . As it is written , The Deliverer will come from Zion , He will banish ungodliness from Jacob .
45011027	And this will be My covenant ( My agreement ) with them when I shall take away their sins .
45011028	From the point of view of the Gospel ( good news ) , they [ the Jews , at present ] are enemies [ of God ] , which is for your advantage and benefit . But from the point of view of God’s choice ( of election , of divine selection ) , they are still the beloved ( dear to Him ) for the sake of their forefathers .
45011029	For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable . [ He never withdraws them when once they are given , and He does not change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call . ]
45011030	Just as you were once disobedient and rebellious toward God but now have obtained [ His ] mercy , through their disobedience ,
45011031	So they also now are being disobedient [ when you are receiving mercy ] , that they in turn may one day , through the mercy you are enjoying , also receive mercy [ that they may share the mercy which has been shown to you -- through you as messengers of the Gospel to them ] .
45011032	For God has consigned ( penned up ) all men to disobedience , only that He may have mercy on them all [ alike ] .
45011033	Oh , the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unfathomable ( inscrutable , unsearchable ) are His judgments ( His decisions ) ! And how untraceable ( mysterious , undiscoverable ) are His ways ( His methods , His paths ) !
45011034	For who has known the mind of the Lord and who has understood His thoughts , or who has [ ever ] been His counselor ?
45011035	Or who has first given God anything that he might be paid back or that he could claim a recompense ?
45011036	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things . [ For all things originate with Him and come from Him ; all things live through Him , and all things center in and tend to consummate and to end in Him . ] To Him be glory forever ! Amen ( so be it ) .
45012001	I APPEAL to you therefore , brethren , and beg of you in view of [ all ] the mercies of God , to make a decisive dedication of your bodies [ presenting all your members and faculties ] as a living sacrifice , holy ( devoted , consecrated ) and well pleasing to God , which is your reasonable ( rational , intelligent ) service and spiritual worship .
45012002	Do not be conformed to this world ( this age ) , [ fashioned after and adapted to its external , superficial customs ] , but be transformed ( changed ) by the [ entire ] renewal of your mind [ by its new ideals and its new attitude ] , so that you may prove [ for yourselves ] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God , even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect [ in His sight for you ] .
45012003	For by the grace ( unmerited favor of God ) given to me I warn everyone among you not to estimate and think of himself more highly than he ought [ not to have an exaggerated opinion of his own importance ] , but to rate his ability with sober judgment , each according to the degree of faith apportioned by God to him .
45012004	For as in one physical body we have many parts ( organs , members ) and all of these parts do not have the same function or use ,
45012005	So we , numerous as we are , are one body in Christ ( the Messiah ) and individually we are parts one of another [ mutually dependent on one another ] .
45012006	Having gifts ( faculties , talents , qualities ) that differ according to the grace given us , let us use them : [ He whose gift is ] prophecy , [ let him prophesy ] according to the proportion of his faith ;
45012007	[ He whose gift is ] practical service , let him give himself to serving ; he who teaches , to his teaching ;
45012008	He who exhorts ( encourages ) , to his exhortation ; he who contributes , let him do it in simplicity and liberality ; he who gives aid and superintends , with zeal and singleness of mind ; he who does acts of mercy , with genuine cheerfulness and joyful eagerness .
45012009	[ Let your ] love be sincere ( a real thing ) ; hate what is evil [ loathe all ungodliness , turn in horror from wickedness ] , but hold fast to that which is good .
45012010	Love one another with brotherly affection [ as members of one family ] , giving precedence and showing honor to one another .
45012011	Never lag in zeal and in earnest endeavor ; be aglow and burning with the Spirit , serving the Lord .
45012012	Rejoice and exult in hope ; be steadfast and patient in suffering and tribulation ; be constant in prayer .
45012013	Contribute to the needs of God’s people [ sharing in the necessities of the saints ] ; pursue the practice of hospitality .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you [ who are cruel in their attitude toward you ] ; bless and do not curse them .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice [ sharing others’ joy ] , and weep with those who weep [ sharing others’ grief ] .
45012016	Live in harmony with one another ; do not be haughty ( snobbish , high-minded , exclusive ) , but readily adjust yourself to [ people , things ] and give yourselves to humble tasks . Never overestimate yourself or be wise in your own conceits .
45012017	Repay no one evil for evil , but take thought for what is honest and proper and noble [ aiming to be above reproach ] in the sight of everyone .
45012018	If possible , as far as it depends on you , live at peace with everyone .
45012019	Beloved , never avenge yourselves , but leave the way open for [ God’s ] wrath ; for it is written , Vengeance is Mine , I will repay ( requite ) , says the Lord .
45012020	But if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him drink ; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head .
45012021	Do not let yourself be overcome by evil , but overcome ( master ) evil with good .
45013001	LET EVERY person be loyally subject to the governing ( civil ) authorities . For there is no authority except from God [ by His permission , His sanction ] , and those that exist do so by God’s appointment .
45013002	Therefore he who resists and sets himself up against the authorities resists what God has appointed and arranged [ in divine order ] . And those who resist will bring down judgment upon themselves [ receiving the penalty due them ] .
45013003	For civil authorities are not a terror to [ people of ] good conduct , but to [ those of ] bad behavior . Would you have no dread of him who is in authority ? Then do what is right and you will receive his approval and commendation .
45013004	For he is God’s servant for your good . But if you do wrong , [ you should dread him and ] be afraid , for he does not bear and wear the sword for nothing . He is God’s servant to execute His wrath ( punishment , vengeance ) on the wrongdoer .
45013005	Therefore one must be subject , not only to avoid God’s wrath and escape punishment , but also as a matter of principle and for the sake of conscience .
45013006	For this same reason you pay taxes , for [ the civil authorities ] are official servants under God , devoting themselves to attending to this very service .
45013007	Render to all men their dues . [ Pay ] taxes to whom taxes are due , revenue to whom revenue is due , respect to whom respect is due , and honor to whom honor is due .
45013008	Keep out of debt and owe no man anything , except to love one another ; for he who loves his neighbor [ who practices loving others ] has fulfilled the Law [ relating to one’s fellowmen , meeting all its requirements ] .
45013009	The commandments , You shall not commit adultery , You shall not kill , You shall not steal , You shall not covet ( have an evil desire ) , and any other commandment , are summed up in the single command , You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself .
45013010	Love does no wrong to one’s neighbor [ it never hurts anybody ] . Therefore love meets all the requirements and is the fulfilling of the Law .
45013011	Besides this you know what [ a critical ] hour this is , how it is high time now for you to wake up out of your sleep ( rouse to reality ) . For salvation ( final deliverance ) is nearer to us now than when we first believed ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Christ , the Messiah ) .
45013012	The night is far gone and the day is almost here . Let us then drop ( fling away ) the works and deeds of darkness and put on the [ full ] armor of light .
45013013	Let us live and conduct ourselves honorably and becomingly as in the [ open light of ] day , not in reveling ( carousing ) and drunkenness , not in immorality and debauchery ( sensuality and licentiousness ) , not in quarreling and jealousy .
45013014	But clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , and make no provision for [ indulging ] the flesh [ put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature ] to [ gratify its ] desires ( lusts ) .
45014001	AS FOR the man who is a weak believer , welcome him [ into your fellowship ] , but not to criticize his opinions or pass judgment on his scruples or perplex him with discussions .
45014002	One [ man’s faith permits him to ] believe he may eat anything , while a weaker one [ limits his ] eating to vegetables .
45014003	Let not him who eats look down on or despise him who abstains , and let not him who abstains criticize and pass judgment on him who eats ; for God has accepted and welcomed him .
45014004	Who are you to pass judgment on and censure another’s household servant ? It is before his own master that he stands or falls . And he shall stand and be upheld , for the Master ( the Lord ) is mighty to support him and make him stand .
45014005	One man esteems one day as better than another , while another man esteems all days alike [ sacred ] . Let everyone be fully convinced ( satisfied ) in his own mind .
45014006	He who observes the day , observes it in honor of the Lord . He also who eats , eats in honor of the Lord , since he gives thanks to God ; while he who abstains , abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God .
45014007	None of us lives to himself [ but to the Lord ] , and none of us dies to himself [ but to the Lord , for ]
45014008	If we live , we live to the Lord , and if we die , we die to the Lord . So then , whether we live or we die , we belong to the Lord .
45014009	For Christ died and lived again for this very purpose , that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living .
45014010	Why do you criticize and pass judgment on your brother ? Or you , why do you look down upon or despise your brother ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God .
45014011	For it is written , As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow to Me , and every tongue shall confess to God [ acknowledge Him to His honor and to His praise ] .
45014012	And so each of us shall give an account of himself [ give an answer in reference to judgment ] to God .
45014013	Then let us no more criticize and blame and pass judgment on one another , but rather decide and endeavor never to put a stumbling block or an obstacle or a hindrance in the way of a brother .
45014014	I know and am convinced ( persuaded ) as one in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is [ forbidden as ] essentially unclean ( defiled and unholy in itself ) . But [ none the less ] it is unclean ( defiled and unholy ) to anyone who thinks it is unclean .
45014015	But if your brother is being pained or his feelings hurt or if he is being injured by what you eat , [ then ] you are no longer walking in love . [ You have ceased to be living and conducting yourself by the standard of love toward him . ] Do not let what you eat hurt or cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died !
45014016	Do not therefore let what seems good to you be considered an evil thing [ by someone else ] . [ In other words , do not give occasion for others to criticize that which is justifiable for you . ]
45014017	[ After all ] the kingdom of God is not a matter of [ getting the ] food and drink [ one likes ] , but instead it is righteousness ( that state which makes a person acceptable to God ) and [ heart ] peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	He who serves Christ in this way is acceptable and pleasing to God and is approved by men .
45014019	So let us then definitely aim for and eagerly pursue what makes for harmony and for mutual upbuilding ( edification and development ) of one another .
45014020	You must not , for the sake of food , undo and break down and destroy the work of God ! Everything is indeed [ ceremonially ] clean and pure , but it is wrong for anyone to hurt the conscience of others or to make them fall by what he eats .
45014021	The right thing is to eat no meat or drink no wine [ at all ] , or [ do anything else ] if it makes your brother stumble or hurts his conscience or offends or weakens him .
45014022	Your personal convictions [ on such matters ] -- exercise [ them ] as in God’s presence , keeping them to yourself [ striving only to know the truth and obey His will ] . Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) is he who has no reason to judge himself for what he approves [ who does not convict himself by what he chooses to do ] .
45014023	But the man who has doubts ( misgivings , an uneasy conscience ) about eating , and then eats [ perhaps because of you ] , stands condemned [ before God ] , because he is not true to his convictions and he does not act from faith . For whatever does not originate and proceed from faith is sin [ whatever is done without a conviction of its approval by God is sinful ] .
45015001	WE WHO are strong [ in our convictions and of robust faith ] ought to bear with the failings and the frailties and the tender scruples of the weak ; [ we ought to help carry the doubts and qualms of others ] and not to please ourselves .
45015002	Let each one of us make it a practice to please ( make happy ) his neighbor for his good and for his true welfare , to edify him [ to strengthen him and build him up spiritually ] .
45015003	For Christ did not please Himself [ gave no thought to His own interests ] ; but , as it is written , The reproaches and abuses of those who reproached and abused you fell on Me .
45015004	For whatever was thus written in former days was written for our instruction , that by [ our steadfast and patient ] endurance and the encouragement [ drawn ] from the Scriptures we might hold fast to and cherish hope .
45015005	Now may the God Who gives the power of patient endurance ( steadfastness ) and Who supplies encouragement , grant you to live in such mutual harmony and such full sympathy with one another , in accord with Christ Jesus ,
45015006	That together you may [ unanimously ] with united hearts and one voice , praise and glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
45015007	Welcome and receive [ to your hearts ] one another , then , even as Christ has welcomed and received you , for the glory of God .
45015008	For I tell you that Christ ( the Messiah ) became a servant and a minister to the circumcised ( the Jews ) in order to show God’s truthfulness and honesty by confirming ( verifying ) the promises [ given ] to our fathers ,
45015009	And [ also in order ] that the Gentiles ( nations ) might glorify God for His mercy [ not covenanted ] to them . As it is written , Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles and sing praises to Your name .
45015010	Again it is said , Rejoice ( exult ) , O Gentiles , along with His [ own ] people ;
45015011	And again , Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and let all the peoples praise Him !
45015012	And further Isaiah says , There shall be a Sprout from the Root of Jesse , He Who rises to rule over the Gentiles ; in Him shall the Gentiles hope .
45015013	May the God of your hope so fill you with all joy and peace in believing [ through the experience of your faith ] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound and be overflowing ( bubbling over ) with hope .
45015014	Personally I am satisfied about you , my brethren , that you yourselves are rich in goodness , amply filled with all [ spiritual ] knowledge and competent to admonish and counsel and instruct one another also .
45015015	Still on some points I have written to you the more boldly and unreservedly by way of reminder . [ I have done so ] because of the grace ( the unmerited favor ) bestowed on me by God
45015016	In making me a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . I act in the priestly service of the Gospel ( the good news ) of God , in order that the sacrificial offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable [ to God ] , consecrated and made holy by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	In Christ Jesus , then , I have legitimate reason to glory ( exult ) in my work for God [ in what through Christ Jesus I have accomplished concerning the things of God ] .
45015018	For [ of course ] I will not venture ( presume ) to speak thus of any work except what Christ has actually done through me [ as an instrument in His hands ] to win obedience from the Gentiles , by word and deed ,
45015019	[ Even as my preaching has been accompanied ] with the power of signs and wonders , [ and all of it ] by the power of the Holy Spirit . [ The result is ] that starting from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum , I have fully preached the Gospel [ faithfully executing , accomplishing , carrying out to the full the good news ] of Christ ( the Messiah ) in its entirety .
45015020	Thus my ambition has been to preach the Gospel , not where Christ’s name has already been known , lest I build on another man’s foundation ;
45015021	But [ instead I would act on the principle ] as it is written , They shall see who have never been told of Him , and they shall understand who have never heard [ of Him ] .
45015022	This [ ambition ] is the reason why I have so frequently been hindered from coming to visit you .
45015023	But now since I have no further opportunity for work in these regions , and since I have longed for enough years to come to you ,
45015024	I hope to see you in passing [ through Rome ] as I go [ on my intended trip ] to Spain , and to be aided on my journey there by you , after I have enjoyed your company for a little while .
45015025	For the present , however , I am going to Jerusalem to bring aid ( relief ) for the saints ( God’s people there ) .
45015026	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the saints of Jerusalem .
45015027	They were pleased to do it ; and surely they are in debt to them , for if these Gentiles have come to share in their [ the Jerusalem Jews’ ] spiritual blessings , then they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings .
45015028	When therefore I have completed this mission and have delivered to them [ at Jerusalem ] what has been raised , I shall go on by way of you to Spain .
45015029	And I know that when I do come to you , I shall come in the abundant blessing of the Gospel of Christ .
45015030	I appeal to you [ I entreat you ] , brethren , for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love [ given by ] the Spirit , to unite with me in earnest wrestling in prayer to God in my behalf .
45015031	[ Pray ] that I may be delivered ( rescued ) from the unbelievers in Judea and that my mission of relief to Jerusalem may be acceptable and graciously received by the saints ( God’s people there ) ,
45015032	So that by God’s will I may subsequently come to you with joy ( with a happy heart ) and be refreshed [ by the interval of rest ] in your company .
45015033	May [ our ] peace-giving God be with you all ! Amen ( so be it ) .
45016001	NOW I introduce and commend to you our sister Phoebe , a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae ,
45016002	That you may receive her in the Lord [ with a Christian welcome ] , as saints ( God’s people ) ought to receive one another . And help her in whatever matter she may require assistance from you , for she has been a helper of many including myself [ shielding us from suffering ] .
45016003	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	Who risked their lives [ endangering their very necks ] for my life . To them not only I but also all the churches among the Gentiles give thanks .
45016005	[ Remember me ] also to the church [ that meets ] in their house . Greet my beloved Epaenetus , who was a firstfruit ( first convert ) to Christ in Asia .
45016006	Greet Mary , who has worked so hard among you .
45016007	Remember me to Andronicus and Junias , my tribal kinsmen and once my fellow prisoners . They are men held in high esteem among the apostles , who also were in Christ before I was .
45016008	Remember me to Ampliatus , my beloved in the Lord .
45016009	Salute Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and my dear Stachys .
45016010	Greet Apelles , that one tried and approved in Christ ( the Messiah ) . Remember me to those who belong to the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet my tribal kinsman Herodion , and those in the Lord who belong to the household of Narcissus .
45016012	Salute those workers in the Lord , Tryphaena and Tryphosa . Greet my dear Persis , who has worked so hard in the Lord .
45016013	Remember me to Rufus , eminent in the Lord , also to his mother [ who has been ] a mother to me as well .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brethren who are with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy ( consecrated ) kiss . All the churches of Christ ( the Messiah ) wish to be remembered to you .
45016017	I appeal to you , brethren , to be on your guard concerning those who create dissensions and difficulties and cause divisions , in opposition to the doctrine ( the teaching ) which you have been taught . [ I warn you to turn aside from them , to ] avoid them .
45016018	For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites and base desires , and by ingratiating and flattering speech , they beguile the hearts of the unsuspecting and simpleminded [ people ] .
45016019	For while your loyalty and obedience is known to all , so that I rejoice over you , I would have you well versed and wise as to what is good and innocent and guileless as to what is evil .
45016020	And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my fellow worker , wishes to be remembered to you , as do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my tribal kinsmen .
45016022	I , Tertius , the writer of this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , who is host to me and to the whole church here , greets you . So do Erastus , the city treasurer , and our brother Quartus .
45016024	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) .
45016025	Now to Him Who is able to strengthen you in the faith which is in accordance with my Gospel and the preaching of ( concerning ) Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , according to the revelation ( the unveiling ) of the mystery of the plan of redemption which was kept in silence and secret for long ages ,
45016026	But is now disclosed and through the prophetic Scriptures is made known to all nations , according to the command of the eternal God , [ to win them ] to obedience to the faith ,
45016027	To [ the ] only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) ! Amen ( so be it ) .
46001001	PAUL , SUMMONED by the will and purpose of God to be an apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus , and our brother Sosthenes ,
46001002	To the church ( assembly ) of God which is in Corinth , to those consecrated and purified and made holy in Christ Jesus , [ who are ] selected and called to be saints ( God’s people ) , together with all those who in any place call upon and give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , both their Lord and ours :
46001003	Grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) be to you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I thank my God at all times for you because of the grace ( the favor and spiritual blessing ) of God which was bestowed on you in Christ Jesus ,
46001005	[ So ] that in Him in every respect you were enriched , in full power and readiness of speech [ to speak of your faith ] and complete knowledge and illumination [ to give you full insight into its meaning ] .
46001006	In this way [ our ] witnessing concerning Christ ( the Messiah ) was so confirmed and established and made sure in you
46001007	That you are not [ consciously ] falling behind or lacking in any special spiritual endowment or Christian grace [ the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit ] , while you wait and watch [ constantly living in hope ] for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and [ His ] being made visible to all .
46001008	And He will establish you to the end [ keep you steadfast , give you strength , and guarantee your vindication ; He will be your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be ] guiltless and irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
46001009	God is faithful ( reliable , trustworthy , and therefore ever true to His promise , and He can be depended on ) ; by Him you were called into companionship and participation with His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	But I urge and entreat you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you be in perfect harmony and full agreement in what you say , and that there be no dissensions or factions or divisions among you , but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding and in your opinions and judgments .
46001011	For it has been made clear to me , my brethren , by those of Chloe’s household , that there are contentions and wrangling and factions among you .
46001012	What I mean is this , that each one of you [ either ] says , I belong to Paul , or I belong to Apollos , or I belong to Cephas ( Peter ) , or I belong to Christ .
46001013	Is Christ ( the Messiah ) divided into parts ? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you ? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul ?
46001014	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name .
46001016	[ Yes ] I did baptize the household of Stephanas also . More than these , I do not remember that I baptized anyone .
46001017	For Christ ( the Messiah ) sent me out not to baptize but [ to evangelize by ] preaching the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) , and that not with verbal eloquence , lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force and emptied of its power and rendered vain ( fruitless , void of value , and of no effect ) .
46001018	For the story and message of the cross is sheer absurdity and folly to those who are perishing and on their way to perdition , but to us who are being saved it is the [ manifestation of ] the power of God .
46001019	For it is written , I will baffle and render useless and destroy the learning of the learned and the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever and the discernment of the discerning ; I will frustrate and nullify [ them ] and bring [ them ] to nothing .
46001020	Where is the wise man ( the philosopher ) ? Where is the scribe ( the scholar ) ? Where is the investigator ( the logician , the debater ) of this present time and age ? Has not God shown up the nonsense and the folly of this world’s wisdom ?
46001021	For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive and recognize and know God by means of its own philosophy , God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching [ salvation , procured by Christ and to be had through Him ] , to save those who believed ( who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him ) .
46001022	For while Jews [ demandingly ] ask for signs and miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy and wisdom ,
46001023	We preach Christ ( the Messiah ) crucified , [ preaching which ] to the Jews is a scandal and an offensive stumbling block [ that springs a snare or trap ] , and to the Gentiles it is absurd and utterly unphilosophical nonsense .
46001024	But to those who are called , whether Jew or Greek ( Gentile ) , Christ [ is ] the Power of God and the Wisdom of God .
46001025	[ This is ] because the foolish thing [ that has its source in ] God is wiser than men , and the weak thing [ that springs ] from God is stronger than men .
46001026	For [ simply ] consider your own call , brethren ; not many [ of you were considered to be ] wise according to human estimates and standards , not many influential and powerful , not many of high and noble birth .
46001027	[ No ] for God selected ( deliberately chose ) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame , and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame .
46001028	And God also selected ( deliberately chose ) what in the world is lowborn and insignificant and branded and treated with contempt , even the things that are nothing , that He might depose and bring to nothing the things that are ,
46001029	So that no mortal man should [ have pretense for glorying and ] boast in the presence of God .
46001030	But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus , Whom God made our Wisdom from God , [ revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden , manifesting itself as ] our Righteousness [ thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God ] , and our Consecration [ making us pure and holy ] , and our Redemption [ providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin ] .
46001031	So then , as it is written , Let him who boasts and proudly rejoices and glories , boast and proudly rejoice and glory in the Lord .
46002001	AS FOR myself , brethren , when I came to you , I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony and evidence or mystery and secret of God [ concerning what He has done through Christ for the salvation of men ] in lofty words of eloquence or human philosophy and wisdom ;
46002002	For I resolved to know nothing ( to be acquainted with nothing , to make a display of the knowledge of nothing , and to be conscious of nothing ) among you except Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and Him crucified .
46002003	And I was in ( passed into a state of ) weakness and fear ( dread ) and great trembling [ after I had come ] among you .
46002004	And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive ( enticing and plausible ) words of wisdom , but they were in demonstration of the [ Holy ] Spirit and power [ a proof by the Spirit and power of God , operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them ] ,
46002005	So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men ( human philosophy ) , but in the power of God .
46002006	Yet when we are among the full-grown ( spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding ) , we do impart a [ higher ] wisdom ( the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden ) ; but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age or of this world nor of the leaders and rulers of this age , who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away .
46002007	But rather what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hidden [ from the human understanding ] and now revealed to us by God -- [ that wisdom ] which God devised and decreed before the ages for our glorification [ to lift us into the glory of His presence ] .
46002008	None of the rulers of this age or world perceived and recognized and understood this , for if they had , they would never have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	But , on the contrary , as the Scripture says , What eye has not seen and ear has not heard and has not entered into the heart of man , [ all that ] God has prepared ( made and keeps ready ) for those who love Him [ who hold Him in affectionate reverence , promptly obeying Him and gratefully recognizing the benefits He has bestowed ] .
46002010	Yet to us God has unveiled and revealed them by and through His Spirit , for the [ Holy ] Spirit searches diligently , exploring and examining everything , even sounding the profound and bottomless things of God [ the divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man’s scrutiny ] .
46002011	For what person perceives ( knows and understands ) what passes through a man’s thoughts except the man’s own spirit within him ? Just so no one discerns ( comes to know and comprehend ) the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
46002012	Now we have not received the spirit [ that belongs to ] the world , but the [ Holy ] Spirit Who is from God , [ given to us ] that we might realize and comprehend and appreciate the gifts [ of divine favor and blessing so freely and lavishly ] bestowed on us by God .
46002013	And we are setting these truths forth in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the [ Holy ] Spirit , combining and interpreting spiritual truths with spiritual language [ to those who possess the Holy Spirit ] .
46002014	But the natural , nonspiritual man does not accept or welcome or admit into his heart the gifts and teachings and revelations of the Spirit of God , for they are folly ( meaningless nonsense ) to him ; and he is incapable of knowing them [ of progressively recognizing , understanding , and becoming better acquainted with them ] because they are spiritually discerned and estimated and appreciated .
46002015	But the spiritual man tries all things [ he examines , investigates , inquires into , questions , and discerns all things ] , yet is himself to be put on trial and judged by no one [ he can read the meaning of everything , but no one can properly discern or appraise or get an insight into him ] .
46002016	For who has known or understood the mind ( the counsels and purposes ) of the Lord so as to guide and instruct Him and give Him knowledge ? But we have the mind of Christ ( the Messiah ) and do hold the thoughts ( feelings and purposes ) of His heart .
46003001	HOWEVER , BRETHREN , I could not talk to you as to spiritual [ men ] , but as to nonspiritual [ men of the flesh , in whom the carnal nature predominates ] , as to mere infants [ in the new life ] in Christ [ unable to talk yet ! ]
46003002	I fed you with milk , not solid food , for you were not yet strong enough [ to be ready for it ] ; but even yet you are not strong enough [ to be ready for it ] ,
46003003	For you are still [ unspiritual , having the nature ] of the flesh [ under the control of ordinary impulses ] . For as long as [ there are ] envying and jealousy and wrangling and factions among you , are you not unspiritual and of the flesh , behaving yourselves after a human standard and like mere ( unchanged ) men ?
46003004	For when one says , I belong to Paul , and another , I belong to Apollos , are you not [ proving yourselves ] ordinary ( unchanged ) men ?
46003005	What then is Apollos ? What is Paul ? Ministering servants [ not heads of parties ] through whom you believed , even as the Lord appointed to each his task :
46003006	I planted , Apollos watered , but God [ all the while ] was making it grow and [ He ] gave the increase .
46003007	So neither he who plants is anything nor he who waters , but [ only ] God Who makes it grow and become greater .
46003008	He who plants and he who waters are equal ( one in aim , of the same importance and esteem ) , yet each shall receive his own reward ( wages ) , according to his own labor .
46003009	For we are fellow workmen ( joint promoters , laborers together ) with and for God ; you are God’s garden and vineyard and field under cultivation , [ you are ] God’s building .
46003010	According to the grace ( the special endowment for my task ) of God bestowed on me , like a skillful architect and master builder I laid [ the ] foundation , and now another [ man ] is building upon it . But let each [ man ] be careful how he builds upon it ,
46003011	For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is [ already ] laid , which is Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
46003012	But if anyone builds upon the Foundation , whether it be with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
46003013	The work of each [ one ] will become [ plainly , openly ] known ( shown for what it is ) ; for the day [ of Christ ] will disclose and declare it , because it will be revealed with fire , and the fire will test and critically appraise the character and worth of the work each person has done .
46003014	If the work which any person has built on this Foundation [ any product of his efforts whatever ] survives [ this test ] , he will get his reward .
46003015	But if any person’s work is burned up [ under the test ] , he will suffer the loss [ of it all , losing his reward ] , though he himself will be saved , but only as [ one who has passed ] through fire .
46003016	Do you not discern and understand that you [ the whole church at Corinth ] are God’s temple ( His sanctuary ) , and that God’s Spirit has His permanent dwelling in you [ to be at home in you , collectively as a church and also individually ] ?
46003017	If anyone does hurt to God’s temple or corrupts it [ with false doctrines ] or destroys it , God will do hurt to him and bring him to the corruption of death and destroy him . For the temple of God is holy ( sacred to Him ) and that [ temple ] you [ the believing church and its individual believers ] are .
46003018	Let no person deceive himself . If anyone among you supposes that he is wise in this age , let him become a fool [ let him discard his worldly discernment and recognize himself as dull , stupid , and foolish , without true learning and scholarship ] , that he may become [ really ] wise .
46003019	For this world’s wisdom is foolishness ( absurdity and stupidity ) with God , for it is written , He lays hold of the wise in their [ own ] craftiness ;
46003020	And again , The Lord knows the thoughts and reasonings of the [ humanly ] wise and recognizes how futile they are .
46003021	So let no one exult proudly concerning men [ boasting of having this or that man as a leader ] , for all things are yours ,
46003022	Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas ( Peter ) , or the universe or life or death , or the immediate and threatening present or the [ subsequent and uncertain ] future -- all are yours ,
46003023	And you are Christ’s , and Christ is God’s .
46004001	SO THEN , let us [ apostles ] be looked upon as ministering servants of Christ and stewards ( trustees ) of the mysteries ( the secret purposes ) of God .
46004002	Moreover , it is [ essentially ] required of stewards that a man should be found faithful [ proving himself worthy of trust ] .
46004003	But [ as for me personally ] it matters very little to me that I should be put on trial by you [ on this point ] , and that you or any other human tribunal should investigate and question and cross-question me . I do not even put myself on trial and judge myself .
46004004	I am not conscious of anything against myself , and I feel blameless ; but I am not vindicated and acquitted before God on that account . It is the Lord [ Himself ] Who examines and judges me .
46004005	So do not make any hasty or premature judgments before the time when the Lord comes [ again ] , for He will both bring to light the secret things that are [ now hidden ] in darkness and disclose and expose the [ secret ] aims ( motives and purposes ) of hearts . Then every man will receive his [ due ] commendation from God .
46004006	Now I have applied all this [ about parties and factions ] to myself and Apollos for your sakes , brethren , so that from what I have said of us [ as illustrations ] , you may learn [ to think of men in accordance with Scripture and ] not to go beyond that which is written , that none of you may be puffed up and inflated with pride and boast in favor of one [ minister and teacher ] against another .
46004007	For who separates you from the others [ as a faction leader ] ? [ Who makes you superior and sets you apart from another , giving you the preeminence ? ] What have you that was not given to you ? If then you received it [ from someone ] , why do you boast as if you had not received [ but had gained it by your own efforts ] ?
46004008	[ You behave as if ] you are already filled and think you have enough [ you are full and content , feeling no need of anything more ] ! Already you have become rich [ in spiritual gifts and graces ] ! [ Without any counsel or instruction from us , in your conceit ] , you have ascended your thrones and come into your kingdom without including us ! And would that it were true and that you did reign , so that we might be sharing the kingdom with you !
46004009	For it seems to me that God has made an exhibit of us apostles , exposing us to view last [ of all , like men in a triumphal procession who are ] sentenced to death [ and displayed at the end of the line ] . For we have become a spectacle to the world [ a show in the world’s amphitheater ] with both men and angels [ as spectators ] .
46004010	We are [ looked upon as ] fools on account of Christ and for His sake , but you are [ supposedly ] so amazingly wise and prudent in Christ ! We are weak , but you are [ so very ] strong ! You are highly esteemed , but we are in disrepute and contempt !
46004011	To this hour we have gone both hungry and thirsty ; we [ habitually ] wear but one undergarment [ and shiver in the cold ] ; we are roughly knocked about and wander around homeless .
46004012	And we still toil unto weariness [ for our living ] , working hard with our own hands . When men revile us [ wound us with an accursed sting ] , we bless them . When we are persecuted , we take it patiently and endure it .
46004013	When we are slandered and defamed , we [ try to ] answer softly and bring comfort . We have been made and are now the rubbish and filth of the world [ the offscouring of all things , the scum of the earth ] .
46004014	I do not write this to shame you , but to warn and counsel you as my beloved children .
46004015	After all , though you should have ten thousand teachers ( guides to direct you ) in Christ , yet you do not have many fathers . For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) .
46004016	So I urge and implore you , be imitators of me .
46004017	For this very cause I sent to you Timothy , who is my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord , who will recall to your minds my methods of proceeding and course of conduct and way of life in Christ , such as I teach everywhere in each of the churches .
46004018	Some of you have become conceited and arrogant and pretentious , counting on my not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you [ and ] shortly , if the Lord is willing , and then I will perceive and understand not what the talk of these puffed up and arrogant spirits amount to , but their force ( the moral power and excellence of soul they really possess ) .
46004020	For the kingdom of God consists of and is based on not talk but power ( moral power and excellence of soul ) .
46004021	Now which do you prefer ? Shall I come to you with a rod of correction , or with love and in a spirit of gentleness ?
46005001	IT IS actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , impurity of a sort that is condemned and does not occur even among the heathen ; for a man has [ his own ] father’s wife .
46005002	And you are proud and arrogant ! And you ought rather to mourn ( bow in sorrow and in shame ) until the person who has done this [ shameful ] thing is removed from your fellowship and your midst !
46005003	As for my attitude , though I am absent [ from you ] in body , I am present in spirit , and I have already decided and passed judgment , as if actually present ,
46005004	In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , on the man who has committed such a deed . When you and my own spirit are met together with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	You are to deliver this man over to Satan for physical discipline [ to destroy carnal lusts which prompted him to incest ] , that [ his ] spirit may [ yet ] be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
46005006	[ About the condition of your church ] your boasting is not good [ indeed , it is most unseemly and entirely out of place ] . Do you not know that [ just ] a little leaven will ferment the whole lump [ of dough ] ?
46005007	Purge ( clean out ) the old leaven that you may be fresh ( new ) dough , still uncontaminated [ as you are ] , for Christ , our Passover [ Lamb ] , has been sacrificed .
46005008	Therefore , let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , nor with leaven of vice and malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened [ bread ] of purity ( nobility , honor ) and sincerity and [ unadulterated ] truth .
46005009	I wrote you in my [ previous ] letter not to associate [ closely and habitually ] with unchaste ( impure ) people --
46005010	Not [ meaning of course that you must ] altogether shun the immoral people of this world , or the greedy graspers and cheats and thieves or idolaters , since otherwise you would need to get out of the world and human society altogether !
46005011	But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of [ Christian ] brother if he is known to be guilty of immorality or greed , or is an idolater [ whose soul is devoted to any object that usurps the place of God ] , or is a person with a foul tongue [ railing , abusing , reviling , slandering ] , or is a drunkard or a swindler or a robber . [ No ] you must not so much as eat with such a person .
46005012	What [ business ] of mine is it and what right have I to judge outsiders ? Is it not those inside [ the church ] upon whom you are to pass disciplinary judgment [ passing censuring sentence on them as the facts require ] ?
46005013	God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside . Drive out that wicked one from among you [ expel him from your church ] .
46006001	DOES ANY of you dare , when he has a matter of complaint against another [ brother ] , to go to law before unrighteous men [ men neither upright nor right with God , laying it before them ] instead of before the saints ( the people of God ) ?
46006002	Do you not know that the saints ( the believers ) will [ one day ] judge and govern the world ? And if the world [ itself ] is to be judged and ruled by you , are you unworthy and incompetent to try [ such petty matters ] of the smallest courts of justice ?
46006003	Do you not know also that we [ Christians ] are to judge the [ very ] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [ for them ] ? How much more then [ as to ] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only !
46006004	If then you do have such cases of everyday life to decide , why do you appoint [ as judges to lay them before ] those who [ from the standpoint ] of the church count for least and are without standing ?
46006005	I say this to move you to shame . Can it be that there really is not one man among you who [ in action is governed by piety and integrity and ] is wise and competent enough to decide [ the private grievances , disputes , and quarrels ] between members of the brotherhood ,
46006006	But brother goes to law against brother , and that before [ Gentile judges who are ] unbelievers [ without faith or trust in the Gospel of Christ ] ?
46006007	Why , the very fact of your having lawsuits with one another at all is a defect ( a defeat , an evidence of positive moral loss for you ) . Why not rather let yourselves suffer wrong and be deprived of what is your due ? Why not rather be cheated ( defrauded and robbed ) ?
46006008	But [ instead it is you ] yourselves who wrong and defraud , and that even your own brethren [ by so treating them ] !
46006009	Do you not know that the unrighteous and the wrongdoers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived ( misled ) : neither the impure and immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor those who participate in homosexuality ,
46006010	Nor cheats ( swindlers and thieves ) , nor greedy graspers , nor drunkards , nor foulmouthed revilers and slanderers , nor extortioners and robbers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God .
46006011	And such some of you were [ once ] . But you were washed clean ( purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin ) , and you were consecrated ( set apart , hallowed ) , and you were justified [ pronounced righteous , by trusting ] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [ Holy ] Spirit of our God .
46006012	Everything is permissible ( allowable and lawful ) for me ; but not all things are helpful ( good for me to do , expedient and profitable when considered with other things ) . Everything is lawful for me , but I will not become the slave of anything or be brought under its power .
46006013	Food [ is intended ] for the stomach and the stomach for food , but God will finally end [ the functions of ] both and bring them to nothing . The body is not intended for sexual immorality , but [ is intended ] for the Lord , and the Lord [ is intended ] for the body [ to save , sanctify , and raise it again ] .
46006014	And God both raised the Lord to life and will also raise us up by His power .
46006015	Do you not see and know that your bodies are members ( bodily parts ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) ? Am I therefore to take the parts of Christ and make [ them ] parts of a prostitute ? Never ! Never !
46006016	Or do you not know and realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute , he becomes one body with her ? The two , it is written , shall become one flesh .
46006017	But the person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him .
46006018	Shun immorality and all sexual looseness [ flee from impurity in thought , word , or deed ] . Any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body , but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
46006019	Do you not know that your body is the temple ( the very sanctuary ) of the Holy Spirit Who lives within you , Whom you have received [ as a Gift ] from God ? You are not your own ,
46006020	You were bought with a price [ purchased with a preciousness and paid for , made His own ] . So then , honor God and bring glory to Him in your body .
46007001	NOW AS to the matters of which you wrote me . It is well [ and by that I mean advantageous , expedient , profitable , and wholesome ] for a man not to touch a woman [ to cohabit with her ] but to remain unmarried .
46007002	But because of the temptation to impurity and to avoid immorality , let each [ man ] have his own wife and let each [ woman ] have her own husband .
46007003	The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights ( goodwill , kindness , and what is due her as his wife ) , and likewise the wife to her husband .
46007004	For the wife does not have [ exclusive ] authority and control over her own body , but the husband [ has his rights ] ; likewise also the husband does not have [ exclusive ] authority and control over his body , but the wife [ has her rights ] .
46007005	Do not refuse and deprive and defraud each other [ of your due marital rights ] , except perhaps by mutual consent for a time , so that you may devote yourselves unhindered to prayer . But afterwards resume marital relations , lest Satan tempt you [ to sin ] through your lack of restraint of sexual desire .
46007006	But I am saying this more as a matter of permission and concession , not as a command or regulation .
46007007	I wish that all men were like I myself am [ in this matter of self-control ] . But each has his own special gift from God , one of this kind and one of another .
46007008	But to the unmarried people and to the widows , I declare that it is well ( good , advantageous , expedient , and wholesome ) for them to remain [ single ] even as I do .
46007009	But if they have not self-control ( restraint of their passions ) , they should marry . For it is better to marry than to be aflame [ with passion and tortured continually with ungratified desire ] .
46007010	But to the married people I give charge -- not I but the Lord -- that the wife is not to separate from her husband .
46007011	But if she does [ separate from and divorce him ] , let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband . And [ I charge ] the husband [ also ] that he should not put away or divorce his wife .
46007012	To the rest I declare -- I , not the Lord [ for Jesus did not discuss this ] -- that if any brother has a wife who does not believe [ in Christ ] and she consents to live with him , he should not leave or divorce her .
46007013	And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her , she should not leave or divorce him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband is set apart ( separated , withdrawn from heathen contamination , and affiliated with the Christian people ) by union with his consecrated ( set-apart ) wife , and the unbelieving wife is set apart and separated through union with her consecrated husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean ( unblessed heathen , outside the Christian covenant ) , but as it is they are prepared for God [ pure and clean ] .
46007015	But if the unbelieving partner [ actually ] leaves , let him do so ; in such [ cases the remaining ] brother or sister is not morally bound . But God has called us to peace .
46007016	For , wife , how can you be sure of converting and saving your husband ? Husband , how can you be sure of converting and saving your wife ?
46007017	Only , let each one [ seek to conduct himself and regulate his affairs so as to ] lead the life which the Lord has allotted and imparted to him and to which God has invited and summoned him . This is my order in all the churches .
46007018	Was anyone at the time of his summons [ from God ] already circumcised ? Let him not seek to remove the evidence of circumcision . Was anyone at the time [ God ] called him uncircumcised ? Let him not be circumcised .
46007019	For circumcision is nothing and counts for nothing , neither does uncircumcision , but [ what counts is ] keeping the commandments of God .
46007020	Everyone should remain after God calls him in the station or condition of life in which the summons found him .
46007021	Were you a slave when you were called ? Do not let that trouble you . But if you are able to gain your freedom , avail yourself of the opportunity .
46007022	For he who as a slave was summoned in [ to union with ] the Lord is a freedman of the Lord , just so he who was free when he was called is a bond servant of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
46007023	You were bought with a price [ purchased with a preciousness and paid for by Christ ] ; then do not yield yourselves up to become [ in your own estimation ] slaves to men [ but consider yourselves slaves to Christ ] .
46007024	So , brethren , in whatever station or state or condition of life each one was when he was called , there let him continue with and close to God .
46007025	Now concerning the virgins ( the marriageable maidens ) I have no command of the Lord , but I give my opinion and advice as one who by the Lord’s mercy is rendered trustworthy and faithful .
46007026	I think then , because of the impending distress [ that is even now setting in ] , it is well ( expedient , profitable , and wholesome ) for a person to remain as he or she is .
46007027	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be free . Are you free from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
46007028	But if you do marry , you do not sin [ in doing so ] , and if a virgin marries , she does not sin [ in doing so ] . Yet those who marry will have physical and earthly troubles , and I would like to spare you that .
46007029	I mean , brethren , the appointed time has been winding down and it has grown very short . From now on , let even those who have wives be as if they had none ,
46007030	And those who weep and mourn as though they were not weeping and mourning , and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing , and those who buy as though they did not possess anything ,
46007031	And those who deal with this world [ overusing the enjoyments of this life ] as though they were not absorbed by it and as if they had no dealings with it . For the outward form of this world ( the present world order ) is passing away .
46007032	My desire is to have you free from all anxiety and distressing care . The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord -- how he may please the Lord ;
46007033	But the married man is anxious about worldly matters -- how he may please his wife --
46007034	And he is drawn in diverging directions [ his interests are divided and he is distracted from his devotion to God ] . And the unmarried woman or girl is concerned and anxious about the matters of the Lord , how to be wholly separated and set apart in body and spirit ; but the married woman has her cares [ centered ] in earthly affairs -- how she may please her husband .
46007035	Now I say this for your own welfare and profit , not to put [ a halter of ] restraint upon you , but to promote what is seemly and in good order and to secure your undistracted and undivided devotion to the Lord .
46007036	But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward and in regard to his virgin [ that he is preparing disgrace for her or incurring reproach ] , in case she is passing the bloom of her youth and if there is need for it , let him do what to him seems right ; he does not sin ; let them marry .
46007037	But whoever is firmly established in his heart [ strong in mind and purpose ] , not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will and desire , and has resolved this in his heart to keep his own virginity , he is doing well .
46007038	So also then , he [ the father ] who gives his virgin ( his daughter ) in marriage does well , and he [ the father ] who does not give [ her ] in marriage does better .
46007039	A wife is bound to her husband by law as long as he lives . If the husband dies , she is free to be married to whom she will , only [ provided that he too is ] in the Lord .
46007040	But in my opinion [ a widow ] is happier ( more blessed and to be envied ) if she does not remarry . And also I think I have the Spirit of God .
46008001	NOW ABOUT food offered to idols : of course we know that all of us possess knowledge [ concerning these matters . Yet mere ] knowledge causes people to be puffed up ( to bear themselves loftily and be proud ) , but love ( affection and goodwill and benevolence ) edifies and builds up and encourages one to grow [ to his full stature ] .
46008002	If anyone imagines that he has come to know and understand much [ of divine things , without love ] , he does not yet perceive and recognize and understand as strongly and clearly , nor has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought or as is necessary .
46008003	But if one loves God truly [ with affectionate reverence , prompt obedience , and grateful recognition of His blessing ] , he is known by God [ recognized as worthy of His intimacy and love , and he is owned by Him ] .
46008004	In this matter , then , of eating food offered to idols , we know that an idol is nothing ( has no real existence ) and that there is no God but one .
46008005	For although there may be so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth , as indeed there are many of them , both of gods and of lords and masters ,
46008006	Yet for us there is [ only ] one God , the Father , Who is the Source of all things and for Whom we [ have life ] , and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through and by Whom are all things and through and by Whom we [ ourselves exist ] .
46008007	Nevertheless , not all [ believers ] possess this knowledge . But some , through being all their lives until now accustomed to [ thinking of ] idols [ as real and living ] , still consider the food [ offered to an idol ] as that sacrificed to an [ actual ] god ; and their weak consciences become defiled and injured if they eat [ it ] .
46008008	Now food [ itself ] will not cause our acceptance by God nor commend us to Him . Eating [ food offered to idols ] gives us no advantage ; neither do we come short or become any worse if we do not eat [ it ] .
46008009	Only be careful that this power of choice ( this permission and liberty to do as you please ) which is yours , does not [ somehow ] become a hindrance ( cause of stumbling ) to the weak or overscrupulous [ giving them an impulse to sin ] .
46008010	For suppose someone sees you , a man having knowledge [ of God , with an intelligent view of this subject and ] reclining at table in an idol’s temple , might he not be encouraged and emboldened [ to violate his own conscientious scruples ] if he is weak and uncertain , and eat what [ to him ] is for the purpose of idol worship ?
46008011	And so by your enlightenment ( your knowledge of spiritual things ) , this weak man is ruined ( is lost and perishes ) -- the brother for whom Christ ( the Messiah ) died !
46008012	And when you sin against your brethren in this way , wounding and damaging their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
46008013	Therefore , if [ my eating a ] food is a cause of my brother’s falling or of hindering [ his spiritual advancement ] , I will not eat [ such ] flesh forever , lest I cause my brother to be tripped up and fall and to be offended .
46009001	AM I not an apostle ( a special messenger ) ? Am I not free ( unrestrained and exempt from any obligation ) ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you [ yourselves ] not [ the product and proof of ] my workmanship in the Lord ?
46009002	Even if I am not considered an apostle ( a special messenger ) by others , at least I am one to you ; for you are the seal ( the certificate , the living evidence ) of my apostleship in the Lord [ confirming and authenticating it ] .
46009003	This is my [ real ground of ] defense ( my vindication of myself ) to those who would put me on trial and cross-examine me .
46009004	Have we not the right to our food and drink [ at the expense of the churches ] ?
46009005	Have we not the right also to take along with us a Christian sister as wife , as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas ( Peter ) ?
46009006	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from doing manual labor for a livelihood [ in order to go about the work of the ministry ] ?
46009007	[ Consider this : ] What soldier at any time serves at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of the fruit of it ? Who tends a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock ?
46009008	Do I say this only on human authority and as a man reasons ? Does not the Law endorse the same principle ?
46009009	For in the Law of Moses it is written , You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn . Is it [ only ] for oxen that God cares ?
46009010	Or does He speak certainly and entirely for our sakes ? [ Assuredly ] it is written for our sakes , because the plowman ought to plow in hope , and the thresher ought to thresh in expectation of partaking of the harvest .
46009011	If we have sown [ the seed of ] spiritual good among you , [ is it too ] much if we reap from your material benefits ?
46009012	If others share in this rightful claim upon you , do not we [ have a still better and greater claim ] ? However , we have never exercised this right , but we endure everything rather than put a hindrance in the way [ of the spread ] of the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ .
46009013	Do you not know that those men who are employed in the services of the temple get their food from the temple ? And that those who tend the altar share with the altar [ in the offerings brought ] ?
46009014	[ On the same principle ] the Lord directed that those who publish the good news ( the Gospel ) should live ( get their maintenance ) by the Gospel .
46009015	But I have not made use of any of these privileges , nor am I writing this [ to suggest ] that any such provision be made for me [ now ] . For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone make void and deprive me of my [ ground for ] glorifying [ in this matter ] .
46009016	For if I [ merely ] preach the Gospel , that gives me no reason to boast , for I feel compelled of necessity to do it . Woe is me if I do not preach the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) !
46009017	For if I do this work of my own free will , then I have my pay ( my reward ) ; but if it is not of my own will , but is done reluctantly and under compulsion , I am [ still ] entrusted with a [ sacred ] trusteeship and commission .
46009018	What then is the [ actual ] reward that I get ? Just this : that in my preaching the good news ( the Gospel ) , I may offer it [ absolutely ] free of expense [ to anybody ] , not taking advantage of my rights and privileges [ as a preacher ] of the Gospel .
46009019	For although I am free in every way from anyone’s control , I have made myself a bond servant to everyone , so that I might gain the more [ for Christ ] .
46009020	To the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might win Jews ; to men under the Law , [ I became ] as one under the Law , though not myself being under the Law , that I might win those under the Law .
46009021	To those without ( outside ) law I became as one without law , not that I am without the law of God and lawless toward Him , but that I am [ especially keeping ] within and committed to the law of Christ , that I might win those who are without law .
46009022	To the weak ( wanting in discernment ) I have become weak ( wanting in discernment ) that I might win the weak and overscrupulous . I have [ in short ] become all things to all men , that I might by all means ( at all costs and in any and every way ) save some [ by winning them to faith in Jesus Christ ] .
46009023	And I do this for the sake of the good news ( the Gospel ) , in order that I may become a participator in it and share in its [ blessings along with you ] .
46009024	Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete , but [ only ] one receives the prize ? So run [ your race ] that you may lay hold [ of the prize ] and make it yours .
46009025	Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately and restricts himself in all things . They do it to win a wreath that will soon wither , but we [ do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness ] that cannot wither .
46009026	Therefore I do not run uncertainly ( without definite aim ) . I do not box like one beating the air and striking without an adversary .
46009027	But [ like a boxer ] I buffet my body [ handle it roughly , discipline it by hardships ] and subdue it , for fear that after proclaiming to others the Gospel and things pertaining to it , I myself should become unfit [ not stand the test , be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit ] .
46010001	FOR I do not want you to be ignorant , brethren , that our forefathers were all under and protected by the cloud [ in which God’s Presence went before them ] , and every one of them passed safely through the [ Red ] Sea ,
46010002	And each one of them [ allowed himself also ] to be baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea [ they were thus brought under obligation to the Law , to Moses , and to the covenant , consecrated and set apart to the service of God ] ;
46010003	And all [ of them ] ate the same spiritual ( supernaturally given ) food ,
46010004	And they all drank the same spiritual ( supernaturally given ) drink . For they drank from a spiritual Rock which followed them [ produced by the sole power of God Himself without natural instrumentality ] , and the Rock was Christ .
46010005	Nevertheless , God was not pleased with the great majority of them , for they were overthrown and strewn down along [ the ground ] in the wilderness .
46010006	Now these things are examples ( warnings and admonitions ) for us not to desire or crave or covet or lust after evil and carnal things as they did .
46010007	Do not be worshipers of false gods as some of them were , as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink [ the sacrifices offered to the golden calf at Horeb ] and rose to sport ( to dance and give way to jesting and hilarity ) .
46010008	We must not gratify evil desire and indulge in immorality as some of them did -- and twenty-three thousand [ suddenly ] fell dead in a single day !
46010009	We should not tempt the Lord [ try His patience , become a trial to Him , critically appraise Him , and exploit His goodness ] as some of them did -- and were killed by poisonous serpents ;
46010010	Nor discontentedly complain as some of them did -- and were put out of the way entirely by the destroyer ( death ) .
46010011	Now these things befell them by way of a figure [ as an example and warning to us ] ; they were written to admonish and fit us for right action by good instruction , we in whose days the ages have reached their climax ( their consummation and concluding period ) .
46010012	Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands [ who feels sure that he has a steadfast mind and is standing firm ] , take heed lest he fall [ into sin ] .
46010013	For no temptation ( no trial regarded as enticing to sin ) , [ no matter how it comes or where it leads ] has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man [ that is , no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance and that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to human experience , and such as man can bear ] . But God is faithful [ to His Word and to His compassionate nature ] , and He [ can be trusted ] not to let you be tempted and tried and assayed beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure , but with the temptation He will [ always ] also provide the way out ( the means of escape to a landing place ) , that you may be capable and strong and powerful to bear up under it patiently .
46010014	Therefore , my dearly beloved , shun ( keep clear away from , avoid by flight if need be ) any sort of idolatry ( of loving or venerating anything more than God ) .
46010015	I am speaking as to intelligent ( sensible ) men . Think over and make up your minds [ for yourselves ] about what I say . [ I appeal to your reason and your discernment in these matters . ]
46010016	The cup of blessing [ of wine at the Lord’s Supper ] upon which we ask [ God’s ] blessing , does it not mean [ that in drinking it ] we participate in and share a fellowship ( a communion ) in the blood of Christ ( the Messiah ) ? The bread which we break , does it not mean [ that in eating it ] we participate in and share a fellowship ( a communion ) in the body of Christ ?
46010017	For we [ no matter how ] numerous we are , are one body , because we all partake of the one Bread [ the One Whom the communion bread represents ] .
46010018	Consider those [ physically ] people of Israel . Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners of the altar [ united in their worship of the same God ] ?
46010019	What do I imply then ? That food offered to idols is [ intrinsically changed by the fact and amounts to ] anything or that an idol itself is a [ living ] thing ?
46010020	No , I am suggesting that what the pagans sacrifice they offer [ in effect ] to demons ( to evil spiritual powers ) and not to God [ at all ] . I do not want you to fellowship and be partners with diabolical spirits [ by eating at their feasts ] .
46010021	You cannot drink the Lord’s cup and the demons’ cup . You cannot partake of the Lord’s table and the demons’ table .
46010022	Shall we thus provoke the Lord to jealousy and anger and indignation ? Are we stronger than He [ that we should defy Him ] ?
46010023	All things are legitimate [ permissible -- and we are free to do anything we please ] , but not all things are helpful ( expedient , profitable , and wholesome ) . All things are legitimate , but not all things are constructive [ to character ] and edifying [ to spiritual life ] .
46010024	Let no one then seek his own good and advantage and profit , but [ rather ] each one of the other [ let him seek the welfare of his neighbor ] .
46010025	[ As to meat offered to idols ] eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question or investigating on the grounds of conscientious scruples ,
46010026	For the [ whole ] earth is the Lord’s and everything that is in it .
46010027	In case one of the unbelievers invites you to a meal and you want to go , eat whatever is served to you without examining into its source because of conscientious scruples .
46010028	But if someone tells you , This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol , do not eat it , out of consideration for the person who informed you , and for conscience’s sake --
46010029	I mean for the sake of his conscience , not yours , [ do not eat it ] . For why should another man’s scruples apply to me and my liberty of action be determined by his conscience ?
46010030	If I partake [ of my food ] with thankfulness , why am I accused and spoken evil of because of that for which I give thanks ?
46010031	So then , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you may do , do all for the honor and glory of God .
46010032	Do not let yourselves be [ hindrances by giving ] an offense to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God [ do not lead others into sin by your mode of life ] ;
46010033	Just as I myself strive to please [ to accommodate myself to the opinions , desires , and interests of others , adapting myself to ] all men in everything I do , not aiming at or considering my own profit and advantage , but that of the many in order that they may be saved .
46011001	PATTERN YOURSELVES after me [ follow my example ] , as I imitate and follow Christ ( the Messiah ) .
46011002	I appreciate and commend you because you always remember me in everything and keep firm possession of the traditions ( the substance of my instructions ) , just as I have [ verbally ] passed them on to you .
46011003	But I want you to know and realize that Christ is the Head of every man , the head of a woman is her husband , and the Head of Christ is God .
46011004	Any man who prays or prophesies ( teaches , refutes , reproves , admonishes , and comforts ) with his head covered dishonors his Head ( Christ ) .
46011005	And any woman who [ publicly ] prays or prophesies ( teaches , refutes , reproves , admonishes , or comforts ) when she is bareheaded dishonors her head ( her husband ) ; it is the same as [ if her head were ] shaved .
46011006	For if a woman will not wear [ a head ] covering , then she should cut off her hair too ; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaven , let her cover [ her head ] .
46011007	For a man ought not to wear anything on his head [ in church ] , for he is the image and [ reflected ] glory of God [ his function of government reflects the majesty of the divine Rule ] ; but woman is [ the expression of ] man’s glory ( majesty , preeminence ) .
46011008	For man was not [ created ] from woman , but woman from man ;
46011009	Neither was man created on account of or for the benefit of woman , but woman on account of and for the benefit of man .
46011010	Therefore she should [ be subject to his authority and should ] have a covering on her head [ as a token , a symbol , of her submission to authority , that she may show reverence as do ] the angels [ and not displease them ] .
46011011	Nevertheless , in [ the plan of ] the Lord and from His point of view woman is not apart from and independent of man , nor is man aloof from and independent of woman ;
46011012	For as woman was made from man , even so man is also born of woman ; and all [ whether male or female go forth ] from God [ as their Author ] .
46011013	Consider for yourselves ; is it proper and decent [ according to your customs ] for a woman to offer prayer to God [ publicly ] with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Does not the native sense of propriety ( experience , common sense , reason ) itself teach you that for a man to wear long hair is a dishonor [ humiliating and degrading ] to him ,
46011015	But if a woman has long hair , it is her ornament and glory ? For her hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	Now if anyone is disposed to be argumentative and contentious about this , we hold to and recognize no other custom [ in worship ] than this , nor do the churches of God generally .
46011017	But in what I instruct [ you ] next I do not commend [ you ] , because when you meet together , it is not for the better but for the worse .
46011018	For in the first place , when you assemble as a congregation , I hear that there are cliques ( divisions and factions ) among you ; and I in part believe it ,
46011019	For doubtless there have to be factions or parties among you in order that they who are genuine and of approved fitness may become evident and plainly recognized among you .
46011020	So when you gather for your meetings , it is not the supper instituted by the Lord that you eat ,
46011021	For in eating each one [ hurries ] to get his own supper first [ not waiting for the poor ] , and one goes hungry while another gets drunk .
46011022	What ! Do you have no houses in which to eat and drink ? Or do you despise the church of God and mean to show contempt for it , while you humiliate those who are poor ( have no homes and have brought no food ) ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I commend you in this ? No , [ most certainly ] I will not !
46011023	For I received from the Lord Himself that which I passed on to you [ it was given to me personally ] , that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was treacherously delivered up and while His betrayal was in progress took bread ,
46011024	And when He had given thanks , He broke [ it ] and said , Take , eat . This is My body , which is broken for you . Do this to call Me [ affectionately ] to remembrance .
46011025	Similarly when supper was ended , He took the cup also , saying , This cup is the new covenant [ ratified and established ] in My blood . Do this , as often as you drink [ it ] , to call Me [ affectionately ] to remembrance .
46011026	For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup , you are representing and signifying and proclaiming the fact of the Lord’s death until He comes [ again ] .
46011027	So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [ of Him ] will be guilty of [ profaning and sinning against ] the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	Let a man [ thoroughly ] examine himself , and [ only when he has done ] so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
46011029	For anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating and recognizing with due appreciation that [ it is Christ’s ] body , eats and drinks a sentence ( a verdict of judgment ) upon himself .
46011030	That [ careless and unworthy participation ] is the reason many of you are weak and sickly , and quite enough of you have fallen into the sleep of death .
46011031	For if we searchingly examined ourselves [ detecting our shortcomings and recognizing our own condition ] , we should not be judged and penalty decreed [ by the divine judgment ] .
46011032	But when we [ fall short and ] are judged by the Lord , we are disciplined and chastened , so that we may not [ finally ] be condemned [ to eternal punishment along ] with the world .
46011033	So then , my brothers , when you gather together to eat [ the Lord’s Supper ] , wait for one another .
46011034	If anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest you come together to bring judgment [ on yourselves ] . About the other matters , I will give you directions [ personally ] when I come .
46012001	NOW ABOUT the spiritual gifts ( the special endowments of supernatural energy ) , brethren , I do not want you to be misinformed .
46012002	You know that when you were heathen , you were led off after idols that could not speak [ habitually ] as impulse directed and whenever the occasion might arise .
46012003	Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking under the power and influence of the [ Holy ] Spirit of God can [ ever ] say , Jesus be cursed ! And no one can [ really ] say , Jesus is [ my ] Lord , except by and under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Now there are distinctive varieties and distributions of endowments ( gifts , extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians , due to the power of divine grace operating in their souls by the Holy Spirit ) and they vary , but the [ Holy ] Spirit remains the same .
46012005	And there are distinctive varieties of service and ministration , but it is the same Lord [ Who is served ] .
46012006	And there are distinctive varieties of operation [ of working to accomplish things ] , but it is the same God Who inspires and energizes them all in all .
46012007	But to each one is given the manifestation of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ the evidence , the spiritual illumination of the Spirit ] for good and profit .
46012008	To one is given in and through the [ Holy ] Spirit [ the power to speak ] a message of wisdom , and to another [ the power to express ] a word of knowledge and understanding according to the same [ Holy ] Spirit ;
46012009	To another [ wonder-working ] faith by the same [ Holy ] Spirit , to another the extraordinary powers of healing by the one Spirit ;
46012010	To another the working of miracles , to another prophetic insight ( the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose ) ; to another the ability to discern and distinguish between [ the utterances of true ] spirits [ and false ones ] , to another various kinds of [ unknown ] tongues , to another the ability to interpret [ such ] tongues .
46012011	All these [ gifts , achievements , abilities ] are inspired and brought to pass by one and the same [ Holy ] Spirit , Who apportions to each person individually [ exactly ] as He chooses .
46012012	For just as the body is a unity and yet has many parts , and all the parts , though many , form [ only ] one body , so it is with Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
46012013	For by [ means of the personal agency of ] one [ Holy ] Spirit we were all , whether Jews or Greeks , slaves or free , baptized [ and by baptism united together ] into one body , and all made to drink of one [ Holy ] Spirit .
46012014	For the body does not consist of one limb or organ but of many .
46012015	If the foot should say , Because I am not the hand , I do not belong to the body , would it be therefore not [ a part ] of the body ?
46012016	If the ear should say , Because I am not the eye , I do not belong to the body , would it be therefore not [ a part ] of the body ?
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where [ would be the sense of ] hearing ? If the whole body were an ear , where [ would be the sense of ] smell ?
46012018	But as it is , God has placed and arranged the limbs and organs in the body , each [ particular one ] of them , just as He wished and saw fit and with the best adaptation .
46012019	But if [ the whole ] were all a single organ , where would the body be ?
46012020	And now there are [ certainly ] many limbs and organs , but a single body .
46012021	And the eye is not able to say to the hand , I have no need of you , nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
46012022	But instead , there is [ absolute ] necessity for the parts of the body that are considered the more weak .
46012023	And those [ parts ] of the body which we consider rather ignoble are [ the very parts ] which we invest with additional honor , and our unseemly parts and those unsuitable for exposure are treated with seemliness ( modesty and decorum ) ,
46012024	Which our more presentable parts do not require . But God has so adjusted ( mingled , harmonized , and subtly proportioned the parts of ) the whole body , giving the greater honor and richer endowment to the inferior parts which lack [ apparent importance ] ,
46012025	So that there should be no division or discord or lack of adaptation [ of the parts of the body to each other ] , but the members all alike should have a mutual interest in and care for one another .
46012026	And if one member suffers , all the parts [ share ] the suffering ; if one member is honored , all the members [ share in ] the enjoyment of it .
46012027	Now you [ collectively ] are Christ’s body and [ individually ] you are members of it , each part severally and distinct [ each with his own place and function ] .
46012028	So God has appointed some in the church [ for His own use ] : first apostles ( special messengers ) ; second prophets ( inspired preachers and expounders ) ; third teachers ; then wonder-workers ; then those with ability to heal the sick ; helpers ; administrators ; [ speakers in ] different ( unknown ) tongues .
46012029	Are all apostles ( special messengers ) ? Are all prophets ( inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God ) ? Are all teachers ? Do all have the power of performing miracles ?
46012030	Do all possess extraordinary powers of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	But earnestly desire and zealously cultivate the greatest and best gifts and graces ( the higher gifts and the choicest graces ) . And yet I will show you a still more excellent way [ one that is better by far and the highest of them all -- love ] .
46013001	IF I [ can ] speak in the tongues of men and [ even ] of angels , but have not love ( that reasoning , intentional , spiritual devotion such as is inspired by God’s love for and in us ) , I am only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	And if I have prophetic powers ( the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose ) , and understand all the secret truths and mysteries and possess all knowledge , and if I have [ sufficient ] faith so that I can remove mountains , but have not love ( God’s love in me ) I am nothing ( a useless nobody ) .
46013003	Even if I dole out all that I have [ to the poor in providing ] food , and if I surrender my body to be burned or in order that I may glory , but have not love ( God’s love in me ) , I gain nothing .
46013004	Love endures long and is patient and kind ; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy , is not boastful or vainglorious , does not display itself haughtily .
46013005	It is not conceited ( arrogant and inflated with pride ) ; it is not rude ( unmannerly ) and does not act unbecomingly . Love ( God’s love in us ) does not insist on its own rights or its own way , for it is not self-seeking ; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful ; it takes no account of the evil done to it [ it pays no attention to a suffered wrong ] .
46013006	It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness , but rejoices when right and truth prevail .
46013007	Love bears up under anything and everything that comes , is ever ready to believe the best of every person , its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances , and it endures everything [ without weakening ] .
46013008	Love never fails [ never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end ] . As for prophecy ( the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose ) , it will be fulfilled and pass away ; as for tongues , they will be destroyed and cease ; as for knowledge , it will pass away [ it will lose its value and be superseded by truth ] .
46013009	For our knowledge is fragmentary ( incomplete and imperfect ) , and our prophecy ( our teaching ) is fragmentary ( incomplete and imperfect ) .
46013010	But when the complete and perfect ( total ) comes , the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away ( become antiquated , void , and superseded ) .
46013011	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child ; now that I have become a man , I am done with childish ways and have put them aside .
46013012	For now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim ( blurred ) reflection [ of reality as in a riddle or enigma ] , but then [ when perfection comes ] we shall see in reality and face to face ! Now I know in part ( imperfectly ) , but then I shall know and understand fully and clearly , even in the same manner as I have been fully and clearly known and understood [ by God ] .
46013013	And so faith , hope , love abide [ faith -- conviction and belief respecting man’s relation to God and divine things ; hope -- joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation ; love -- true affection for God and man , growing out of God’s love for and in us ] , these three ; but the greatest of these is love .
46014001	EAGERLY PURSUE and seek to acquire [ this ] love [ make it your aim , your great quest ] ; and earnestly desire and cultivate the spiritual endowments ( gifts ) , especially that you may prophesy ( interpret the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching ) .
46014002	For one who speaks in an [ unknown ] tongue speaks not to men but to God , for no one understands or catches his meaning , because in the [ Holy ] Spirit he utters secret truths and hidden things [ not obvious to the understanding ] .
46014003	But [ on the other hand ] , the one who prophesies [ who interprets the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching ] speaks to men for their upbuilding and constructive spiritual progress and encouragement and consolation .
46014004	He who speaks in a [ strange ] tongue edifies and improves himself , but he who prophesies [ interpreting the divine will and purpose and teaching with inspiration ] edifies and improves the church and promotes growth [ in Christian wisdom , piety , holiness , and happiness ] .
46014005	Now I wish that you might all speak in [ unknown ] tongues , but more especially [ I want you ] to prophesy ( to be inspired to preach and interpret the divine will and purpose ) . He who prophesies [ who is inspired to preach and teach ] is greater ( more useful and more important ) than he who speaks in [ unknown ] tongues , unless he should interpret [ what he says ] , so that the church may be edified and receive good [ from it ] .
46014006	Now , brethren , if I come to you speaking in [ unknown ] tongues , how shall I make it to your advantage unless I speak to you either in revelation ( disclosure of God’s will to man ) in knowledge or in prophecy or in instruction ?
46014007	If even inanimate musical instruments , such as the flute or the harp , do not give distinct notes , how will anyone [ listening ] know or understand what is played ?
46014008	And if the war bugle gives an uncertain ( indistinct ) call , who will prepare for battle ?
46014009	Just so it is with you ; if you in the [ unknown ] tongue speak words that are not intelligible , how will anyone understand what you are saying ? For you will be talking into empty space !
46014010	There are , I suppose , all these many [ to us unknown ] tongues in the world [ somewhere ] , and none is destitute of [ its own power of ] expression and meaning .
46014011	But if I do not know the force and significance of the speech ( language ) , I shall seem to be a foreigner to the one who speaks [ to me ] , and the speaker who addresses [ me ] will seem a foreigner to me .
46014012	So it is with yourselves ; since you are so eager and ambitious to possess spiritual endowments and manifestations of the [ Holy ] Spirit , [ concentrate on ] striving to excel and to abound [ in them ] in ways that will build up the church .
46014013	Therefore , the person who speaks in an [ unknown ] tongue should pray [ for the power ] to interpret and explain what he says .
46014014	For if I pray in an [ unknown ] tongue , my spirit [ by the Holy Spirit within me ] prays , but my mind is unproductive [ it bears no fruit and helps nobody ] .
46014015	Then what am I to do ? I will pray with my spirit [ by the Holy Spirit that is within me ] , but I will also pray [ intelligently ] with my mind and understanding ; I will sing with my spirit [ by the Holy Spirit that is within me ] , but I will sing [ intelligently ] with my mind and understanding also .
46014016	Otherwise , if you bless and render thanks with [ your ] spirit [ thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit ] , how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with [ interpreting of unknown ] tongues , say the Amen to your thanksgiving , since he does not know what you are saying ?
46014017	To be sure , you may give thanks well ( nobly ) , but the bystander is not edified [ it does him no good ] .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in [ strange ] tongues ( languages ) more than any of you or all of you put together ;
46014019	Nevertheless , in public worship , I would rather say five words with my understanding and intelligently in order to instruct others , than ten thousand words in a [ strange ] tongue ( language ) .
46014020	Brethren , do not be children [ immature ] in your thinking ; continue to be babes in [ matters of ] evil , but in your minds be mature [ men ] .
46014021	It is written in the Law , By men of strange languages and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people , and not even then will they listen to Me , says the Lord .
46014022	Thus [ unknown ] tongues are meant for a [ supernatural ] sign , not for believers but for unbelievers [ on the point of believing ] , while prophecy ( inspired preaching and teaching , interpreting the divine will and purpose ) is not for unbelievers [ on the point of believing ] but for believers .
46014023	Therefore , if the whole church assembles and all of you speak in [ unknown ] tongues , and the ungifted and uninitiated or unbelievers come in , will they not say that you are demented ?
46014024	But if all prophesy [ giving inspired testimony and interpreting the divine will and purpose ] and an unbeliever or untaught outsider comes in , he is told of his sin and reproved and convicted and convinced by all , and his defects and needs are examined ( estimated , determined ) and he is called to account by all ,
46014025	The secrets of his heart are laid bare ; and so , falling on [ his ] face , he will worship God , declaring that God is among you in very truth .
46014026	What then , brethren , is [ the right course ] ? When you meet together , each one has a hymn , a teaching , a disclosure of special knowledge or information , an utterance in a [ strange ] tongue , or an interpretation of it . [ But ] let everything be constructive and edifying and for the good of all .
46014027	If some speak in a [ strange ] tongue , let the number be limited to two or at the most three , and each one [ taking his ] turn , and let one interpret and explain [ what is said ] .
46014028	But if there is no one to do the interpreting , let each of them keep still in church and talk to himself and to God .
46014029	So let two or three prophets speak [ those inspired to preach or teach ] , while the rest pay attention and weigh and discern what is said .
46014030	But if an inspired revelation comes to another who is sitting by , then let the first one be silent .
46014031	For in this way you can give testimony [ prophesying and thus interpreting the divine will and purpose ] one by one , so that all may be instructed and all may be stimulated and encouraged ;
46014032	For the spirits of the prophets ( the speakers in tongues ) are under the speaker’s control [ and subject to being silenced as may be necessary ] ,
46014033	For He [ Who is the source of their prophesying ] is not a God of confusion and disorder but of peace and order . As [ is the practice ] in all the churches of the saints ( God’s people ) ,
46014034	The women should keep quiet in the churches , for they are not authorized to speak , but should take a secondary and subordinate place , just as the Law also says .
46014035	But if there is anything they want to learn , they should ask their own husbands at home , for it is disgraceful for a woman to talk in church [ for her to usurp and exercise authority over men in the church ] .
46014036	What ! Did the word of the Lord originate with you [ Corinthians ] , or has it reached only you ?
46014037	If anyone thinks and claims that he is a prophet [ filled with and governed by the Holy Spirit of God and inspired to interpret the divine will and purpose in preaching or teaching ] or has any other spiritual endowment , let him understand ( recognize and acknowledge ) that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord .
46014038	But if anyone disregards or does not recognize [ that it is a command of the Lord ] , he is disregarded and not recognized [ he is one whom God knows not ] .
46014039	So [ to conclude ] , my brethren , earnestly desire and set your hearts on prophesying ( on being inspired to preach and teach and to interpret God’s will and purpose ) , and do not forbid or hinder speaking in [ unknown ] tongues .
46014040	But all things should be done with regard to decency and propriety and in an orderly fashion .
46015001	AND NOW let me remind you [ since it seems to have escaped you ] , brethren , of the Gospel ( the glad tidings of salvation ) which I proclaimed to you , which you welcomed and accepted and upon which your faith rests ,
46015002	And by which you are saved , if you hold fast and keep firmly what I preached to you , unless you believed at first without effect and all for nothing .
46015003	For I passed on to you first of all what I also had received , that Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) died for our sins in accordance with [ what ] the Scriptures [ foretold ] ,
46015004	That He was buried , that He arose on the third day as the Scriptures foretold ,
46015005	And [ also ] that He appeared to Cephas ( Peter ) , then to the Twelve .
46015006	Then later He showed Himself to more than five hundred brethren at one time , the majority of whom are still alive , but some have fallen asleep [ in death ] .
46015007	Afterward He was seen by James , then by all the apostles ( the special messengers ) ,
46015008	And last of all He appeared to me also , as to one prematurely and born dead [ no better than an unperfected fetus among living men ] .
46015009	For I am the least [ worthy ] of the apostles , who am not fit or deserving to be called an apostle , because I once wronged and pursued and molested the church of God [ oppressing it with cruelty and violence ] .
46015010	But by the grace ( the unmerited favor and blessing ) of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me was not [ found to be ] for nothing ( fruitless and without effect ) . In fact , I worked harder than all of them [ the apostles ] , though it was not really I , but the grace ( the unmerited favor and blessing ) of God which was with me .
46015011	So , whether then it was I or they , this is what we preach and this is what you believed [ what you adhered to , trusted in , and relied on ] .
46015012	But now if Christ ( the Messiah ) is preached as raised from the dead , how is it that some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , then Christ has not risen ;
46015014	And if Christ has not risen , then our preaching is in vain [ it amounts to nothing ] and your faith is devoid of truth and is fruitless ( without effect , empty , imaginary , and unfounded ) .
46015015	We are even discovered to be misrepresenting God , for we testified of Him that He raised Christ , Whom He did not raise in case it is true that the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised ;
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is mere delusion [ futile , fruitless ] , and you are still in your sins [ under the control and penalty of sin ] ;
46015018	And further , those who have died in [ spiritual fellowship and union with ] Christ have perished ( are lost ) !
46015019	If we who are [ abiding ] in Christ have hope only in this life and that is all , then we are of all people most miserable and to be pitied .
46015020	But the fact is that Christ ( the Messiah ) has been raised from the dead , and He became the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [ in death ] .
46015021	For since [ it was ] through a man that death [ came into the world , it is ] also through a Man that the resurrection of the dead [ has come ] .
46015022	For just as [ because of their union of nature ] in Adam all people die , so also [ by virtue of their union of nature ] shall all in Christ be made alive .
46015023	But each in his own rank and turn : Christ ( the Messiah ) [ is ] the firstfruits , then those who are Christ’s [ own will be resurrected ] at His coming .
46015024	After that comes the end ( the completion ) , when He delivers over the kingdom to God the Father after rendering inoperative and abolishing every [ other ] rule and every authority and power .
46015025	For [ Christ ] must be King and reign until He has put all [ His ] enemies under His feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be subdued and abolished is death .
46015027	For He [ the Father ] has put all things in subjection under His [ Christ’s ] feet . But when it says , All things are put in subjection [ under Him ] , it is evident that He [ Himself ] is excepted Who does the subjecting of all things to Him .
46015028	However , when everything is subjected to Him , then the Son Himself will also subject Himself to [ the Father ] Who put all things under Him , so that God may be all in all [ be everything to everyone , supreme , the indwelling and controlling factor of life ] .
46015029	Otherwise , what do people mean by being [ themselves ] baptized in behalf of the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people baptized for them ?
46015030	[ For that matter ] , why do I live [ dangerously as I do , running such risks that I am ] in peril every hour ?
46015031	[ I assure you ] by the pride which I have in you in [ your fellowship and union with ] Christ Jesus our Lord , that I die daily [ I face death every day and die to self ] .
46015032	What do I gain if , merely from the human point of view , I fought with [ wild ] beasts at Ephesus ? If the dead are not raised [ at all ] , let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we will be dead .
46015033	Do not be so deceived and misled ! Evil companionships ( communion , associations ) corrupt and deprave good manners and morals and character .
46015034	Awake [ from your drunken stupor and return ] to sober sense and your right minds , and sin no more . For some of you have not the knowledge of God [ you are utterly and willfully and disgracefully ignorant , and continue to be so , lacking the sense of God’s presence and all true knowledge of Him ] . I say this to your shame .
46015035	But someone will say , How can the dead be raised ? With what [ kind of ] body will they come forth ?
46015036	You foolish man ! Every time you plant seed , you sow something that does not come to life [ germinating , springing up , and growing ] unless it dies first .
46015037	Nor is the seed you sow then the body which it is going to have [ later ] , but it is a naked kernel , perhaps of wheat or some of the rest of the grains .
46015038	But God gives to it the body that He plans and sees fit , and to each kind of seed a body of its own .
46015039	For all flesh is not the same , but there is one kind for humans , another for beasts , another for birds , and another for fish .
46015040	There are heavenly bodies ( sun , moon , and stars ) and there are earthly bodies ( men , animals , and plants ) , but the beauty and glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind , while the beauty and glory of earthly bodies is a different kind .
46015041	The sun is glorious in one way , the moon is glorious in another way , and the stars are glorious in their own [ distinctive ] way ; for one star differs from and surpasses another in its beauty and brilliance .
46015042	So it is with the resurrection of the dead . [ The body ] that is sown is perishable and decays , but [ the body ] that is resurrected is imperishable ( immune to decay , immortal ) .
46015043	It is sown in dishonor and humiliation ; it is raised in honor and glory . It is sown in infirmity and weakness ; it is resurrected in strength and endued with power .
46015044	It is sown a natural ( physical ) body ; it is raised a supernatural ( a spiritual ) body . [ As surely as ] there is a physical body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	Thus it is written , The first man Adam became a living being ( an individual personality ) ; the last Adam ( Christ ) became a life-giving Spirit [ restoring the dead to life ] .
46015046	But it is not the spiritual life which came first , but the physical and then the spiritual .
46015047	The first man [ was ] from out of earth , made of dust ( earthly-minded ) ; the second Man [ is ] the Lord from out of heaven .
46015048	Now those who are made of the dust are like him who was first made of the dust ( earthly-minded ) ; and as is [ the Man ] from heaven , so also [ are those ] who are of heaven ( heavenly-minded ) .
46015049	And just as we have borne the image [ of the man ] of dust , so shall we and so let us also bear the image [ of the Man ] of heaven .
46015050	But I tell you this , brethren , flesh and blood cannot [ become partakers of eternal salvation and ] inherit or share in the kingdom of God ; nor does the perishable ( that which is decaying ) inherit or share in the imperishable ( the immortal ) .
46015051	Take notice ! I tell you a mystery ( a secret truth , an event decreed by the hidden purpose or counsel of God ) . We shall not all fall asleep [ in death ] , but we shall all be changed ( transformed )
46015052	In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the [ sound of the ] last trumpet call . For a trumpet will sound , and the dead [ in Christ ] will be raised imperishable ( free and immune from decay ) , and we shall be changed ( transformed ) .
46015053	For this perishable [ part of us ] must put on the imperishable [ nature ] , and this mortal [ part of us , this nature that is capable of dying ] must put on immortality ( freedom from death ) .
46015054	And when this perishable puts on the imperishable and this that was capable of dying puts on freedom from death , then shall be fulfilled the Scripture that says , Death is swallowed up ( utterly vanquished forever ) in and unto victory .
46015055	O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ?
46015056	Now sin is the sting of death , and sin exercises its power [ upon the soul ] through [ the abuse of ] the Law .
46015057	But thanks be to God , Who gives us the victory [ making us conquerors ] through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be firm ( steadfast ) , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord [ always being superior , excelling , doing more than enough in the service of the Lord ] , knowing and being continually aware that your labor in the Lord is not futile [ it is never wasted or to no purpose ] .
46016001	NOW CONCERNING the money contributed for [ the relief of ] the saints ( God’s people ) : you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia to do .
46016002	On the first [ day ] of each week , let each one of you [ personally ] put aside something and save it up as he has prospered [ in proportion to what he is given ] , so that no collections will need to be taken after I come .
46016003	And when I arrive , I will send on those whom you approve and authorize with credentials to carry your gift [ of charity ] to Jerusalem .
46016004	If it seems worthwhile that I should go too , they will accompany me .
46016005	After passing through Macedonia , I will visit you , for I intend [ only ] to pass through Macedonia ;
46016006	But it may be that I will stay with you [ for a while ] , perhaps even spend the winter , so that you may bring me forward [ on my journey ] to wherever I may go .
46016007	For I am unwilling to see you right now [ just ] in passing , but I hope later to remain for some time with you , if the Lord permits .
46016008	I will remain in Ephesus [ however ] until Pentecost ,
46016009	For a wide door of opportunity for effectual [ service ] has opened to me [ there , a great and promising one ] , and [ there are ] many adversaries .
46016010	When Timothy arrives , see to it that [ you put him at ease , so that ] he may be fearless among you , for he is [ devotedly ] doing the Lord’s work , just as I am .
46016011	So [ see to it that ] no one despises him or treats him as if he were of no account or slights him . But send him off [ cordially , speed him on his way ] in peace , that he may come to me , for I am expecting him [ to come along ] with the other brethren .
46016012	As for our brother Apollos , I have urgently encouraged him to visit you with the other brethren , but it was not at all his will or God’s will that he should go now . He will come when he has opportunity .
46016013	Be alert and on your guard ; stand firm in your faith ( your conviction respecting man’s relationship to God and divine things , keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it ) . Act like men and be courageous ; grow in strength !
46016014	Let everything you do be done in love ( true love to God and man as inspired by God’s love for us ) .
46016015	Now , brethren , you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts and our firstfruits in Achaia ( most of Greece ) , and how they have consecrated and devoted themselves to the service of the saints ( God’s people ) .
46016016	I urge you to pay all deference to such leaders and to enlist under them and be subject to them , as well as to everyone who joins and cooperates [ with you ] and labors earnestly .
46016017	I am happy because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come [ to me ] , for they have made up for your absence .
46016018	For they gave me respite from labor and rested me and refreshed my spirit as well as yours . Deeply appreciate and thoroughly know and fully recognize such men .
46016019	The churches of Asia send greetings and best wishes . Aquila and Prisca , together with the church [ that meets ] in their house , send you their hearty greetings in the Lord .
46016020	All the brethren wish to be remembered to you and wish you well . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	I , Paul , [ add this final ] greeting with my own hand .
46016022	If anyone does not love the Lord [ does not have a friendly affection for Him and is not kindly disposed toward Him ] , he shall be accursed ! Our Lord will come ! ( Maranatha ! )
46016023	The grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
46016024	My love ( that true love growing out of sincere devotion to God ) be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen ( so be it ) .
47001001	PAUL , AN apostle ( a special messenger ) of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy [ our ] brother , to the church ( assembly ) of God which is at Corinth , and to all the saints ( the people of God ) throughout Achaia ( most of Greece ) :
47001002	Grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) to you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
47001003	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of sympathy ( pity and mercy ) and the God [ Who is the Source ] of every comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) ,
47001004	Who comforts ( consoles and encourages ) us in every trouble ( calamity and affliction ) , so that we may also be able to comfort ( console and encourage ) those who are in any kind of trouble or distress , with the comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) with which we ourselves are comforted ( consoled and encouraged ) by God .
47001005	For just as Christ’s [ own ] sufferings fall to our lot [ as they overflow upon His disciples , and we share and experience them ] abundantly , so through Christ comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) is also [ shared and experienced ] abundantly by us .
47001006	But if we are troubled ( afflicted and distressed ) , it is for your comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) and [ for your ] salvation ; and if we are comforted ( consoled and encouraged ) , it is for your comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) , which works [ in you ] when you patiently endure the same evils ( misfortunes and calamities ) that we also suffer and undergo .
47001007	And our hope for you [ our joyful and confident expectation of good for you ] is ever unwavering ( assured and unshaken ) ; for we know that just as you share and are partners in [ our ] sufferings and calamities , you also share and are partners in [ our ] comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) .
47001008	For we do not want you to be uninformed , brethren , about the affliction and oppressing distress which befell us in [ the province of ] Asia , how we were so utterly and unbearably weighed down and crushed that we despaired even of life [ itself ] .
47001009	Indeed , we felt within ourselves that we had received the [ very ] sentence of death , but that was to keep us from trusting in and depending on ourselves instead of on God Who raises the dead .
47001010	[ For it is He ] Who rescued and saved us from such a perilous death , and He will still rescue and save us ; in and on Him we have set our hope ( our joyful and confident expectation ) that He will again deliver us [ from danger and destruction and draw us to Himself ] ,
47001011	While you also cooperate by your prayers for us [ helping and laboring together with us ] . Thus [ the lips of ] many persons [ turned toward God will eventually ] give thanks on our behalf for the grace ( the blessing of deliverance ) granted us at the request of the many who have prayed .
47001012	It is a reason for pride and exultation to which our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world [ generally ] and especially toward you , with devout and pure motives and godly sincerity , not in fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God ( the unmerited favor and merciful kindness by which God , exerting His holy influence upon souls , turns them to Christ , and keeps , strengthens , and increases them in Christian virtues ) .
47001013	For we write you nothing else but simply what you can read and understand [ there is no double meaning to what we say ] , and I hope that you will become thoroughly acquainted [ with divine things ] and know and understand [ them ] accurately and well to the end ,
47001014	[ Just ] as you have [ already ] partially known and understood and acknowledged us and recognized that you can [ honestly ] be proud of us , even as we [ can be proud ] of you on the day of our Lord Jesus .
47001015	It was with assurance of this that I wanted and planned to visit you first [ of all ] , so that you might have a double favor and token of grace ( goodwill ) .
47001016	[ I wanted ] to visit you on my way to Macedonia , and [ then ] to come again to you [ on my return trip ] from Macedonia and have you send me forward on my way to Judea .
47001017	Now because I changed my original plan , was I being unstable and capricious ? Or what I plan , do I plan according to the flesh [ like a worldly man ] , ready to say Yes , yes , [ when it may mean ] No , no ?
47001018	As surely as God is trustworthy and faithful and means what He says , our speech and message to you have not been Yes [ that might mean ] No .
47001019	For the Son of God , Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , Who has been preached among you by us , by myself , Silvanus , and Timothy , was not Yes and No ; but in Him it is [ always the divine ] Yes .
47001020	For as many as are the promises of God , they all find their Yes [ answer ] in Him [ Christ ] . For this reason we also utter the Amen ( so be it ) to God through Him [ in His Person and by His agency ] to the glory of God .
47001021	But it is God Who confirms and makes us steadfast and establishes us [ in joint fellowship ] with you in Christ , and has consecrated and anointed us [ enduing us with the gifts of the Holy Spirit ] ;
47001022	[ He has also appropriated and acknowledged us as His by ] putting His seal upon us and giving us His [ Holy ] Spirit in our hearts as the security deposit and guarantee [ of the fulfillment of His promise ] .
47001023	But I call upon God as my soul’s witness : it was to avoid hurting you that I refrained from coming to Corinth --
47001024	Not that we have dominion [ over you ] and lord it over your faith , but [ rather that we work with you as ] fellow laborers [ to promote ] your joy , for in [ your ] faith ( in your strong and welcome conviction or belief that Jesus is the Messiah , through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ) you stand firm .
47002001	BUT I definitely made up my mind not to grieve you with another painful and distressing visit .
47002002	For if I cause you pain [ with merited rebuke ] , who is there to provide me enjoyment but the [ very ] one whom I have grieved and made sad ?
47002003	And I wrote the same to you so that when I came , I might not be myself pained by those who are the [ very ] ones who ought to make me glad , for I trusted in you all and felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you .
47002004	For I wrote you out of great sorrow and deep distress [ with mental torture and anxiety ] of heart , [ yes , and ] with many tears , not to cause you pain but in order to make you realize the overflowing love that I continue increasingly to have for you .
47002005	But if someone [ the one among you who committed incest ] has caused [ all this ] grief and pain , he has caused it not to me , but in some measure , not to put it too severely , [ he has distressed ] all of you .
47002006	For such a one this censure by the majority [ which he has received is ] sufficient [ punishment ] .
47002007	So [ instead of further rebuke , now ] you should rather turn and [ graciously ] forgive and comfort and encourage [ him ] , to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow and despair .
47002008	I therefore beg you to reinstate him in your affections and assure him of your love for him ;
47002009	For this was my purpose in writing you , to test your attitude and see if you would stand the test , whether you are obedient and altogether agreeable [ to following my orders ] in everything .
47002010	If you forgive anyone anything , I too forgive that one ; and what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , has been for your sakes in the presence [ and with the approval ] of Christ ( the Messiah ) ,
47002011	To keep Satan from getting the advantage over us ; for we are not ignorant of his wiles and intentions .
47002012	Now when I arrived at Troas [ to preach ] the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ , a door of opportunity was opened for me in the Lord ,
47002013	Yet my spirit could not rest ( relax , get relief ) because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I took leave from them and departed for Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [ as trophies of Christ’s victory ] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere ,
47002015	For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ [ which exhales ] unto God , [ discernible alike ] among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing :
47002016	To the latter it is an aroma [ wafted ] from death to death [ a fatal odor , the smell of doom ] ; to the former it is an aroma from life to life [ a vital fragrance , living and fresh ] . And who is qualified ( fit and sufficient ) for these things ? [ Who is able for such a ministry ? We ? ]
47002017	For we are not , like so many , [ like hucksters making a trade of ] peddling God’s Word [ shortchanging and adulterating the divine message ] ; but like [ men ] of sincerity and the purest motive , as [ commissioned and sent ] by God , we speak [ His message ] in Christ ( the Messiah ) , in the [ very ] sight and presence of God .
47003001	ARE WE starting to commend ourselves again ? Or we do not , like some [ false teachers ] , need written credentials or letters of recommendation to you or from you , [ do we ] ?
47003002	[ No ] you yourselves are our letter of recommendation ( our credentials ) , written in your hearts , to be known ( perceived , recognized ) and read by everybody .
47003003	You show and make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us , not written with ink but with [ the ] Spirit of [ the ] living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
47003004	Such is the reliance and confidence that we have through Christ toward and with reference to God .
47003005	Not that we are fit ( qualified and sufficient in ability ) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us , but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God .
47003006	[ It is He ] Who has qualified us [ making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient ] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [ of salvation through Christ ] , not [ ministers ] of the letter ( of legally written code ) but of the Spirit ; for the code [ of the Law ] kills , but the [ Holy ] Spirit makes alive .
47003007	Now if the dispensation of death engraved in letters on stone [ the ministration of the Law ] , was inaugurated with such glory and splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its brilliance , [ a glory ] that was to fade and pass away ,
47003008	Why should not the dispensation of the Spirit [ this spiritual ministry whose task it is to cause men to obtain and be governed by the Holy Spirit ] be attended with much greater and more splendid glory ?
47003009	For if the service that condemns [ the ministration of doom ] had glory , how infinitely more abounding in splendor and glory must be the service that makes righteous [ the ministry that produces and fosters righteous living and right standing with God ] !
47003010	Indeed , in view of this fact , what once had splendor [ the glory of the Law in the face of Moses ] has come to have no splendor at all , because of the overwhelming glory that exceeds and excels it [ the glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ ] .
47003011	For if that which was but passing and fading away came with splendor , how much more must that which remains and is permanent abide in glory and splendor !
47003012	Since we have such [ glorious ] hope ( such joyful and confident expectation ) , we speak very freely and openly and fearlessly .
47003013	Nor [ do we act ] like Moses , who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze upon the finish of the vanishing [ splendor which had been upon it ] .
47003014	In fact , their minds were grown hard and calloused [ they had become dull and had lost the power of understanding ] ; for until this present day , when the Old Testament ( the old covenant ) is being read , that same veil still lies [ on their hearts ] , not being lifted [ to reveal ] that in Christ it is made void and done away .
47003015	Yes , down to this [ very ] day whenever Moses is read , a veil lies upon their minds and hearts .
47003016	But whenever a person turns [ in repentance ] to the Lord , the veil is stripped off and taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty ( emancipation from bondage , freedom ) .
47003018	And all of us , as with unveiled face , [ because we ] continued to behold [ in the Word of God ] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another ; [ for this comes ] from the Lord [ Who is ] the Spirit .
47004001	THEREFORE , SINCE we do hold and engage in this ministry by the mercy of God [ granting us favor , benefits , opportunities , and especially salvation ] , we do not get discouraged ( spiritless and despondent with fear ) or become faint with weariness and exhaustion .
47004002	We have renounced disgraceful ways ( secret thoughts , feelings , desires and underhandedness , the methods and arts that men hide through shame ) ; we refuse to deal craftily ( to practice trickery and cunning ) or to adulterate or handle dishonestly the Word of God , but we state the truth openly ( clearly and candidly ) . And so we commend ourselves in the sight and presence of God to every man’s conscience .
47004003	But even if our Gospel ( the glad tidings ) also be hidden ( obscured and covered up with a veil that hinders the knowledge of God ) , it is hidden [ only ] to those who are perishing and obscured [ only ] to those who are spiritually dying and veiled [ only ] to those who are lost .
47004004	For the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers’ minds [ that they should not discern the truth ] , preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ ( the Messiah ) , Who is the Image and Likeness of God .
47004005	For what we preach is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves [ merely ] as your servants ( slaves ) for Jesus’ sake .
47004006	For God Who said , Let light shine out of darkness , has shone in our hearts so as [ to beam forth ] the Light for the illumination of the knowledge of the majesty and glory of God [ as it is manifest in the Person and is revealed ] in the face of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
47004007	However , we possess this precious treasure [ the divine Light of the Gospel ] in [ frail , human ] vessels of earth , that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from God and not from ourselves .
47004008	We are hedged in ( pressed ) on every side [ troubled and oppressed in every way ] , but not cramped or crushed ; we suffer embarrassments and are perplexed and unable to find a way out , but not driven to despair ;
47004009	We are pursued ( persecuted and hard driven ) , but not deserted [ to stand alone ] ; we are struck down to the ground , but never struck out and destroyed ;
47004010	Always carrying about in the body the liability and exposure to the same putting to death that the Lord Jesus suffered , so that the [ resurrection ] life of Jesus also may be shown forth by and in our bodies .
47004011	For we who live are constantly [ experiencing ] being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake , that the [ resurrection ] life of Jesus also may be evidenced through our flesh which is liable to death .
47004012	Thus death is actively at work in us , but [ it is in order that our ] life [ may be actively at work ] in you .
47004013	Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote , I have believed , and therefore have I spoken . We too believe , and therefore we speak ,
47004014	Assured that He Who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and bring us [ along ] with you into His presence .
47004015	For all [ these ] things are [ taking place ] for your sake , so that the more grace ( divine favor and spiritual blessing ) extends to more and more people and multiplies through the many , the more thanksgiving may increase [ and redound ] to the glory of God .
47004016	Therefore we do not become discouraged ( utterly spiritless , exhausted , and wearied out through fear ) . Though our outer man is [ progressively ] decaying and wasting away , yet our inner self is being [ progressively ] renewed day after day .
47004017	For our light , momentary affliction ( this slight distress of the passing hour ) is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory [ beyond all measure , excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations , a vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease ! ] ,
47004018	Since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen ; for the things that are visible are temporal ( brief and fleeting ) , but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting .
47005001	FOR WE know that if the tent which is our earthly home is destroyed ( dissolved ) , we have from God a building , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
47005002	Here indeed , in this [ present abode , body ] , we sigh and groan inwardly , because we yearn to be clothed over [ we yearn to put on our celestial body like a garment , to be fitted out ] with our heavenly dwelling ,
47005003	So that by putting it on we may not be found naked ( without a body ) .
47005004	For while we are still in this tent , we groan under the burden and sigh deeply ( weighed down , depressed , oppressed ) -- not that we want to put off the body ( the clothing of the spirit ) , but rather that we would be further clothed , so that what is mortal ( our dying body ) may be swallowed up by life [ after the resurrection ] .
47005005	Now He Who has fashioned us [ preparing and making us fit ] for this very thing is God , Who also has given us the [ Holy ] Spirit as a guarantee [ of the fulfillment of His promise ] .
47005006	So then , we are always full of good and hopeful and confident courage ; we know that while we are at home in the body , we are abroad from the home with the Lord [ that is promised us ] .
47005007	For we walk by faith [ we regulate our lives and conduct ourselves by our conviction or belief respecting man’s relationship to God and divine things , with trust and holy fervor ; thus we walk ] not by sight or appearance .
47005008	[ Yes ] we have confident and hopeful courage and are pleased rather to be away from home out of the body and be at home with the Lord .
47005009	Therefore , whether we are at home [ on earth away from Him ] or away from home [ and with Him ] , we are constantly ambitious and strive earnestly to be pleasing to Him .
47005010	For we must all appear and be revealed as we are before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive [ his pay ] according to what he has done in the body , whether good or evil [ considering what his purpose and motive have been , and what he has achieved , been busy with , and given himself and his attention to accomplishing ] .
47005011	Therefore , being conscious of fearing the Lord with respect and reverence , we seek to win people over [ to persuade them ] . But what sort of persons we are is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood by God , and I hope that it is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood also by your consciences ( your inborn discernment ) .
47005012	We are not commending ourselves to you again , but we are providing you with an occasion and incentive to be [ rightfully ] proud of us , so that you may have a reply for those who pride themselves on surface appearances [ on the virtues they only appear to have ] , although their heart is devoid of them .
47005013	For if we are beside ourselves [ mad , as some say ] , it is for God and concerns Him ; if we are in our right mind , it is for your benefit ,
47005014	For the love of Christ controls and urges and impels us , because we are of the opinion and conviction that [ if ] One died for all , then all died ;
47005015	And He died for all , so that all those who live might live no longer to and for themselves , but to and for Him Who died and was raised again for their sake .
47005016	Consequently , from now on we estimate and regard no one from a [ purely ] human point of view [ in terms of natural standards of value ] . [ No ] even though we once did estimate Christ from a human viewpoint and as a man , yet now [ we have such knowledge of Him that ] we know Him no longer [ in terms of the flesh ] .
47005017	Therefore if any person is [ ingrafted ] in Christ ( the Messiah ) he is a new creation ( a new creature altogether ) ; the old [ previous moral and spiritual condition ] has passed away . Behold , the fresh and new has come !
47005018	But all things are from God , Who through Jesus Christ reconciled us to Himself [ received us into favor , brought us into harmony with Himself ] and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation [ that by word and deed we might aim to bring others into harmony with Him ] .
47005019	It was God [ personally present ] in Christ , reconciling and restoring the world to favor with Himself , not counting up and holding against [ men ] their trespasses [ but cancelling them ] , and committing to us the message of reconciliation ( of the restoration to favor ) .
47005020	So we are Christ’s ambassadors , God making His appeal as it were through us . We [ as Christ’s personal representatives ] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [ now offered you ] and be reconciled to God .
47005021	For our sake He made Christ [ virtually ] to be sin Who knew no sin , so that in and through Him we might become [ endued with , viewed as being in , and examples of ] the righteousness of God [ what we ought to be , approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him , by His goodness ] .
47006001	LABORING TOGETHER [ as God’s fellow workers ] with Him then , we beg of you not to receive the grace of God in vain [ that merciful kindness by which God exerts His holy influence on souls and turns them to Christ , keeping and strengthening them -- do not receive it to no purpose ] .
47006002	For He says , In the time of favor ( of an assured welcome ) I have listened to and heeded your call , and I have helped you on the day of deliverance ( the day of salvation ) . Behold , now is truly the time for a gracious welcome and acceptance [ of you from God ] ; behold , now is the day of salvation !
47006003	We put no obstruction in anybody’s way [ we give no offense in anything ] , so that no fault may be found and [ our ] ministry blamed and discredited .
47006004	But we commend ourselves in every way as [ true ] servants of God : through great endurance , in tribulation and suffering , in hardships and privations , in sore straits and calamities ,
47006005	In beatings , imprisonments , riots , labors , sleepless watching , hunger ;
47006006	By innocence and purity , knowledge and spiritual insight , longsuffering and patience , kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in unfeigned love ;
47006007	By [ speaking ] the word of truth , in the power of God , with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [ to attack ] and for the left hand [ to defend ] ;
47006008	Amid honor and dishonor ; in defaming and evil report and in praise and good report . [ We are branded ] as deceivers ( impostors ) , and [ yet vindicated as ] truthful and honest .
47006009	[ We are treated ] as unknown and ignored [ by the world ] , and [ yet we are ] well-known and recognized [ by God and His people ] ; as dying , and yet here we are alive ; as chastened by suffering and [ yet ] not killed ;
47006010	As grieved and mourning , yet [ we are ] always rejoicing ; as poor [ ourselves , yet ] bestowing riches on many ; as having nothing , and [ yet in reality ] possessing all things .
47006011	Our mouth is open to you , Corinthians [ we are hiding nothing , keeping nothing back ] , and our heart is expanded wide [ for you ] !
47006012	There is no lack of room for you in [ our hearts ] , but you lack room in your own affections [ for us ] .
47006013	By way of return then , do this for me -- I speak as to children -- open wide your hearts also [ to us ] .
47006014	Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers [ do not make mismated alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them , inconsistent with your faith ] . For what partnership have right living and right standing with God with iniquity and lawlessness ? Or how can light have fellowship with darkness ?
47006015	What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial [ the devil ] ? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	What agreement [ can there be between ] a temple of God and idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ; even as God said , I will dwell in and with and among them and will walk in and with and among them , and I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
47006017	So , come out from among [ unbelievers ] , and separate ( sever ) yourselves from them , says the Lord , and touch not [ any ] unclean thing ; then I will receive you kindly and treat you with favor ,
47006018	And I will be a Father to you , and you shall be My sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty .
47007001	THEREFORE , SINCE these [ great ] promises are ours , beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates and defiles body and spirit , and bring [ our ] consecration to completeness in the [ reverential ] fear of God .
47007002	Do open your hearts to us again [ enlarge them to take us in ] . We have wronged no one , we have betrayed or corrupted no one , we have cheated or taken advantage of no one .
47007003	I do not say this to reproach or condemn [ you ] , for I have said before that you are [ nested ] in our hearts , [ and you will remain there ] together [ with us ] , whether we die or live .
47007004	I have great boldness and free and fearless confidence and cheerful courage toward you ; my pride in you is great . I am filled [ brimful ] with the comfort [ of it ] ; with all our tribulation and in spite of it , [ I am filled with comfort ] I am overflowing with joy .
47007005	For even when we arrived in Macedonia , our bodies had no ease or rest , but we were oppressed in every way and afflicted at every turn -- fighting and contentions without , dread and fears within [ us ] .
47007006	But God , Who comforts and encourages and refreshes and cheers the depressed and the sinking , comforted and encouraged and refreshed and cheered us by the arrival of Titus .
47007007	[ Yes ] and not only by his coming but also by [ his account of ] the comfort with which he was encouraged and refreshed and cheered as to you , while he told us of your yearning affection , of how sorry you were [ for me ] and how eagerly you took my part , so that I rejoiced still more .
47007008	For even though I did grieve you with my letter , I do not regret [ it now ] , though I did regret it ; for I see that that letter did pain you , though only for a little while ;
47007009	Yet I am glad now , not because you were pained , but because you were pained into repentance [ and so turned back to God ] ; for you felt a grief such as God meant you to feel , so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us or harm for what we did .
47007010	For godly grief and the pain God is permitted to direct , produce a repentance that leads and contributes to salvation and deliverance from evil , and it never brings regret ; but worldly grief ( the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world ) is deadly [ breeding and ending in death ] .
47007011	For [ you can look back now and ] observe what this same godly sorrow has done for you and has produced in you : what eagerness and earnest care to explain and clear yourselves [ of all complicity in the condoning of incest ] , what indignation [ at the sin ] , what alarm , what yearning , what zeal [ to do justice to all concerned ] , what readiness to mete out punishment [ to the offender ] ! At every point you have proved yourselves cleared and guiltless in the matter . [ I Cor . 5 . ]
47007012	So although I did write to you [ as I did ] , it was not for the sake and because of the one who did [ the ] wrong , nor on account of the one who suffered [ the ] wrong , but in order that you might realize before God [ that your readiness to accept our authority revealed ] how zealously you do care for us .
47007013	Therefore we are relieved and comforted and encouraged [ at the result ] . And in addition to our own [ personal ] consolation , we were especially delighted at the joy of Titus , because you have all set his mind at rest , soothing and refreshing his spirit .
47007014	For if I had boasted to him at all concerning you , I was not disappointed or put to shame , but just as everything we ever said to you was true , so our boasting [ about you ] to Titus has proved true also .
47007015	And his heart goes out to you more abundantly than ever as he recalls the submission [ to his guidance ] that all of you had , and the reverence and anxiety [ to meet all requirements ] with which you accepted and welcomed him .
47007016	I am very happy because I now am of good courage and have perfect confidence in you in all things .
47008001	WE WANT to tell you further , brethren , about the grace ( the favor and spiritual blessing ) of God which has been evident in the churches of Macedonia [ arousing in them the desire to give alms ] ;
47008002	For in the midst of an ordeal of severe tribulation , their abundance of joy and their depth of poverty [ together ] have overflowed in wealth of lavish generosity on their part .
47008003	For , as I can bear witness , [ they gave ] according to their ability , yes , and beyond their ability ; and [ they did it ] voluntarily ,
47008004	Begging us most insistently for the favor and the fellowship of contributing in this ministration for [ the relief and support of ] the saints [ in Jerusalem ] .
47008005	Nor [ was this gift of theirs merely the contribution ] that we expected , but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us [ as His agents ] by the will of God [ entirely disregarding their personal interests , they gave as much as they possibly could , having put themselves at our disposal to be directed by the will of God ] --
47008006	So much so that we have urged Titus that as he began it , he should also complete this beneficent and gracious contribution among you [ the church at Corinth ] .
47008007	Now as you abound and excel and are at the front in everything -- in faith , in expressing yourselves , in knowledge , in all zeal , and in your love for us -- [ see to it that you come to the front now and ] abound and excel in this gracious work [ of almsgiving ] also .
47008008	I give this not as an order [ to dictate to you ] , but to prove , by [ pointing out ] the zeal of others , the sincerity of your [ own ] love also .
47008009	For you are becoming progressively acquainted with and recognizing more strongly and clearly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ( His kindness , His gracious generosity , His undeserved favor and spiritual blessing ) , [ in ] that though He was [ so very ] rich , yet for your sakes He became [ so very ] poor , in order that by His poverty you might become enriched ( abundantly supplied ) .
47008010	[ It is then ] my counsel and my opinion in this matter that I give [ you when I say ] : It is profitable and fitting for you [ now to complete the enterprise ] which more than a year ago you not only began , but were the first to wish to do anything [ about contributions for the relief of the saints at Jerusalem ] .
47008011	So now finish doing it , that your [ enthusiastic ] readiness in desiring it may be equalled by your completion of it according to your ability and means .
47008012	For if the [ eager ] readiness to give is there , then it is acceptable and welcomed in proportion to what a person has , not according to what he does not have .
47008013	For it is not [ intended ] that other people be eased and relieved [ of their responsibility ] and you be burdened and suffer [ unfairly ] ,
47008014	But to have equality [ share and share alike ] , your surplus over necessity at the present time going to meet their want and to equalize the difference created by it , so that [ at some other time ] their surplus in turn may be given to supply your want . Thus there may be equality ,
47008015	As it is written , He who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little did not lack .
47008016	But thanks be to God Who planted the same earnest zeal and care for you in the heart of Titus .
47008017	For he not only welcomed and responded to our appeal , but was himself so keen in his enthusiasm and interest in you that he is going to you of his own accord .
47008018	But we are sending along with him that brother [ Luke ? ] whose praise in the Gospel ministry [ is spread ] throughout all the churches ;
47008019	And more than that , he has been appointed by the churches to travel as our companion in regard to this bountiful contribution which we are administering for the glory of the Lord Himself and [ to show ] our eager readiness [ as Christians to help one another ] .
47008020	[ For ] we are on our guard , intending that no one should find anything for which to blame us in regard to our administration of this large contribution .
47008021	For we take thought beforehand and aim to be honest and absolutely above suspicion , not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men .
47008022	Moreover , along with them we are sending our brother , whom we have often put to the test and have found him zealous ( devoted and earnest ) in many matters , but who is now more [ eagerly ] earnest than ever because of [ his ] absolute confidence in you .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my colleague and shares my work in your service ; and as for the [ other two ] brethren , they are the [ special ] messengers of the churches , a credit and glory to Christ ( the Messiah ) .
47008024	Show to these men , therefore , in the sight of the churches , the reality and plain truth of your love ( your affection , goodwill , and benevolence ) and what [ good reasons ] I had for boasting about and being proud of you .
47009001	NOW ABOUT the offering that is [ to be made ] for the saints ( God’s people in Jerusalem ) , it is quite superfluous that I should write you ;
47009002	For I am well acquainted with your willingness ( your readiness and your eagerness to promote it ) and I have proudly told about you to the people of Macedonia , saying that Achaia ( most of Greece ) has been prepared since last year for this contribution ; and [ consequently ] your enthusiasm has stimulated the majority of them .
47009003	Still , I am sending the brethren [ on to you ] , lest our pride in you should be made an empty boast in this particular case , and so that you may be all ready , as I told them you would be ;
47009004	Lest , if [ any ] Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared [ for this generosity ] , we , to say nothing of yourselves , be humiliated for our being so confident .
47009005	That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brethren to go to you before I do and make arrangements in advance for this bountiful , promised gift of yours , so that it may be ready , not as an extortion [ wrung out of you ] but as a generous and willing gift .
47009006	[ Remember ] this : he who sows sparingly and grudgingly will also reap sparingly and grudgingly , and he who sows generously [ that blessings may come to someone ] will also reap generously and with blessings .
47009007	Let each one [ give ] as he has made up his own mind and purposed in his heart , not reluctantly or sorrowfully or under compulsion , for God loves ( He takes pleasure in , prizes above other things , and is unwilling to abandon or to do without ) a cheerful ( joyous , “ prompt to do it ” ) giver [ whose heart is in his giving ] .
47009008	And God is able to make all grace ( every favor and earthly blessing ) come to you in abundance , so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [ possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation ] .
47009009	As it is written , He [ the benevolent person ] scatters abroad ; He gives to the poor ; His deeds of justice and goodness and kindness and benevolence will go on and endure forever !
47009010	And [ God ] Who provides seed for the sower and bread for eating will also provide and multiply your [ resources for ] sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness [ which manifests itself in active goodness , kindness , and charity ] .
47009011	Thus you will be enriched in all things and in every way , so that you can be generous , and [ your generosity as it is ] administered by us will bring forth thanksgiving to God .
47009012	For the service that the ministering of this fund renders does not only fully supply what is lacking to the saints ( God’s people ) , but it also overflows in many [ cries of ] thanksgiving to God .
47009013	Because at [ your ] standing of the test of this ministry , they will glorify God for your loyalty and obedience to the Gospel of Christ which you confess , as well as for your generous-hearted liberality to them and to all [ the other needy ones ] .
47009014	And they yearn for you while they pray for you , because of the surpassing measure of God’s grace ( His favor and mercy and spiritual blessing which is shown forth ) in you .
47009015	Now thanks be to God for His Gift , [ precious ] beyond telling [ His indescribable , inexpressible , free Gift ] !
47010001	NOW I myself , Paul , beseech you , by the gentleness and consideration of Christ [ Himself ; I ] who [ am ] lowly enough [ so they say ] when among you face to face , but bold ( fearless and outspoken ) to you when [ I am ] absent from you !
47010002	I entreat you when I do come [ to you ] that I may not [ be driven to such ] boldness as I intend to show toward those few who suspect us of acting according to the flesh [ on the low level of worldly motives and as if invested with only human powers ] .
47010003	For though we walk ( live ) in the flesh , we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons .
47010004	For the weapons of our warfare are not physical [ weapons of flesh and blood ] , but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds ,
47010005	[ Inasmuch as we ] refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the [ true ] knowledge of God ; and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) ,
47010006	Being in readiness to punish every [ insubordinate for his ] disobedience , when your own submission and obedience [ as a church ] are fully secured and complete .
47010007	Look at [ this obvious fact ] which is before your eyes . If anyone is confident that he is Christ’s , let him reflect and remind himself that even as he is Christ’s , so too are we .
47010008	For even though I boast rather freely about our power and authority , which the Lord gave for your upbuilding and not for demolishing you , yet I shall not be put to shame [ for exceeding the truth ] ,
47010009	Neither would I seem to be overawing or frightening you with my letters ;
47010010	For they say , His letters are weighty and impressive and forceful and telling , but his personality and bodily presence are weak , and his speech and delivery are utterly contemptible ( of no account ) .
47010011	Let such people realize that what we say by letters when we are absent , [ we put ] also into deeds when we are present --
47010012	Not that we [ have the audacity to ] venture to class or [ even to ] compare ourselves with some who exalt and furnish testimonials for themselves ! However , when they measure themselves with themselves and compare themselves with one another , they are without understanding and behave unwisely .
47010013	We , on the other hand , will not boast beyond our legitimate province and proper limit , but will keep within the limits [ of our commission which ] God has allotted us as our measuring line and which reaches and includes even you .
47010014	For we are not overstepping the limits of our province and stretching beyond our ability to reach , as though we reached not ( had no legitimate mission ) to you , for we were [ the very first ] to come even as far as to you with the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ .
47010015	We do not boast therefore , beyond our proper limit , over other men’s labors , but we have the hope and confident expectation that as your faith continues to grow , our field among you may be greatly enlarged , still within the limits of our commission ,
47010016	So that [ we may even ] preach the Gospel in lands [ lying ] beyond you , without making a boast of work already done in another [ man’s ] sphere of activity [ before we came on the scene ] .
47010017	However , let him who boasts and glories boast and glory in the Lord .
47010018	For [ it is ] not [ the man ] who praises and commends himself who is approved and accepted , but [ it is the person ] whom the Lord accredits and commends .
47011001	I WISH you would bear with me while I indulge in a little [ so-called ] foolishness . Do bear with me !
47011002	For I am zealous for you with a godly eagerness and a divine jealousy , for I have betrothed you to one Husband , to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
47011003	But [ now ] I am fearful , lest that even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning , so your minds may be corrupted and seduced from wholehearted and sincere and pure devotion to Christ .
47011004	For [ you seem readily to endure it ] if a man comes and preaches another Jesus than the One we preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the [ Spirit ] you [ once ] received or a different gospel from the one you [ then ] received and welcomed ; you tolerate [ all that ] well enough !
47011005	Yet I consider myself as in no way inferior to these [ precious ] extra-super [ false ] apostles .
47011006	But even if [ I am ] unskilled in speaking , yet [ I am ] not [ unskilled ] in knowledge [ I know what I am talking about ] ; we have made this evident to you in all things .
47011007	But did I perhaps make a mistake and do you a wrong in debasing and cheapening myself so that you might be exalted and enriched in dignity and honor and happiness by preaching God’s Gospel without expense to you ?
47011008	Other churches I have robbed by accepting [ more than their share of ] support for my ministry [ from them in order ] to serve you .
47011009	And when I was with you and ran short financially , I did not burden any [ of you ] , for what I lacked was abundantly made up by the brethren who came from Macedonia . So I kept myself from being burdensome to you in any way , and will continue to keep [ myself from being so ] .
47011010	As the truth of Christ is in me , this my boast [ of independence ] shall not be debarred ( silenced or checked ) in the regions of Achaia ( most of Greece ) .
47011011	And why ? Because I do not love you [ do not have a preference for you , wish you well , and regard your welfare ] ? God perceives and knows that I do !
47011012	But what I do , I will continue to do , [ for I am determined to maintain this independence ] in order to cut off the claim of those who would like [ to find an occasion and incentive ] to claim that in their boasted [ mission ] they work on the same terms that we do .
47011013	For such men are false apostles [ spurious , counterfeits ] , deceitful workmen , masquerading as apostles ( special messengers ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
47011014	And it is no wonder , for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light ;
47011015	So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as ministers of righteousness . [ But ] their end will correspond with their deeds .
47011016	I repeat then , let no one think I have lost my wits ; but even if you do , then bear with a witless man , so that I too may boast a little .
47011017	What I say by way of this confident boasting , I say not with the Lord’s authority [ by inspiration ] but , as it were , in pure witlessness .
47011018	[ For ] since many boast of worldly things and according to the flesh , I will glory ( boast ) also .
47011019	For you readily and gladly bear with the foolish , since you are so smart and wise yourselves !
47011020	For you endure it if a man assumes control of your souls and makes slaves of you , or devours [ your substance , spends your money ] and preys upon you , or deceives and takes advantage of you , or is arrogant and puts on airs , or strikes you in the face .
47011021	To my discredit , I must say , we have shown ourselves too weak [ for you to show such tolerance of us and for us to do strong , courageous things like that to you ] ! But in whatever any person is bold and dares [ to boast ] -- mind you , I am speaking in this foolish ( witless ) way -- I also am bold and dare [ to boast ] .
47011022	They are Hebrews ? So am I ! They are Israelites ? So am I ! They are descendants of Abraham ? So am I !
47011023	Are they [ ministering ] servants of Christ ( the Messiah ) ? I am talking like one beside himself , [ but ] I am more , with far more extensive and abundant labors , with far more imprisonments , [ beaten ] with countless stripes , and frequently [ at the point of ] death .
47011024	Five times I received from [ the hands of ] the Jews forty [ lashes all ] but one ;
47011025	Three times I have been beaten with rods ; once I was stoned . Three times I have been aboard a ship wrecked at sea ; a [ whole ] night and a day I have spent [ adrift ] on the deep ;
47011026	Many times on journeys , [ exposed to ] perils from rivers , perils from bandits , perils from [ my own ] nation , perils from the Gentiles , perils in the city , perils in the desert places , perils in the sea , perils from those posing as believers [ but destitute of Christian knowledge and piety ] ;
47011027	In toil and hardship , watching often [ through sleepless nights ] , in hunger and thirst , frequently driven to fasting by want , in cold and exposure and lack of clothing .
47011028	And besides those things that are without , there is the daily [ inescapable pressure ] of my care and anxiety for all the churches !
47011029	Who is weak , and I do not feel [ his ] weakness ? Who is made to stumble and fall and have his faith hurt , and I am not on fire [ with sorrow or indignation ] ?
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast of the things that [ show ] my infirmity [ of the things by which I am made weak and contemptible in the eyes of my opponents ] .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ knows , He Who is blessed and to be praised forevermore , that I do not lie .
47011032	In Damascus , the city governor acting under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus [ on purpose ] to arrest me ,
47011033	And I was [ actually ] let down in a [ rope ] basket or hamper through a window ( a small door ) in the wall , and I escaped through his fingers .
47012001	TRUE , THERE is nothing to be gained by it , but [ as I am obliged ] to boast , I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago -- whether in the body or out of the body I do not know , God knows -- was caught up to the third heaven .
47012003	And I know that this man -- whether in the body or away from the body I do not know , God knows --
47012004	Was caught up into paradise , and he heard utterances beyond the power of man to put into words , which man is not permitted to utter .
47012005	Of this same [ man’s experiences ] I will boast , but of myself ( personally ) I will not boast , except as regards my infirmities ( my weaknesses ) .
47012006	Should I desire to boast , I shall not be a witless braggart , for I shall be speaking the truth . But I abstain [ from it ] so that no one may form a higher estimate of me than [ is justified by ] what he sees in me or hears from me .
47012007	And to keep me from being puffed up and too much elated by the exceeding greatness ( preeminence ) of these revelations , there was given me a thorn ( a splinter ) in the flesh , a messenger of Satan , to rack and buffet and harass me , to keep me from being excessively exalted .
47012008	Three times I called upon the Lord and besought [ Him ] about this and begged that it might depart from me ;
47012009	But He said to me , My grace ( My favor and loving-kindness and mercy ) is enough for you [ sufficient against any danger and enables you to bear the trouble manfully ] ; for My strength and power are made perfect ( fulfilled and completed ) and show themselves most effective in [ your ] weakness . Therefore , I will all the more gladly glory in my weaknesses and infirmities , that the strength and power of Christ ( the Messiah ) may rest ( yes , may pitch a tent over and dwell ) upon me !
47012010	So for the sake of Christ , I am well pleased and take pleasure in infirmities , insults , hardships , persecutions , perplexities and distresses ; for when I am weak [ in human strength ] , then am I [ truly ] strong ( able , powerful in divine strength ) .
47012011	Now I have been [ speaking like ] a fool ! But you forced me to it , for I ought to have been [ saved the necessity and ] commended by you . For I have not fallen short one bit or proved myself at all inferior to those superlative [ false ] apostles [ of yours ] , even if I am nothing ( a nobody ) .
47012012	Indeed , the signs that indicate a [ genuine ] apostle were performed among you fully and most patiently in miracles and wonders and mighty works .
47012013	For in what respect were you put to a disadvantage in comparison with the rest of the churches , unless [ it was for the fact ] that I myself did not burden you [ with my financial support ] ? Pardon me [ for doing you ] this injustice !
47012014	Now for the third time I am ready to come to [ visit ] you . And I will not burden you [ financially ] , for it is not your [ money ] that I want but you ; for children are not duty bound to lay up store for their parents , but parents for their children .
47012015	But I will most gladly spend [ myself ] and be utterly spent for your souls . If I love you exceedingly , am I to be loved [ by you ] the less ?
47012016	But though granting that I did not burden you [ with my support , some say that ] I was crafty [ and that ] I cheated and got the better of you with my trickery .
47012017	Did I [ then ] take advantage of you or make any money out of you through any of those [ messengers ] whom I sent to you ?
47012018	[ Actually ] I urged Titus [ to go ] , and I sent the brother with [ him ] . Did Titus overreach or take advantage of you [ in anything ] ? Did he and I not act in the same spirit ? Did we not [ take the ] same steps ?
47012019	Have you been supposing [ all this time ] that we have been defending ourselves and apologizing to you ? [ It is ] in the sight and the [ very ] presence of God [ and as one ] in Christ ( the Messiah ) that we have been speaking , dearly beloved , and all in order to build you up [ spiritually ] .
47012020	For I am fearful that somehow or other I may come and find you not as I desire to find you , and that you may find me too not as you want to find me -- that perhaps there may be factions ( quarreling ) , jealousy , temper ( wrath , intrigues , rivalry , divided loyalties ) , selfishness , whispering , gossip , arrogance ( self-assertion ) , and disorder among you .
47012021	[ I am fearful ] that when I come again , my God may humiliate and humble me in your regard , and that I may have to sorrow over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity , sexual vice , and sensuality which they formerly practiced .
47013001	THIS IS the third time that I am coming to you . By the testimony of two or three witnesses must any charge and every accusing statement be sustained and confirmed .
47013002	I have already warned those who sinned formerly and all the rest also , and I warn them now again while I am absent , as I did when present on my second visit , that if I come back , I will not spare [ them ] ,
47013003	Since you desire and seek [ perceptible ] proof of the Christ Who speaks in and through me . [ For He ] is not weak and feeble in dealing with you , but is a mighty power within you ;
47013004	For though He was crucified in weakness , yet He goes on living by the power of God . And though we too are weak in Him [ as He was humanly weak ] , yet in dealing with you [ we shall show ourselves ] alive and strong in [ fellowship with ] Him by the power of God .
47013005	Examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you are holding to your faith and showing the proper fruits of it . Test and prove yourselves [ not Christ ] . Do you not yourselves realize and know [ thoroughly by an ever-increasing experience ] that Jesus Christ is in you -- unless you are [ counterfeits ] disapproved on trial and rejected ?
47013006	But I hope you will recognize and know that we are not disapproved on trial and rejected .
47013007	But I pray to God that you may do nothing wrong , not in order that we [ our teaching ] may appear to be approved , but that you may continue doing right , [ though ] we may seem to have failed and be unapproved .
47013008	For we can do nothing against the Truth [ not serve any party or personal interest ] , but only for the Truth [ which is the Gospel ] .
47013009	For we are glad when we are weak ( unapproved ) and you are really strong . And this we also pray for : your all-round strengthening and perfecting of soul .
47013010	So I write these things while I am absent from you , that when I come to you , I may not have to deal sharply in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me [ to be employed , however ] for building [ you ] up and not for tearing [ you ] down .
47013011	Finally , brethren , farewell ( rejoice ) ! Be strengthened ( perfected , completed , made what you ought to be ) ; be encouraged and consoled and comforted ; be of the same [ agreeable ] mind one with another ; live in peace , and [ then ] the God of love [ Who is the Source of affection , goodwill , love , and benevolence toward men ] and the Author and Promoter of peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a consecrated kiss .
47013013	All the saints ( the people of God here ) salute you .
47013014	The grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the presence and fellowship ( the communion and sharing together , and participation ) in the Holy Spirit be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) .
48001001	PAUL , AN apostle -- [ special messenger appointed and commissioned and sent out ] not from [ any body of ] men nor by or through any man , but by and through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and God the Father , Who raised Him from among the dead --
48001002	And all the brethren who are with me , to the churches of Galatia :
48001003	Grace and spiritual blessing be to you and [ soul ] peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) ,
48001004	Who gave ( yielded ) Himself up [ to atone ] for our sins [ and to save and sanctify us ] , in order to rescue and deliver us from this present wicked age and world order , in accordance with the will and purpose and plan of our God and Father --
48001005	To Him [ be ascribed all ] the glory through all the ages of the ages and the eternities of the eternities ! Amen ( so be it ) .
48001006	I am surprised and astonished that you are so quickly turning renegade and deserting Him Who invited and called you by the grace ( unmerited favor ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) [ and that you are transferring your allegiance ] to a different [ even an opposition ] gospel .
48001007	Not that there is [ or could be ] any other [ genuine Gospel ] , but there are [ obviously ] some who are troubling and disturbing and bewildering you [ with a different kind of teaching which they offer as a gospel ] and want to pervert and distort the Gospel of Christ ( the Messiah ) [ into something which it absolutely is not ] .
48001008	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to and different from that which we preached to you , let him be accursed ( anathema , devoted to destruction , doomed to eternal punishment ) !
48001009	As we said before , so I now say again : If anyone is preaching to you a gospel different from or contrary to that which you received [ from us ] , let him be accursed ( anathema , devoted to destruction , doomed to eternal punishment ) !
48001010	Now am I trying to win the favor of men , or of God ? Do I seek to please men ? If I were still seeking popularity with men , I should not be a bond servant of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
48001011	For I want you to know , brethren , that the Gospel which was proclaimed and made known by me is not man’s gospel [ a human invention , according to or patterned after any human standard ] .
48001012	For indeed I did not receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but [ it came to me ] through a [ direct ] revelation [ given ] by Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
48001013	You have heard of my earlier career and former manner of life in the Jewish religion ( Judaism ) , how I persecuted and abused the church of God furiously and extensively , and [ with fanatical zeal did my best ] to make havoc of it and destroy it .
48001014	And [ you have heard how ] I outstripped many of the men of my own generation among the people of my race in [ my advancement in study and observance of the laws of ] Judaism , so extremely enthusiastic and zealous I was for the traditions of my ancestors .
48001015	But when He , Who had chosen and set me apart [ even ] before I was born and had called me by His grace ( His undeserved favor and blessing ) , saw fit and was pleased
48001016	To reveal ( unveil , disclose ) His Son within me so that I might proclaim Him among the Gentiles ( the non-Jewish world ) as the glad tidings ( Gospel ) , immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood [ did not consult or counsel with any frail human being or communicate with anyone ] .
48001017	Nor did I [ even ] go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles ( special messengers of Christ ) before I was , but I went away and retired into Arabia , and afterward I came back again to Damascus .
48001018	Then three years later , I did go up to Jerusalem to become [ personally ] acquainted with Cephas ( Peter ) , and remained with him for fifteen days .
48001019	But I did not see any of the other apostles ( the special messengers of Christ ) except James the brother of our Lord .
48001020	Now [ note carefully what I am telling you , for it is the truth ] , I write this as if I were standing before the bar of God ; I do not lie .
48001021	Then I went into the districts ( countries , regions ) of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	And so far I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea ( the country surrounding Jerusalem ) .
48001023	They were only hearing it said , He who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the very faith he once reviled and which he set out to ruin and tried with all his might to destroy .
48001024	And they glorified God [ as the Author and Source of what had taken place ] in me .
48002001	THEN AFTER [ an interval ] of fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem . [ This time I went ] with Barnabas , taking Titus along with [ me ] also .
48002002	I went because it was specially and divinely revealed to me that I should go , and I put before them the Gospel [ declaring to them that ] which I preach among the Gentiles . However , [ I presented the matter ] privately before those of repute , [ for I wanted to make certain , by thus at first confining my communication to this private conference ] that I was not running or had not run in vain [ guarding against being discredited either in what I was planning to do or had already done ] .
48002003	But [ all went well ! ] even Titus , who was with me , was not compelled [ as some had anticipated ] to be circumcised , although he was a Greek .
48002004	[ My precaution was ] because of false brethren who had been secretly smuggled in [ to the Christian brotherhood ] ; they had slipped in to spy on our liberty and the freedom which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might again bring us into bondage [ under the Law of Moses ] .
48002005	To them we did not yield submission even for a moment , that the truth of the Gospel might continue to be [ preserved ] for you [ in its purity ] .
48002006	Moreover , [ no new requirements were made ] by those who were reputed to be something -- though what was their individual position and whether they really were of importance or not makes no difference to me ; God is not impressed with the positions that men hold and He is not partial and recognizes no external distinctions -- those [ I say ] who were of repute imposed no new requirements upon me [ had nothing to add to my Gospel , and from them I received no new suggestions ] .
48002007	But on the contrary , when they [ really ] saw that I had been entrusted [ to carry ] the Gospel to the uncircumcised [ Gentiles , just as definitely ] as Peter had been entrusted [ to proclaim ] the Gospel to the circumcised [ Jews , they were agreeable ] ;
48002008	For He Who motivated and fitted Peter and worked effectively through him for the mission to the circumcised , motivated and fitted me and worked through me also for [ the mission to ] the Gentiles .
48002009	And when they knew ( perceived , recognized , understood , and acknowledged ) the grace ( God’s unmerited favor and spiritual blessing ) that had been bestowed upon me , James and Cephas ( Peter ) and John , who were reputed to be pillars of the Jerusalem church , gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , with the understanding that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised ( Jews ) .
48002010	They only [ made one stipulation ] , that we were to remember the poor , which very thing I was also eager to do .
48002011	But when Cephas ( Peter ) came to Antioch , I protested and opposed him to his face [ concerning his conduct there ] , for he was blameable and stood condemned .
48002012	For up to the time that certain persons came from James , he ate his meals with the Gentile [ converts ] ; but when the men [ from Jerusalem ] arrived , he withdrew and held himself aloof from the Gentiles and [ ate ] separately for fear of those of the circumcision [ party ] .
48002013	And the rest of the Jews along with him also concealed their true convictions and acted insincerely , with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy ( their example of insincerity and pretense ) .
48002014	But as soon as I saw that they were not straightforward and were not living up to the truth of the Gospel , I said to Cephas ( Peter ) before everybody present , If you , though born a Jew , can live [ as you have been living ] like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how do you dare now to urge and practically force the Gentiles to [ comply with the ritual of Judaism and ] live like Jews ?
48002015	[ I went on to say ] Although we ourselves ( you and I ) are Jews by birth and not Gentile ( heathen ) sinners ,
48002016	Yet we know that a man is justified or reckoned righteous and in right standing with God not by works of the Law , but [ only ] through faith and [ absolute ] reliance on and adherence to and trust in Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) . [ Therefore ] even we [ ourselves ] have believed on Christ Jesus , in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the Law [ for we cannot be justified by any observance of the ritual of the Law given by Moses ] , because by keeping legal rituals and by works no human being can ever be justified ( declared righteous and put in right standing with God ) .
48002017	But if , in our desire and endeavor to be justified in Christ [ to be declared righteous and put in right standing with God wholly and solely through Christ ] , we have shown ourselves sinners also and convicted of sin , does that make Christ a minister ( a party and contributor ) to our sin ? Banish the thought ! [ Of course not ! ]
48002018	For if I [ or any others who have taught that the observance of the Law of Moses is not essential to being justified by God should now by word or practice teach or intimate that it is essential to ] build up again what I tore down , I prove myself a transgressor .
48002019	For I through the Law [ under the operation of the curse of the Law ] have [ in Christ’s death for me ] myself died to the Law and all the Law’s demands upon me , so that I may [ henceforth ] live to and for God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ [ in Him I have shared His crucifixion ] ; it is no longer I who live , but Christ ( the Messiah ) lives in me ; and the life I now live in the body I live by faith in ( by adherence to and reliance on and complete trust in ) the Son of God , Who loved me and gave Himself up for me .
48002021	[ Therefore , I do not treat God’s gracious gift as something of minor importance and defeat its very purpose ] ; I do not set aside and invalidate and frustrate and nullify the grace ( unmerited favor ) of God . For if justification ( righteousness , acquittal from guilt ) comes through [ observing the ritual of ] the Law , then Christ ( the Messiah ) died groundlessly and to no purpose and in vain . [ His death was then wholly superfluous . ]
48003001	O YOU poor and silly and thoughtless and unreflecting and senseless Galatians ! Who has fascinated or bewitched or cast a spell over you , unto whom -- right before your very eyes -- Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) was openly and graphically set forth and portrayed as crucified ?
48003002	Let me ask you this one question : Did you receive the [ Holy ] Spirit as the result of obeying the Law and doing its works , or was it by hearing [ the message of the Gospel ] and believing [ it ] ? [ Was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith ? ]
48003003	Are you so foolish and so senseless and so silly ? Having begun [ your new life spiritually ] with the [ Holy ] Spirit , are you now reaching perfection [ by dependence ] on the flesh ?
48003004	Have you suffered so many things and experienced so much all for nothing ( to no purpose ) -- if it really is to no purpose and in vain ?
48003005	Then does He Who supplies you with His marvelous [ Holy ] Spirit and works powerfully and miraculously among you do so on [ the grounds of your doing ] what the Law demands , or because of your believing in and adhering to and trusting in and relying on the message that you heard ?
48003006	Thus Abraham believed in and adhered to and trusted in and relied on God , and it was reckoned and placed to his account and credited as righteousness ( as conformity to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action ) .
48003007	Know and understand that it is [ really ] the people [ who live ] by faith who are [ the true ] sons of Abraham .
48003008	And the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify ( declare righteous , put in right standing with Himself ) the Gentiles in consequence of faith , proclaimed the Gospel [ foretelling the glad tidings of a Savior long beforehand ] to Abraham in the promise , saying , In you shall all the nations [ of the earth ] be blessed .
48003009	So then , those who are people of faith are blessed and made happy and favored by God [ as partners in fellowship ] with the believing and trusting Abraham .
48003010	And all who depend on the Law [ who are seeking to be justified by obedience to the Law of rituals ] are under a curse and doomed to disappointment and destruction , for it is written in the Scriptures , Cursed ( accursed , devoted to destruction , doomed to eternal punishment ) be everyone who does not continue to abide ( live and remain ) by all the precepts and commands written in the Book of the Law and to practice them .
48003011	Now it is evident that no person is justified ( declared righteous and brought into right standing with God ) through the Law , for the Scripture says , The man in right standing with God [ the just , the righteous ] shall live by and out of faith and he who through and by faith is declared righteous and in right standing with God shall live .
48003012	But the Law does not rest on faith [ does not require faith , has nothing to do with faith ] , for it itself says , He who does them [ the things prescribed by the Law ] shall live by them [ not by faith ] .
48003013	Christ purchased our freedom [ redeeming us ] from the curse ( doom ) of the Law [ and its condemnation ] by [ Himself ] becoming a curse for us , for it is written [ in the Scriptures ] , Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree ( is crucified ) ;
48003014	To the end that through [ their receiving ] Christ Jesus , the blessing [ promised ] to Abraham might come upon the Gentiles , so that we through faith might [ all ] receive [ the realization of ] the promise of the [ Holy ] Spirit .
48003015	To speak in terms of human relations , brethren , [ if ] even a man makes a last will and testament ( a merely human covenant ) , no one sets it aside or makes it void or adds to it when once it has been drawn up and signed ( ratified , confirmed ) .
48003016	Now the promises ( covenants , agreements ) were decreed and made to Abraham and his Seed ( his Offspring , his Heir ) . He [ God ] does not say , And to seeds ( descendants , heirs ) , as if referring to many persons , but , And to your Seed ( your Descendant , your Heir ) , obviously referring to one individual , Who is [ none other than ] Christ ( the Messiah ) .
48003017	This is my argument : The Law , which began 430 years after the covenant [ concerning the coming Messiah ] , does not and cannot annul the covenant previously established ( ratified ) by God , so as to abolish the promise and make it void .
48003018	For if the inheritance [ of the promise depends on observing ] the Law [ as these false teachers would like you to believe ] , it no longer [ depends ] on the promise ; however , God gave it to Abraham [ as a free gift solely ] by virtue of His promise .
48003019	What then was the purpose of the Law ? It was added [ later on , after the promise , to disclose and expose to men their guilt ] because of transgressions and [ to make men more conscious of the sinfulness ] of sin ; and it was intended to be in effect until the Seed ( the Descendant , the Heir ) should come , to and concerning Whom the promise had been made . And it [ the Law ] was arranged and ordained and appointed through the instrumentality of angels [ and was given ] by the hand ( in the person ) of a go-between [ Moses , an intermediary person between God and man ] .
48003020	Now a go-between ( intermediary ) has to do with and implies more than one party [ there can be no mediator with just one person ] . Yet God is [ only ] one Person [ and He was the sole party in giving that promise to Abraham . But the Law was a contract between two , God and Israel ; its validity was dependent on both ] .
48003021	Is the Law then contrary and opposed to the promises of God ? Of course not ! For if a Law had been given which could confer [ spiritual ] life , then righteousness and right standing with God would certainly have come by Law .
48003022	But the Scriptures [ picture all mankind as sinners ] shut up and imprisoned by sin , so that [ the inheritance , blessing ] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) might be given ( released , delivered , and committed ) to [ all ] those who believe [ who adhere to and trust in and rely on Him ] .
48003023	Now before the faith came , we were perpetually guarded under the Law , kept in custody in preparation for the faith that was destined to be revealed ( unveiled , disclosed ) ,
48003024	So that the Law served [ to us Jews ] as our trainer [ our guardian , our guide to Christ , to lead us ] until Christ [ came ] , that we might be justified ( declared righteous , put in right standing with God ) by and through faith .
48003025	But now that the faith has come , we are no longer under a trainer ( the guardian of our childhood ) .
48003026	For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith .
48003027	For as many [ of you ] as were baptized into Christ [ into a spiritual union and communion with Christ , the Anointed One , the Messiah ] have put on ( clothed yourselves with ) Christ .
48003028	There is [ now no distinction ] neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is not male and female ; for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	And if you belong to Christ [ are in Him Who is Abraham’s Seed ] , then you are Abraham’s offspring and [ spiritual ] heirs according to promise .
48004001	NOW WHAT I mean is that as long as the inheritor ( heir ) is a child and under age , he does not differ from a slave , although he is the master of all the estate ;
48004002	But he is under guardians and administrators or trustees until the date fixed by his father .
48004003	So we [ Jewish Christians ] also , when we were minors , were kept like slaves under [ the rules of the Hebrew ritual and subject to ] the elementary teachings of a system of external observations and regulations .
48004004	But when the proper time had fully come , God sent His Son , born of a woman , born subject to [ the regulations of ] the Law ,
48004005	To purchase the freedom of ( to ransom , to redeem , to atone for ) those who were subject to the Law , that we might be adopted and have sonship conferred upon us [ and be recognized as God’s sons ] .
48004006	And because you [ really ] are [ His ] sons , God has sent the [ Holy ] Spirit of His Son into our hearts , crying , Abba ( Father ) ! Father !
48004007	Therefore , you are no longer a slave ( bond servant ) but a son ; and if a son , then [ it follows that you are ] an heir by the aid of God , through Christ .
48004008	But at that previous time , when you had not come to be acquainted with and understand and know the true God , you [ Gentiles ] were in bondage to gods who by their very nature could not be gods at all [ gods that really did not exist ] .
48004009	Now , however , that you have come to be acquainted with and understand and know [ the true ] God , or rather to be understood and known by God , how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly and worthless elementary things [ of all religions before Christ came ] , whose slaves you once more want to become ?
48004010	You observe [ particular ] days and months and seasons and years !
48004011	I am alarmed [ about you ] , lest I have labored among and over you to no purpose and in vain .
48004012	Brethren , I beg of you , become as I am [ free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances ] , for I also have become as you are [ a Gentile ] . You did me no wrong [ in the days when I first came to you ; do not do it now ] .
48004013	On the contrary , you know that it was on account of a bodily ailment that [ I remained and ] preached the Gospel to you the first time .
48004014	And [ yet ] although my physical condition was [ such ] a trial to you , you did not regard it with contempt , or scorn and loathe and reject me ; but you received me as an angel of God , [ even ] as Christ Jesus [ Himself ] !
48004015	What has become of that blessed enjoyment and satisfaction and self-congratulation that once was yours [ in what I taught you and in your regard for me ] ? For I bear you witness that you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me [ to replace mine ] , if that were possible .
48004016	Have I then become your enemy by telling the truth to you and dealing sincerely with you ?
48004017	These men [ the Judaizing teachers ] are zealously trying to dazzle you [ paying court to you , making much of you ] , but their purpose is not honorable or worthy or for any good . What they want to do is to isolate you [ from us who oppose them ] , so that they may win you over to their side and get you to court their favor .
48004018	It is always a fine thing [ of course ] to be zealously sought after [ as you are , provided that it is ] for a good purpose and done by reason of purity of heart and life , and not just when I am present with you !
48004019	My little children , for whom I am again suffering birth pangs until Christ is completely and permanently formed ( molded ) within you ,
48004020	Would that I were with you now and could coax you vocally , for I am fearful and perplexed about you !
48004021	Tell me , you who are bent on being under the Law , will you listen to what the Law [ really ] says ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the bondmaid and one by the free woman .
48004023	But whereas the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh and had an ordinary birth , the son of the free woman was born in fulfillment of the promise .
48004024	Now all this is an allegory ; these [ two women ] represent two covenants . One covenant originated from Mount Sinai [ where the Law was given ] and bears [ children destined ] for slavery ; this is Hagar .
48004025	Now Hagar is ( stands for ) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to and belongs in the same category with the present Jerusalem , for she is in bondage together with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem above ( the Messianic kingdom of Christ ) is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written in the Scriptures , Rejoice , O barren woman , who has not given birth to children ; break forth into a joyful shout , you who are not feeling birth pangs , for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband .
48004028	But we , brethren , are children [ not by physical descent , as was Ishmael , but ] like Isaac , born in virtue of promise .
48004029	Yet [ just ] as at that time the child [ of ordinary birth ] born according to the flesh despised and persecuted him [ who was born remarkably ] according to [ the promise and the working of ] the [ Holy ] Spirit , so it is now also .
48004030	But what does the Scripture say ? Cast out and send away the slave woman and her son , for never shall the son of the slave woman be heir and share the inheritance with the son of the free woman .
48004031	So , brethren , we [ who are born again ] are not children of a slave woman [ the natural ] , but of the free [ the supernatural ] .
48005001	IN [ this ] freedom Christ has made us free [ and completely liberated us ] ; stand fast then , and do not be hampered and held ensnared and submit again to a yoke of slavery [ which you have once put off ] .
48005002	Notice , it is I , Paul , who tells you that if you receive circumcision , Christ will be of no profit ( advantage , avail ) to you [ for if you distrust Him , you can gain nothing from Him ] .
48005003	I once more protest and testify to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation and bound to practice the whole of the Law and its ordinances .
48005004	If you seek to be justified and declared righteous and to be given a right standing with God through the Law , you are brought to nothing and so separated ( severed ) from Christ . You have fallen away from grace ( from God’s gracious favor and unmerited blessing ) .
48005005	For we , [ not relying on the Law but ] through the [ Holy ] Spirit’s [ help ] , by faith anticipate and wait for the blessing and good for which our righteousness and right standing with God [ our conformity to His will in purpose , thought , and action , causes us ] to hope .
48005006	For [ if we are ] in Christ Jesus , neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything , but only faith activated and energized and expressed and working through love .
48005007	You were running the race nobly . Who has interfered in ( hindered and stopped you from ) your heeding and following the Truth ?
48005008	This [ evil ] persuasion is not from Him Who called you [ Who invited you to freedom in Christ ] .
48005009	A little leaven ( a slight inclination to error , or a few false teachers ) leavens the whole lump [ it perverts the whole conception of faith or misleads the whole church ] .
48005010	[ For my part ] I have confidence [ toward you ] in the Lord that you will take no contrary view of the matter but will come to think with me . But he who is unsettling you , whoever he is , will have to bear the penalty .
48005011	But , brethren , if I still preach circumcision [ as some accuse me of doing , as necessary to salvation ] , why am I still suffering persecution ? In that case the cross has ceased to be a stumbling block and is made meaningless ( done away ) .
48005012	I wish those who unsettle and confuse you would [ go all the way and ] cut themselves off !
48005013	For you , brethren , were [ indeed ] called to freedom ; only [ do not let your ] freedom be an incentive to your flesh and an opportunity or excuse [ for selfishness ] , but through love you should serve one another .
48005014	For the whole Law [ concerning human relationships ] is complied with in the one precept , You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself .
48005015	But if you bite and devour one another [ in partisan strife ] , be careful that you [ and your whole fellowship ] are not consumed by one another .
48005016	But I say , walk and live [ habitually ] in the [ Holy ] Spirit [ responsive to and controlled and guided by the Spirit ] ; then you will certainly not gratify the cravings and desires of the flesh ( of human nature without God ) .
48005017	For the desires of the flesh are opposed to the [ Holy ] Spirit , and the [ desires of the ] Spirit are opposed to the flesh ( godless human nature ) ; for these are antagonistic to each other [ continually withstanding and in conflict with each other ] , so that you are not free but are prevented from doing what you desire to do .
48005018	But if you are guided ( led ) by the [ Holy ] Spirit , you are not subject to the Law .
48005019	Now the doings ( practices ) of the flesh are clear ( obvious ) : they are immorality , impurity , indecency ,
48005020	Idolatry , sorcery , enmity , strife , jealousy , anger ( ill temper ) , selfishness , divisions ( dissensions ) , party spirit ( factions , sects with peculiar opinions , heresies ) ,
48005021	Envy , drunkenness , carousing , and the like . I warn you beforehand , just as I did previously , that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ the work which His presence within accomplishes ] is love , joy ( gladness ) , peace , patience ( an even temper , forbearance ) , kindness , goodness ( benevolence ) , faithfulness ,
48005023	Gentleness ( meekness , humility ) , self-control ( self-restraint , continence ) . Against such things there is no law [ that can bring a charge ] .
48005024	And those who belong to Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) have crucified the flesh ( the godless human nature ) with its passions and appetites and desires .
48005025	If we live by the [ Holy ] Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit . [ If by the Holy Spirit we have our life in God , let us go forward walking in line , our conduct controlled by the Spirit . ]
48005026	Let us not become vainglorious and self-conceited , competitive and challenging and provoking and irritating to one another , envying and being jealous of one another .
48006001	BRETHREN , IF any person is overtaken in misconduct or sin of any sort , you who are spiritual [ who are responsive to and controlled by the Spirit ] should set him right and restore and reinstate him , without any sense of superiority and with all gentleness , keeping an attentive eye on yourself , lest you should be tempted also .
48006002	Bear ( endure , carry ) one another’s burdens and troublesome moral faults , and in this way fulfill and observe perfectly the law of Christ ( the Messiah ) and complete what is lacking [ in your obedience to it ] .
48006003	For if any person thinks himself to be somebody [ too important to condescend to shoulder another’s load ] when he is nobody [ of superiority except in his own estimation ] , he deceives and deludes and cheats himself .
48006004	But let every person carefully scrutinize and examine and test his own conduct and his own work . He can then have the personal satisfaction and joy of doing something commendable [ in itself alone ] without [ resorting to ] boastful comparison with his neighbor .
48006005	For every person will have to bear ( be equal to understanding and calmly receive ) his own [ little ] load [ of oppressive faults ] .
48006006	Let him who receives instruction in the Word [ of God ] share all good things with his teacher [ contributing to his support ] .
48006007	Do not be deceived and deluded and misled ; God will not allow Himself to be sneered at ( scorned , disdained , or mocked by mere pretensions or professions , or by His precepts being set aside . ) [ He inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude God . ] For whatever a man sows , that and that only is what he will reap .
48006008	For he who sows to his own flesh ( lower nature , sensuality ) will from the flesh reap decay and ruin and destruction , but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
48006009	And let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right , for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap , if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint .
48006010	So then , as occasion and opportunity open up to us , let us do good [ morally ] to all people [ not only being useful or profitable to them , but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage ] . Be mindful to be a blessing , especially to those of the household of faith [ those who belong to God’s family with you , the believers ] .
48006011	See with what large letters I am writing with my own hand . [ Mark carefully these closing words of mine . ]
48006012	Those who want to make a good impression and a fine show in the flesh would try to compel you to receive circumcision , simply so that they may escape being persecuted for allegiance to the cross of Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
48006013	For even the circumcised [ Jews ] themselves do not [ really ] keep the Law , but they want to have you circumcised in order that they may glory in your flesh ( your subjection to external rites ) .
48006014	But far be it from me to glory [ in anything or anyone ] except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) through Whom the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world !
48006015	For neither is circumcision [ now ] of any importance , nor uncircumcision , but [ only ] a new creation [ the result of a new birth and a new nature in Christ Jesus , the Messiah ] .
48006016	Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule [ who discipline themselves and regulate their lives by this principle ] , even upon the [ true ] Israel of God !
48006017	From now on let no person trouble me [ by making it necessary for me to vindicate my apostolic authority and the divine truth of my Gospel ] , for I bear on my body the [ brand ] marks of the Lord Jesus [ the wounds , scars , and other outward evidence of persecutions -- these testify to His ownership of me ] !
48006018	The grace ( spiritual favor , blessing ) of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One , the Messiah ) be with your spirit , brethren . Amen ( so be it ) .
49001001	PAUL , AN apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , by the divine will ( the purpose and the choice of God ) to the saints ( the consecrated , set-apart ones ) at Ephesus who are also faithful and loyal and steadfast in Christ Jesus :
49001002	May grace ( God’s unmerited favor ) and spiritual peace [ which means peace with God and harmony , unity , and undisturbedness ] be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	May blessing ( praise , laudation , and eulogy ) be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual ( given by the Holy Spirit ) blessing in the heavenly realm !
49001004	Even as [ in His love ] He chose us [ actually picked us out for Himself as His own ] in Christ before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy ( consecrated and set apart for Him ) and blameless in His sight , even above reproach , before Him in love .
49001005	For He foreordained us ( destined us , planned in love for us ) to be adopted ( revealed ) as His own children through Jesus Christ , in accordance with the purpose of His will [ because it pleased Him and was His kind intent ] --
49001006	[ So that we might be ] to the praise and the commendation of His glorious grace ( favor and mercy ) , which He so freely bestowed on us in the Beloved .
49001007	In Him we have redemption ( deliverance and salvation ) through His blood , the remission ( forgiveness ) of our offenses ( shortcomings and trespasses ) , in accordance with the riches and the generosity of His gracious favor ,
49001008	Which He lavished upon us in every kind of wisdom and understanding ( practical insight and prudence ) ,
49001009	Making known to us the mystery ( secret ) of His will ( of His plan , of His purpose ) . [ And it is this : ] In accordance with His good pleasure ( His merciful intention ) which He had previously purposed and set forth in Him ,
49001010	[ He planned ] for the maturity of the times and the climax of the ages to unify all things and head them up and consummate them in Christ , [ both ] things in heaven and things on the earth .
49001011	In Him we also were made [ God’s ] heritage ( portion ) and we obtained an inheritance ; for we had been foreordained ( chosen and appointed beforehand ) in accordance with His purpose , Who works out everything in agreement with the counsel and design of His [ own ] will ,
49001012	So that we who first hoped in Christ [ who first put our confidence in Him have been destined and appointed to ] live for the praise of His glory !
49001013	In Him you also who have heard the Word of Truth , the glad tidings ( Gospel ) of your salvation , and have believed in and adhered to and relied on Him , were stamped with the seal of the long-promised Holy Spirit .
49001014	That [ Spirit ] is the guarantee of our inheritance [ the firstfruits , the pledge and foretaste , the down payment on our heritage ] , in anticipation of its full redemption and our acquiring [ complete ] possession of it -- to the praise of His glory .
49001015	For this reason , because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints ( the people of God ) ,
49001016	I do not cease to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers .
49001017	[ For I always pray to ] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [ of insight into mysteries and secrets ] in the [ deep and intimate ] knowledge of Him ,
49001018	By having the eyes of your heart flooded with light , so that you can know and understand the hope to which He has called you , and how rich is His glorious inheritance in the saints ( His set-apart ones ) ,
49001019	And [ so that you can know and understand ] what is the immeasurable and unlimited and surpassing greatness of His power in and for us who believe , as demonstrated in the working of His mighty strength ,
49001020	Which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His [ own ] right hand in the heavenly [ places ] ,
49001021	Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named [ above every title that can be conferred ] , not only in this age and in this world , but also in the age and the world which are to come .
49001022	And He has put all things under His feet and has appointed Him the universal and supreme Head of the church [ a headship exercised throughout the church ] ,
49001023	Which is His body , the fullness of Him Who fills all in all [ for in that body lives the full measure of Him Who makes everything complete , and Who fills everything everywhere with Himself ] .
49002001	AND YOU [ He made alive ] , when you were dead ( slain ) by [ your ] trespasses and sins
49002002	In which at one time you walked [ habitually ] . You were following the course and fashion of this world [ were under the sway of the tendency of this present age ] , following the prince of the power of the air . [ You were obedient to and under the control of ] the [ demon ] spirit that still constantly works in the sons of disobedience [ the careless , the rebellious , and the unbelieving , who go against the purposes of God ] .
49002003	Among these we as well as you once lived and conducted ourselves in the passions of our flesh [ our behavior governed by our corrupt and sensual nature ] , obeying the impulses of the flesh and the thoughts of the mind [ our cravings dictated by our senses and our dark imaginings ] . We were then by nature children of [ God’s ] wrath and heirs of [ His ] indignation , like the rest of mankind .
49002004	But God -- so rich is He in His mercy ! Because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which He loved us ,
49002005	Even when we were dead ( slain ) by [ our own ] shortcomings and trespasses , He made us alive together in fellowship and in union with Christ ; [ He gave us the very life of Christ Himself , the same new life with which He quickened Him , for ] it is by grace ( His favor and mercy which you did not deserve ) that you are saved ( delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ’s salvation ) .
49002006	And He raised us up together with Him and made us sit down together [ giving us joint seating with Him ] in the heavenly sphere [ by virtue of our being ] in Christ Jesus ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
49002007	He did this that He might clearly demonstrate through the ages to come the immeasurable ( limitless , surpassing ) riches of His free grace ( His unmerited favor ) in [ His ] kindness and goodness of heart toward us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For it is by free grace ( God’s unmerited favor ) that you are saved ( delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ’s salvation ) through [ your ] faith . And this [ salvation ] is not of yourselves [ of your own doing , it came not through your own striving ] , but it is the gift of God ;
49002009	Not because of works [ not the fulfillment of the Law’s demands ] , lest any man should boast . [ It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do , so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself . ]
49002010	For we are God’s [ own ] handiwork ( His workmanship ) , recreated in Christ Jesus , [ born anew ] that we may do those good works which God predestined ( planned beforehand ) for us [ taking paths which He prepared ahead of time ] , that we should walk in them [ living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live ] .
49002011	Therefore , remember that at one time you were Gentiles ( heathens ) in the flesh , called Uncircumcision by those who called themselves Circumcision , [ itself a mere mark ] in the flesh made by human hands .
49002012	[ Remember ] that you were at that time separated ( living apart ) from Christ [ excluded from all part in Him ] , utterly estranged and outlawed from the rights of Israel as a nation , and strangers with no share in the sacred compacts of the [ Messianic ] promise [ with no knowledge of or right in God’s agreements , His covenants ] . And you had no hope ( no promise ) ; you were in the world without God .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus , you who once were [ so ] far away , through ( by , in ) the blood of Christ have been brought near .
49002014	For He is [ Himself ] our peace ( our bond of unity and harmony ) . He has made us both [ Jew and Gentile ] one [ body ] , and has broken down ( destroyed , abolished ) the hostile dividing wall between us ,
49002015	By abolishing in His [ own crucified ] flesh the enmity [ caused by ] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [ which He annulled ] ; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [ one new quality of humanity out of the two ] , so making peace .
49002016	And [ He designed ] to reconcile to God both [ Jew and Gentile , united ] in a single body by means of His cross , thereby killing the mutual enmity and bringing the feud to an end .
49002017	And He came and preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off and [ peace ] to those who were near .
49002018	For it is through Him that we both [ whether far off or near ] now have an introduction ( access ) by one [ Holy ] Spirit to the Father [ so that we are able to approach Him ] .
49002019	Therefore you are no longer outsiders ( exiles , migrants , and aliens , excluded from the rights of citizens ) , but you now share citizenship with the saints ( God’s own people , consecrated and set apart for Himself ) ; and you belong to God’s [ own ] household .
49002020	You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus Himself the chief Cornerstone .
49002021	In Him the whole structure is joined ( bound , welded ) together harmoniously , and it continues to rise ( grow , increase ) into a holy temple in the Lord [ a sanctuary dedicated , consecrated , and sacred to the presence of the Lord ] .
49002022	In Him [ and in fellowship with one another ] you yourselves also are being built up [ into this structure ] with the rest , to form a fixed abode ( dwelling place ) of God in ( by , through ) the Spirit .
49003001	FOR THIS reason [ because I preached that you are thus built up together ] , I , Paul , [ am ] the prisoner of Jesus the Christ for the sake and on behalf of you Gentiles --
49003002	Assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace ( His unmerited favor ) that was entrusted to me [ to dispense to you ] for your benefit ,
49003003	[ And ] that the mystery ( secret ) was made known to me and I was allowed to comprehend it by direct revelation , as I already briefly wrote you .
49003004	When you read this you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ .
49003005	[ This mystery ] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles ( consecrated messengers ) and prophets by the [ Holy ] Spirit .
49003006	[ It is this : ] that the Gentiles are now to be fellow heirs [ with the Jews ] , members of the same body and joint partakers [ sharing ] in the same divine promise in Christ through [ their acceptance of ] the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) .
49003007	Of this [ Gospel ] I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s free grace ( undeserved favor ) which was bestowed on me by the exercise ( the working in all its effectiveness ) of His power .
49003008	To me , though I am the very least of all the saints ( God’s consecrated people ) , this grace ( favor , privilege ) was granted and graciously entrusted : to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending ( boundless , fathomless , incalculable , and exhaustless ) riches of Christ [ wealth which no human being could have searched out ] ,
49003009	Also to enlighten all men and make plain to them what is the plan [ regarding the Gentiles and providing for the salvation of all men ] of the mystery kept hidden through the ages and concealed until now in [ the mind of ] God Who created all things by Christ Jesus .
49003010	[ The purpose is ] that through the church the complicated , many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities ( principalities and powers ) in the heavenly sphere .
49003011	This is in accordance with the terms of the eternal and timeless purpose which He has realized and carried into effect in [ the person of ] Christ Jesus our Lord ,
49003012	In Whom , because of our faith in Him , we dare to have the boldness ( courage and confidence ) of free access ( an unreserved approach to God with freedom and without fear ) .
49003013	So I ask you not to lose heart [ not to faint or become despondent through fear ] at what I am suffering in your behalf . [ Rather glory in it ] for it is an honor to you .
49003014	For this reason [ seeing the greatness of this plan by which you are built together in Christ ] , I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
49003015	For Whom every family in heaven and on earth is named [ that Father from Whom all fatherhood takes its title and derives its name ] .
49003016	May He grant you out of the rich treasury of His glory to be strengthened and reinforced with mighty power in the inner man by the [ Holy ] Spirit [ Himself indwelling your innermost being and personality ] .
49003017	May Christ through your faith [ actually ] dwell ( settle down , abide , make His permanent home ) in your hearts ! May you be rooted deep in love and founded securely on love ,
49003018	That you may have the power and be strong to apprehend and grasp with all the saints [ God’s devoted people , the experience of that love ] what is the breadth and length and height and depth [ of it ] ;
49003019	[ That you may really come ] to know [ practically , through experience for yourselves ] the love of Christ , which far surpasses mere knowledge [ without experience ] ; that you may be filled [ through all your being ] unto all the fullness of God [ may have the richest measure of the divine Presence , and become a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself ] !
49003020	Now to Him Who , by ( in consequence of ) the [ action of His ] power that is at work within us , is able to [ carry out His purpose and ] do superabundantly , far over and above all that we [ dare ] ask or think [ infinitely beyond our highest prayers , desires , thoughts , hopes , or dreams ] --
49003021	To Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever . Amen ( so be it ) .
49004001	I THEREFORE , the prisoner for the Lord , appeal to and beg you to walk ( lead a life ) worthy of the [ divine ] calling to which you have been called [ with behavior that is a credit to the summons to God’s service ,
49004002	Living as becomes you ] with complete lowliness of mind ( humility ) and meekness ( unselfishness , gentleness , mildness ) , with patience , bearing with one another and making allowances because you love one another .
49004003	Be eager and strive earnestly to guard and keep the harmony and oneness of [ and produced by ] the Spirit in the binding power of peace .
49004004	[ There is ] one body and one Spirit -- just as there is also one hope [ that belongs ] to the calling you received --
49004005	[ There is ] one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	One God and Father of [ us ] all , Who is above all [ Sovereign over all ] , pervading all and [ living ] in [ us ] all .
49004007	Yet grace ( God’s unmerited favor ) was given to each of us individually [ not indiscriminately , but in different ways ] in proportion to the measure of Christ’s [ rich and bounteous ] gift .
49004008	Therefore it is said , When He ascended on high , He led captivity captive [ He led a train of vanquished foes ] and He bestowed gifts on men .
49004009	[ But He ascended ? ] Now what can this , He ascended , mean but that He had previously descended from [ the heights of ] heaven into [ the depths ] , the lower parts of the earth ?
49004010	He Who descended is the [ very ] same as He Who also has ascended high above all the heavens , that He [ His presence ] might fill all things ( the whole universe , from the lowest to the highest ) .
49004011	And His gifts were [ varied ; He Himself appointed and gave men to us ] some to be apostles ( special messengers ) , some prophets ( inspired preachers and expounders ) , some evangelists ( preachers of the Gospel , traveling missionaries ) , some pastors ( shepherds of His flock ) and teachers .
49004012	His intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of the saints ( His consecrated people ) , [ that they should do ] the work of ministering toward building up Christ’s body ( the church ) ,
49004013	[ That it might develop ] until we all attain oneness in the faith and in the comprehension of the [ full and accurate ] knowledge of the Son of God , that [ we might arrive ] at really mature manhood ( the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ’s own perfection ) , the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ and the completeness found in Him .
49004014	So then , we may no longer be children , tossed [ like ships ] to and fro between chance gusts of teaching and wavering with every changing wind of doctrine , [ the prey of ] the cunning and cleverness of unscrupulous men , [ gamblers engaged ] in every shifting form of trickery in inventing errors to mislead .
49004015	Rather , let our lives lovingly express truth [ in all things , speaking truly , dealing truly , living truly ] . Enfolded in love , let us grow up in every way and in all things into Him Who is the Head , [ even ] Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
49004016	For because of Him the whole body ( the church , in all its various parts ) , closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied , when each part [ with power adapted to its need ] is working properly [ in all its functions ] , grows to full maturity , building itself up in love .
49004017	So this I say and solemnly testify in [ the name of ] the Lord [ as in His presence ] , that you must no longer live as the heathen ( the Gentiles ) do in their perverseness [ in the folly , vanity , and emptiness of their souls and the futility ] of their minds .
49004018	Their moral understanding is darkened and their reasoning is beclouded . [ They are ] alienated ( estranged , self-banished ) from the life of God [ with no share in it ; this is ] because of the ignorance ( the want of knowledge and perception , the willful blindness ) that is deep-seated in them , due to their hardness of heart [ to the insensitiveness of their moral nature ] .
49004019	In their spiritual apathy they have become callous and past feeling and reckless and have abandoned themselves [ a prey ] to unbridled sensuality , eager and greedy to indulge in every form of impurity [ that their depraved desires may suggest and demand ] .
49004020	But you did not so learn Christ !
49004021	Assuming that you have really heard Him and been taught by Him , as [ all ] Truth is in Jesus [ embodied and personified in Him ] ,
49004022	Strip yourselves of your former nature [ put off and discard your old unrenewed self ] which characterized your previous manner of life and becomes corrupt through lusts and desires that spring from delusion ;
49004023	And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [ having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude ] ,
49004024	And put on the new nature ( the regenerate self ) created in God’s image , [ Godlike ] in true righteousness and holiness .
49004025	Therefore , rejecting all falsity and being done now with it , let everyone express the truth with his neighbor , for we are all parts of one body and members one of another .
49004026	When angry , do not sin ; do not ever let your wrath ( your exasperation , your fury or indignation ) last until the sun goes down .
49004027	Leave no [ such ] room or foothold for the devil [ give no opportunity to him ] .
49004028	Let the thief steal no more , but rather let him be industrious , making an honest living with his own hands , so that he may be able to give to those in need .
49004029	Let no foul or polluting language , nor evil word nor unwholesome or worthless talk [ ever ] come out of your mouth , but only such [ speech ] as is good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others , as is fitting to the need and the occasion , that it may be a blessing and give grace ( God’s favor ) to those who hear it .
49004030	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God [ do not offend or vex or sadden Him ] , by Whom you were sealed ( marked , branded as God’s own , secured ) for the day of redemption ( of final deliverance through Christ from evil and the consequences of sin ) .
49004031	Let all bitterness and indignation and wrath ( passion , rage , bad temper ) and resentment ( anger , animosity ) and quarreling ( brawling , clamor , contention ) and slander ( evil-speaking , abusive or blasphemous language ) be banished from you , with all malice ( spite , ill will , or baseness of any kind ) .
49004032	And become useful and helpful and kind to one another , tenderhearted ( compassionate , understanding , loving-hearted ) , forgiving one another [ readily and freely ] , as God in Christ forgave you .
49005001	THEREFORE BE imitators of God [ copy Him and follow His example ] , as well-beloved children [ imitate their father ] .
49005002	And walk in love , [ esteeming and delighting in one another ] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us , a slain offering and sacrifice to God [ for you , so that it became ] a sweet fragrance .
49005003	But immorality ( sexual vice ) and all impurity [ of lustful , rich , wasteful living ] or greediness must not even be named among you , as is fitting and proper among saints ( God’s consecrated people ) .
49005004	Let there be no filthiness ( obscenity , indecency ) nor foolish and sinful ( silly and corrupt ) talk , nor coarse jesting , which are not fitting or becoming ; but instead voice your thankfulness [ to God ] .
49005005	For be sure of this : that no person practicing sexual vice or impurity in thought or in life , or one who is covetous [ who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain ] -- for he [ in effect ] is an idolater -- has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
49005006	Let no one delude and deceive you with empty excuses and groundless arguments [ for these sins ] , for through these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of rebellion and disobedience .
49005007	So do not associate or be sharers with them .
49005008	For once you were darkness , but now you are light in the Lord ; walk as children of Light [ lead the lives of those native-born to the Light ] .
49005009	For the fruit ( the effect , the product ) of the Light or the Spirit [ consists ] in every form of kindly goodness , uprightness of heart , and trueness of life .
49005010	And try to learn [ in your experience ] what is pleasing to the Lord [ let your lives be constant proofs of what is most acceptable to Him ] .
49005011	Take no part in and have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds and enterprises of darkness , but instead [ let your lives be so in contrast as to ] expose and reprove and convict them .
49005012	For it is a shame even to speak of or mention the things that [ such people ] practice in secret .
49005013	But when anything is exposed and reproved by the light , it is made visible and clear ; and where everything is visible and clear there is light .
49005014	Therefore He says , Awake , O sleeper , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall shine ( make day dawn ) upon you and give you light .
49005015	Look carefully then how you walk ! Live purposefully and worthily and accurately , not as the unwise and witless , but as wise ( sensible , intelligent people ) ,
49005016	Making the very most of the time [ buying up each opportunity ] , because the days are evil .
49005017	Therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish , but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the Lord is .
49005018	And do not get drunk with wine , for that is debauchery ; but ever be filled and stimulated with the [ Holy ] Spirit .
49005019	Speak out to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , offering praise with voices [ and instruments ] and making melody with all your heart to the Lord ,
49005020	At all times and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father .
49005021	Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
49005022	Wives , be subject ( be submissive and adapt yourselves ) to your own husbands as [ a service ] to the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the Head of the church , Himself the Savior of [ His ] body .
49005024	As the church is subject to Christ , so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her ,
49005026	So that He might sanctify her , having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word ,
49005027	That He might present the church to Himself in glorious splendor , without spot or wrinkle or any such things [ that she might be holy and faultless ] .
49005028	Even so husbands should love their wives as [ being in a sense ] their own bodies . He who loves his own wife loves himself .
49005029	For no man ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and carefully protects and cherishes it , as Christ does the church ,
49005030	Because we are members ( parts ) of His body .
49005031	For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh .
49005032	This mystery is very great , but I speak concerning [ the relation of ] Christ and the church .
49005033	However , let each man of you [ without exception ] love his wife as [ being in a sense ] his very own self ; and let the wife see that she respects and reverences her husband [ that she notices him , regards him , honors him , prefers him , venerates , and esteems him ; and that she defers to him , praises him , and loves and admires him exceedingly ] .
49006001	CHILDREN , OBEY your parents in the Lord [ as His representatives ] , for this is just and right .
49006002	Honor ( esteem and value as precious ) your father and your mother -- this is the first commandment with a promise --
49006003	That all may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth .
49006004	Fathers , do not irritate and provoke your children to anger [ do not exasperate them to resentment ] , but rear them [ tenderly ] in the training and discipline and the counsel and admonition of the Lord .
49006005	Servants ( slaves ) , be obedient to those who are your physical masters , having respect for them and eager concern to please them , in singleness of motive and with all your heart , as [ service ] to Christ [ Himself ] --
49006006	Not in the way of eye-service [ as if they were watching you ] and only to please men , but as servants ( slaves ) of Christ , doing the will of God heartily and with your whole soul ;
49006007	Rendering service readily with goodwill , as to the Lord and not to men ,
49006008	Knowing that for whatever good anyone does , he will receive his reward from the Lord , whether he is slave or free .
49006009	You masters , act on the same [ principle ] toward them and give up threatening and using violent and abusive words , knowing that He Who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and that there is no respect of persons ( no partiality ) with Him .
49006010	In conclusion , be strong in the Lord [ be empowered through your union with Him ] ; draw your strength from Him [ that strength which His boundless might provides ] .
49006011	Put on God’s whole armor [ the armor of a heavy-armed soldier which God supplies ] , that you may be able successfully to stand up against [ all ] the strategies and the deceits of the devil .
49006012	For we are not wrestling with flesh and blood [ contending only with physical opponents ] , but against the despotisms , against the powers , against [ the master spirits who are ] the world rulers of this present darkness , against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly ( supernatural ) sphere .
49006013	Therefore put on God’s complete armor , that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [ of danger ] , and , having done all [ the crisis demands ] , to stand [ firmly in your place ] .
49006014	Stand therefore [ hold your ground ] , having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God ,
49006015	And having shod your feet in preparation [ to face the enemy with the firm-footed stability , the promptness , and the readiness produced by the good news ] of the Gospel of peace .
49006016	Lift up over all the [ covering ] shield of saving faith , upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked [ one ] .
49006017	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword that the Spirit wields , which is the Word of God .
49006018	Pray at all times ( on every occasion , in every season ) in the Spirit , with all [ manner of ] prayer and entreaty . To that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance , interceding in behalf of all the saints ( God’s consecrated people ) .
49006019	And [ pray ] also for me , that [ freedom of ] utterance may be given me , that I may open my mouth to proclaim boldly the mystery of the good news ( the Gospel ) ,
49006020	For which I am an ambassador in a coupling chain [ in prison . Pray ] that I may declare it boldly and courageously , as I ought to do .
49006021	Now that you may know how I am and what I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord [ and His service ] , will tell you everything .
49006022	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are and that he may console and cheer and encourage and strengthen your hearts .
49006023	Peace be to the brethren , and love joined with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
49006024	Grace ( God’s undeserved favor ) be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying and incorruptible [ love ] . Amen ( so let it be ) .
50001001	PAUL AND Timothy , bond servants of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , to all the saints ( God’s consecrated people ) in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the bishops ( overseers ) and deacons ( assistants ) :
50001002	Grace ( favor and blessing ) to you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
50001003	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you .
50001004	In every prayer of mine I always make my entreaty and petition for you all with joy ( delight ) .
50001005	[ I thank my God ] for your fellowship ( your sympathetic cooperation and contributions and partnership ) in advancing the good news ( the Gospel ) from the first day [ you heard it ] until now .
50001006	And I am convinced and sure of this very thing , that He Who began a good work in you will continue until the day of Jesus Christ [ right up to the time of His return ] , developing [ that good work ] and perfecting and bringing it to full completion in you .
50001007	It is right and appropriate for me to have this confidence and feel this way about you all , because you have me in your heart and I hold you in my heart as partakers and sharers , one and all with me , of grace ( God’s unmerited favor and spiritual blessing ) . [ This is true ] both when I am shut up in prison and when I am out in the defense and confirmation of the good news ( the Gospel ) .
50001008	For God is my witness how I long for and pursue you all with love , in the tender mercy of Christ Jesus [ Himself ] !
50001009	And this I pray : that your love may abound yet more and more and extend to its fullest development in knowledge and all keen insight [ that your love may display itself in greater depth of acquaintance and more comprehensive discernment ] ,
50001010	So that you may surely learn to sense what is vital , and approve and prize what is excellent and of real value [ recognizing the highest and the best , and distinguishing the moral differences ] , and that you may be untainted and pure and unerring and blameless [ so that with hearts sincere and certain and unsullied , you may approach ] the day of Christ [ not stumbling nor causing others to stumble ] .
50001011	May you abound in and be filled with the fruits of righteousness ( of right standing with God and right doing ) which come through Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) , to the honor and praise of God [ that His glory may be both manifested and recognized ] .
50001012	Now I want you to know and continue to rest assured , brethren , that what [ has happened ] to me [ this imprisonment ] has actually only served to advance and give a renewed impetus to the [ spreading of the ] good news ( the Gospel ) .
50001013	So much is this a fact that throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest [ here ] my imprisonment has become generally known to be in Christ [ that I am a prisoner in His service and for Him ] .
50001014	And [ also ] most of the brethren have derived fresh confidence in the Lord because of my chains and are much more bold to speak and publish fearlessly the Word of God [ acting with more freedom and indifference to the consequences ] .
50001015	Some , it is true , [ actually ] preach Christ ( the Messiah ) [ for no better reason than ] out of envy and rivalry ( party spirit ) , but others are doing so out of a loyal spirit and goodwill .
50001016	The latter [ proclaim Christ ] out of love , because they recognize and know that I am [ providentially ] put here for the defense of the good news ( the Gospel ) .
50001017	But the former preach Christ out of a party spirit , insincerely [ out of no pure motive , but thinking to annoy me ] , supposing they are making my bondage more bitter and my chains more galling .
50001018	But what does it matter , so long as either way , whether in pretense [ for personal ends ] or in all honesty [ for the furtherance of the Truth ] , Christ is being proclaimed ? And in that I [ now ] rejoice , yes , and I shall rejoice [ hereafter ] also .
50001019	For I am well assured and indeed know that through your prayers and a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) this will turn out for my preservation ( for the spiritual health and welfare of my own soul ) and avail toward the saving work of the Gospel .
50001020	This is in keeping with my own eager desire and persistent expectation and hope , that I shall not disgrace myself nor be put to shame in anything ; but that with the utmost freedom of speech and unfailing courage , now as always heretofore , Christ ( the Messiah ) will be magnified and get glory and praise in this body of mine and be boldly exalted in my person , whether through ( by ) life or through ( by ) death .
50001021	For me to live is Christ [ His life in me ] , and to die is gain [ the gain of the glory of eternity ] .
50001022	If , however , it is to be life in the flesh and I am to live on here , that means fruitful service for me ; so I can say nothing as to my personal preference [ I cannot choose ] ,
50001023	But I am hard pressed between the two . My yearning desire is to depart ( to be free of this world , to set forth ) and be with Christ , for that is far , far better ;
50001024	But to remain in my body is more needful and essential for your sake .
50001025	Since I am convinced of this , I know that I shall remain and stay by you all , to promote your progress and joy in believing ,
50001026	So that in me you may have abundant cause for exultation and glorying in Christ Jesus , through my coming to you again .
50001027	Only be sure as citizens so to conduct yourselves [ that ] your manner of life [ will be ] worthy of the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ , so that whether I [ do ] come and see you or am absent , I may hear this of you : that you are standing firm in united spirit and purpose , striving side by side and contending with a single mind for the faith of the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) .
50001028	And do not [ for a moment ] be frightened or intimidated in anything by your opponents and adversaries , for such [ constancy and fearlessness ] will be a clear sign ( proof and seal ) to them of [ their impending ] destruction , but [ a sure token and evidence ] of your deliverance and salvation , and that from God .
50001029	For you have been granted [ the privilege ] for Christ’s sake not only to believe in ( adhere to , rely on , and trust in ) Him , but also to suffer in His behalf .
50001030	So you are engaged in the same conflict which you saw me [ wage ] and which you now hear to be mine [ still ] .
50002001	SO BY whatever [ appeal to you there is in our mutual dwelling in Christ , by whatever ] strengthening and consoling and encouraging [ our relationship ] in Him [ affords ] , by whatever persuasive incentive there is in love , by whatever participation in the [ Holy ] Spirit [ we share ] , and by whatever depth of affection and compassionate sympathy ,
50002002	Fill up and complete my joy by living in harmony and being of the same mind and one in purpose , having the same love , being in full accord and of one harmonious mind and intention .
50002003	Do nothing from factional motives [ through contentiousness , strife , selfishness , or for unworthy ends ] or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance . Instead , in the true spirit of humility ( lowliness of mind ) let each regard the others as better than and superior to himself [ thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves ] .
50002004	Let each of you esteem and look upon and be concerned for not [ merely ] his own interests , but also each for the interests of others .
50002005	Let this same attitude and purpose and [ humble ] mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus : [ Let Him be your example in humility : ]
50002006	Who , although being essentially one with God and in the form of God [ possessing the fullness of the attributes which make God God ] , did not think this equality with God was a thing to be eagerly grasped or retained ,
50002007	But stripped Himself [ of all privileges and rightful dignity ] , so as to assume the guise of a servant ( slave ) , in that He became like men and was born a human being .
50002008	And after He had appeared in human form , He abased and humbled Himself [ still further ] and carried His obedience to the extreme of death , even the death of the cross !
50002009	Therefore [ because He stooped so low ] God has highly exalted Him and has freely bestowed on Him the name that is above every name ,
50002010	That in ( at ) the name of Jesus every knee should ( must ) bow , in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
50002011	And every tongue [ frankly and openly ] confess and acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	Therefore , my dear ones , as you have always obeyed [ my suggestions ] , so now , not only [ with the enthusiasm you would show ] in my presence but much more because I am absent , work out ( cultivate , carry out to the goal , and fully complete ) your own salvation with reverence and awe and trembling ( self-distrust , with serious caution , tenderness of conscience , watchfulness against temptation , timidly shrinking from whatever might offend God and discredit the name of Christ ) .
50002013	[ Not in your own strength ] for it is God Who is all the while effectually at work in you [ energizing and creating in you the power and desire ] , both to will and to work for His good pleasure and satisfaction and delight .
50002014	Do all things without grumbling and faultfinding and complaining [ against God ] and questioning and doubting [ among yourselves ] ,
50002015	That you may show yourselves to be blameless and guileless , innocent and uncontaminated , children of God without blemish ( faultless , unrebukable ) in the midst of a crooked and wicked generation [ spiritually perverted and perverse ] , among whom you are seen as bright lights ( stars or beacons shining out clearly ) in the [ dark ] world ,
50002016	Holding out [ to it ] and offering [ to all men ] the Word of Life , so that in the day of Christ I may have something of which exultantly to rejoice and glory in that I did not run my race in vain or spend my labor to no purpose .
50002017	Even if [ my lifeblood ] must be poured out as a libation on the sacrificial offering of your faith [ to God ] , still I am glad [ to do it ] and congratulate you all on [ your share in ] it .
50002018	And you also in like manner be glad and congratulate me on [ my share in ] it .
50002019	But I hope and trust in the Lord Jesus soon to send Timothy to you , so that I may also be encouraged and cheered by learning news of you .
50002020	For I have no one like him [ no one of so kindred a spirit ] who will be so genuinely interested in your welfare and devoted to your interests .
50002021	For the others all seek [ to advance ] their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
50002022	But Timothy’s tested worth you know , how as a son with his father he has toiled with me zealously in [ serving and helping to advance ] the good news ( the Gospel ) .
50002023	I hope therefore to send him promptly , just as soon as I know how my case is going to turn out .
50002024	But [ really ] I am confident and fully trusting in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come to you also .
50002025	However , I thought it necessary to send Epaphroditus [ back ] to you . [ He has been ] my brother and companion in labor and my fellow soldier , as well as [ having come as ] your special messenger ( apostle ) and minister to my need .
50002026	For he has been [ homesick ] longing for you all and has been distressed because you had heard that he was ill .
50002027	He certainly was ill [ too ] , near to death . But God had compassion on him , and not only on him but also on me , lest I should have sorrow [ over him ] coming upon sorrow .
50002028	So I have sent him the more willingly and eagerly , that you may be gladdened at seeing him again , and that I may be the less disquieted .
50002029	Welcome him [ home ] then in the Lord with all joy , and honor and highly appreciate men like him ,
50002030	For it was through working for Christ that he came so near death , risking his [ very ] life to complete the deficiencies in your service to me [ which distance prevented you yourselves from rendering ] .
50003001	FOR THE rest , my brethren , delight yourselves in the Lord and continue to rejoice that you are in Him . To keep writing to you [ over and over ] of the same things is not irksome to me , and it is [ a precaution ] for your safety .
50003002	Look out for those dogs [ Judaizers , legalists ] , look out for those mischief-makers , look out for those who mutilate the flesh .
50003003	For we [ Christians ] are the true circumcision , who worship God in spirit and by the Spirit of God and exult and glory and pride ourselves in Jesus Christ , and put no confidence or dependence [ on what we are ] in the flesh and on outward privileges and physical advantages and external appearances --
50003004	Though for myself I have [ at least grounds ] to rely on the flesh . If any other man considers that he has or seems to have reason to rely on the flesh and his physical and outward advantages , I have still more !
50003005	Circumcised when I was eight days old , of the race of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew [ and the son ] of Hebrews ; as to the observance of the Law I was of [ the party of ] the Pharisees ,
50003006	As to my zeal , I was a persecutor of the church , and by the Law’s standard of righteousness ( supposed justice , uprightness , and right standing with God ) I was proven to be blameless and no fault was found with me .
50003007	But whatever former things I had that might have been gains to me , I have come to consider as [ one combined ] loss for Christ’s sake .
50003008	Yes , furthermore , I count everything as loss compared to the possession of the priceless privilege ( the overwhelming preciousness , the surpassing worth , and supreme advantage ) of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him [ of perceiving and recognizing and understanding Him more fully and clearly ] . For His sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish ( refuse , dregs ) , in order that I may win ( gain ) Christ ( the Anointed One ) ,
50003009	And that I may [ actually ] be found and known as in Him , not having any [ self-achieved ] righteousness that can be called my own , based on my obedience to the Law’s demands ( ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired ) , but possessing that [ genuine righteousness ] which comes through faith in Christ ( the Anointed One ) , the [ truly ] right standing with God , which comes from God by [ saving ] faith .
50003010	[ For my determined purpose is ] that I may know Him [ that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him , perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of His Person more strongly and more clearly ] , and that I may in that same way come to know the power outflowing from His resurrection [ which it exerts over believers ] , and that I may so share His sufferings as to be continually transformed [ in spirit into His likeness even ] to His death , [ in the hope ]
50003011	That if possible I may attain to the [ spiritual and moral ] resurrection [ that lifts me ] out from among the dead [ even while in the body ] .
50003012	Not that I have now attained [ this ideal ] , or have already been made perfect , but I press on to lay hold of ( grasp ) and make my own , that for which Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) has laid hold of me and made me His own .
50003013	I do not consider , brethren , that I have captured and made it my own [ yet ] ; but one thing I do [ it is my one aspiration ] : forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead ,
50003014	I press on toward the goal to win the [ supreme and heavenly ] prize to which God in Christ Jesus is calling us upward .
50003015	So let those [ of us ] who are spiritually mature and full-grown have this mind and hold these convictions ; and if in any respect you have a different attitude of mind , God will make that clear to you also .
50003016	Only let us hold true to what we have already attained and walk and order our lives by that .
50003017	Brethren , together follow my example and observe those who live after the pattern we have set for you .
50003018	For there are many , of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears , who walk ( live ) as enemies of the cross of Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
50003019	They are doomed and their fate is eternal misery ( perdition ) ; their god is their stomach ( their appetites , their sensuality ) and they glory in their shame , siding with earthly things and being of their party .
50003020	But we are citizens of the state ( commonwealth , homeland ) which is in heaven , and from it also we earnestly and patiently await [ the coming of ] the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) [ as ] Savior ,
50003021	Who will transform and fashion anew the body of our humiliation to conform to and be like the body of His glory and majesty , by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself .
50004001	THEREFORE , MY brethren , whom I love and yearn to see , my delight and crown ( wreath of victory ) , thus stand firm in the Lord , my beloved .
50004002	I entreat and advise Euodia and I entreat and advise Syntyche to agree and to work in harmony in the Lord .
50004003	And I exhort you too , [ my ] genuine yokefellow , help these [ two women to keep on cooperating ] , for they have toiled along with me in [ the spreading of ] the good news ( the Gospel ) , as have Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the Book of Life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always [ delight , gladden yourselves in Him ] ; again I say , Rejoice !
50004005	Let all men know and perceive and recognize your unselfishness ( your considerateness , your forbearing spirit ) . The Lord is near [ He is coming soon ] .
50004006	Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything , but in every circumstance and in everything , by prayer and petition ( definite requests ) , with thanksgiving , continue to make your wants known to God .
50004007	And God’s peace [ shall be yours , that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ , and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is , that peace ] which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	For the rest , brethren , whatever is true , whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely and lovable , whatever is kind and winsome and gracious , if there is any virtue and excellence , if there is anything worthy of praise , think on and weigh and take account of these things [ fix your minds on them ] .
50004009	Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me , and model your way of living on it , and the God of peace ( of untroubled , undisturbed well-being ) will be with you .
50004010	I was made very happy in the Lord that now you have revived your interest in my welfare after so long a time ; you were indeed thinking of me , but you had no opportunity to show it .
50004011	Not that I am implying that I was in any personal want , for I have learned how to be content ( satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or disquieted ) in whatever state I am .
50004012	I know how to be abased and live humbly in straitened circumstances , and I know also how to enjoy plenty and live in abundance . I have learned in any and all circumstances the secret of facing every situation , whether well-fed or going hungry , having a sufficiency and enough to spare or going without and being in want .
50004013	I have strength for all things in Christ Who empowers me [ I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him Who infuses inner strength into me ; I am self-sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency ] .
50004014	But it was right and commendable and noble of you to contribute for my needs and to share my difficulties with me .
50004015	And you Philippians yourselves well know that in the early days of the Gospel ministry , when I left Macedonia , no church ( assembly ) entered into partnership with me and opened up [ a debit and credit ] account in giving and receiving except you only .
50004016	For even in Thessalonica you sent [ me contributions ] for my needs , not only once but a second time .
50004017	Not that I seek or am eager for [ your ] gift , but I do seek and am eager for the fruit which increases to your credit [ the harvest of blessing that is accumulating to your account ] .
50004018	But I have [ your full payment ] and more ; I have everything I need and am amply supplied , now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me . [ They are the ] fragrant odor of an offering and sacrifice which God welcomes and in which He delights .
50004019	And my God will liberally supply ( fill to the full ) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	To our God and Father be glory forever and ever ( through the endless eternities of the eternities ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
50004021	Remember me to every saint ( every born-again believer ) in Christ Jesus . The brethren ( my associates ) who are with me greet you .
50004022	All the saints ( God’s consecrated ones here ) wish to be remembered to you , especially those of Caesar’s household .
50004023	The grace ( spiritual favor and blessing ) of the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) be with your spirit . Amen ( so be it ) .
51001001	PAUL , AN apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , by the will of God , and Timothy [ our ] brother ,
51001002	To the saints ( the consecrated people of God ) and believing and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae : Grace ( spiritual favor and blessing ) to you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father .
51001003	We continually give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , as we are praying for you ,
51001004	For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [ the leaning of your entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] and of the love which you [ have and show ] for all the saints ( God’s consecrated ones ) ,
51001005	Because of the hope [ of experiencing what is ] laid up ( reserved and waiting ) for you in heaven . Of this [ hope ] you heard in the past in the message of the truth of the Gospel ,
51001006	Which has come to you . Indeed , in the whole world [ that Gospel ] is bearing fruit and still is growing [ by its own inherent power ] , even as it has done among yourselves ever since the day you first heard and came to know and understand the grace of God in truth . [ You came to know the grace or undeserved favor of God in reality , deeply and clearly and thoroughly , becoming accurately and intimately acquainted with it . ]
51001007	You so learned it from Epaphras , our beloved fellow servant . He is a faithful minister of Christ in our stead and as our representative and yours .
51001008	Also he has informed us of your love in the [ Holy ] Spirit .
51001009	For this reason we also , from the day we heard of it , have not ceased to pray and make [ special ] request for you , [ asking ] that you may be filled with the full ( deep and clear ) knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [ in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God ] and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things --
51001010	That you may walk ( live and conduct yourselves ) in a manner worthy of the Lord , fully pleasing to Him and desiring to please Him in all things , bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of God [ with fuller , deeper , and clearer insight , acquaintance , and recognition ] .
51001011	[ We pray ] that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of His glory , [ to exercise ] every kind of endurance and patience ( perseverance and forbearance ) with joy ,
51001012	Giving thanks to the Father , Who has qualified and made us fit to share the portion which is the inheritance of the saints ( God’s holy people ) in the Light .
51001013	[ The Father ] has delivered and drawn us to Himself out of the control and the dominion of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love ,
51001014	In Whom we have our redemption through His blood , [ which means ] the forgiveness of our sins .
51001015	[ Now ] He is the exact likeness of the unseen God [ the visible representation of the invisible ] ; He is the Firstborn of all creation .
51001016	For it was in Him that all things were created , in heaven and on earth , things seen and things unseen , whether thrones , dominions , rulers , or authorities ; all things were created and exist through Him [ by His service , intervention ] and in and for Him .
51001017	And He Himself existed before all things , and in Him all things consist ( cohere , are held together ) .
51001018	He also is the Head of [ His ] body , the church ; seeing He is the Beginning , the Firstborn from among the dead , so that He alone in everything and in every respect might occupy the chief place [ stand first and be preeminent ] .
51001019	For it has pleased [ the Father ] that all the divine fullness ( the sum total of the divine perfection , powers , and attributes ) should dwell in Him permanently .
51001020	And God purposed that through ( by the service , the intervention of ) Him [ the Son ] all things should be completely reconciled back to Himself , whether on earth or in heaven , as through Him , [ the Father ] made peace by means of the blood of His cross .
51001021	And although you at one time were estranged and alienated from Him and were of hostile attitude of mind in your wicked activities ,
51001022	Yet now has [ Christ , the Messiah ] reconciled [ you to God ] in the body of His flesh through death , in order to present you holy and faultless and irreproachable in His [ the Father’s ] presence .
51001023	[ And this He will do ] provided that you continue to stay with and in the faith [ in Christ ] , well-grounded and settled and steadfast , not shifting or moving away from the hope [ which rests on and is inspired by ] the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) , which you heard and which has been preached [ as being designed for and offered without restrictions ] to every person under heaven , and of which [ Gospel ] I , Paul , became a minister .
51001024	[ Even ] now I rejoice in the midst of my sufferings on your behalf . And in my own person I am making up whatever is still lacking and remains to be completed [ on our part ] of Christ’s afflictions , for the sake of His body , which is the church .
51001025	In it I became a minister in accordance with the divine stewardship which was entrusted to me for you [ as its object and for your benefit ] , to make the Word of God fully known [ among you ] --
51001026	The mystery of which was hidden for ages and generations [ from angels and men ] , but is now revealed to His holy people ( the saints ) ,
51001027	To whom God was pleased to make known how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery , which is Christ within and among you , the Hope of [ realizing the ] glory .
51001028	Him we preach and proclaim , warning and admonishing everyone and instructing everyone in all wisdom ( comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God ) , that we may present every person mature ( full-grown , fully initiated , complete , and perfect ) in Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
51001029	For this I labor [ unto weariness ] , striving with all the superhuman energy which He so mightily enkindles and works within me .
51002001	FOR I want you to know how great is my solicitude for you [ how severe an inward struggle I am engaged in for you ] and for those [ believers ] at Laodicea , and for all who [ like yourselves ] have never seen my face and known me personally .
51002002	[ For my concern is ] that their hearts may be braced ( comforted , cheered , and encouraged ) as they are knit together in love , that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding , and that they may become progressively more intimately acquainted with and may know more definitely and accurately and thoroughly that mystic secret of God , [ which is ] Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
51002003	In Him all the treasures of [ divine ] wisdom ( comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God ) and [ all the riches of spiritual ] knowledge and enlightenment are stored up and lie hidden .
51002004	I say this in order that no one may mislead and delude you by plausible and persuasive and attractive arguments and beguiling speech .
51002005	For though I am away from you in body , yet I am with you in spirit , delighted at the sight of your [ standing shoulder to shoulder in such ] orderly array and the firmness and the solid front and steadfastness of your faith in Christ [ that leaning of the entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] .
51002006	As you have therefore received Christ , [ even ] Jesus the Lord , [ so ] walk ( regulate your lives and conduct yourselves ) in union with and conformity to Him .
51002007	Have the roots [ of your being ] firmly and deeply planted [ in Him , fixed and founded in Him ] , being continually built up in Him , becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith , just as you were taught , and abounding and overflowing in it with thanksgiving .
51002008	See to it that no one carries you off as spoil or makes you yourselves captive by his so-called philosophy and intellectualism and vain deceit ( idle fancies and plain nonsense ) , following human tradition ( men’s ideas of the material rather than the spiritual world ) , just crude notions following the rudimentary and elemental teachings of the universe and disregarding [ the teachings of ] Christ ( the Messiah ) .
51002009	For in Him the whole fullness of Deity ( the Godhead ) continues to dwell in bodily form [ giving complete expression of the divine nature ] .
51002010	And you are in Him , made full and having come to fullness of life [ in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead -- Father , Son and Holy Spirit -- and reach full spiritual stature ] . And He is the Head of all rule and authority [ of every angelic principality and power ] .
51002011	In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , but in a [ spiritual ] circumcision [ performed by ] Christ by stripping off the body of the flesh ( the whole corrupt , carnal nature with its passions and lusts ) .
51002012	[ Thus you were circumcised when ] you were buried with Him in [ your ] baptism , in which you were also raised with Him [ to a new life ] through [ your ] faith in the working of God [ as displayed ] when He raised Him up from the dead .
51002013	And you who were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh ( your sensuality , your sinful carnal nature ) , [ God ] brought to life together with [ Christ ] , having [ freely ] forgiven us all our transgressions ,
51002014	Having cancelled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note ( bond ) with its legal decrees and demands which was in force and stood against us ( hostile to us ) . This [ note with its regulations , decrees , and demands ] He set aside and cleared completely out of our way by nailing it to [ His ] cross .
51002015	[ God ] disarmed the principalities and powers that were ranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them , in triumphing over them in Him and in it [ the cross ] .
51002016	Therefore let no one sit in judgment on you in matters of food and drink , or with regard to a feast day or a New Moon or a Sabbath .
51002017	Such [ things ] are only the shadow of things that are to come , and they have only a symbolic value . But the reality ( the substance , the solid fact of what is foreshadowed , the body of it ) belongs to Christ .
51002018	Let no one defraud you by acting as an umpire and declaring you unworthy and disqualifying you for the prize , insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels , taking his stand on visions [ he claims ] he has seen , vainly puffed up by his sensuous notions and inflated by his unspiritual thoughts and fleshly conceit ,
51002019	And not holding fast to the Head , from Whom the entire body , supplied and knit together by means of its joints and ligaments , grows with a growth that is from God .
51002020	If then you have died with Christ to material ways of looking at things and have escaped from the world’s crude and elemental notions and teachings of externalism , why do you live as if you still belong to the world ? [ Why do you submit to rules and regulations ? -- such as ]
51002021	Do not handle [ this ] , Do not taste [ that ] , Do not even touch [ them ] ,
51002022	Referring to things all of which perish with being used . To do this is to follow human precepts and doctrines .
51002023	Such [ practices ] have indeed the outward appearance [ that popularly passes ] for wisdom , in promoting self-imposed rigor of devotion and delight in self-humiliation and severity of discipline of the body , but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh ( the lower nature ) . [ Instead , they do not honor God but serve only to indulge the flesh . ]
51003001	IF THEN you have been raised with Christ [ to a new life , thus sharing His resurrection from the dead ] , aim at and seek the [ rich , eternal treasures ] that are above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God .
51003002	And set your minds and keep them set on what is above ( the higher things ) , not on the things that are on the earth .
51003003	For [ as far as this world is concerned ] you have died , and your [ new , real ] life is hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , Who is our life , appears , then you also will appear with Him in [ the splendor of His ] glory .
51003005	So kill ( deaden , deprive of power ) the evil desire lurking in your members [ those animal impulses and all that is earthly in you that is employed in sin ] : sexual vice , impurity , sensual appetites , unholy desires , and all greed and covetousness , for that is idolatry ( the deifying of self and other created things instead of God ) .
51003006	It is on account of these [ very sins ] that the [ holy ] anger of God is ever coming upon the sons of disobedience ( those who are obstinately opposed to the divine will ) ,
51003007	Among whom you also once walked , when you were living in and addicted to [ such practices ] .
51003008	But now put away and rid yourselves [ completely ] of all these things : anger , rage , bad feeling toward others , curses and slander , and foulmouthed abuse and shameful utterances from your lips !
51003009	Do not lie to one another , for you have stripped off the old ( unregenerate ) self with its evil practices ,
51003010	And have clothed yourselves with the new [ spiritual self ] , which is [ ever in the process of being ] renewed and remolded into [ fuller and more perfect knowledge upon ] knowledge after the image ( the likeness ) of Him Who created it .
51003011	[ In this new creation all distinctions vanish . ] There is no room for and there can be neither Greek nor Jew , circumcised nor uncircumcised , [ nor difference between nations whether alien ] barbarians or Scythians [ who are the most savage of all ] , nor slave or free man ; but Christ is all and in all [ everything and everywhere , to all men , without distinction of person ] .
51003012	Clothe yourselves therefore , as God’s own chosen ones ( His own picked representatives ) , [ who are ] purified and holy and well-beloved [ by God Himself , by putting on behavior marked by ] tenderhearted pity and mercy , kind feeling , a lowly opinion of yourselves , gentle ways , [ and ] patience [ which is tireless and long-suffering , and has the power to endure whatever comes , with good temper ] .
51003013	Be gentle and forbearing with one another and , if one has a difference ( a grievance or complaint ) against another , readily pardoning each other ; even as the Lord has [ freely ] forgiven you , so must you also [ forgive ] .
51003014	And above all these [ put on ] love and enfold yourselves with the bond of perfectness [ which binds everything together completely in ideal harmony ] .
51003015	And let the peace ( soul harmony which comes ) from Christ rule ( act as umpire continually ) in your hearts [ deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds , in that peaceful state ] to which as [ members of Christ’s ] one body you were also called [ to live ] . And be thankful ( appreciative ) , [ giving praise to God always ] .
51003016	Let the word [ spoken by ] Christ ( the Messiah ) have its home [ in your hearts and minds ] and dwell in you in [ all its ] richness , as you teach and admonish and train one another in all insight and intelligence and wisdom [ in spiritual things , and as you sing ] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , making melody to God with [ His ] grace in your hearts .
51003017	And whatever you do [ no matter what it is ] in word or deed , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and in [ dependence upon ] His Person , giving praise to God the Father through Him .
51003018	Wives , be subject to your husbands [ subordinate and adapt yourselves to them ] , as is right and fitting and your proper duty in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives [ be affectionate and sympathetic with them ] and do not be harsh or bitter or resentful toward them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this is pleasing to the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not provoke or irritate or fret your children [ do not be hard on them or harass them ] , lest they become discouraged and sullen and morose and feel inferior and frustrated . [ Do not break their spirit . ]
51003022	Servants , obey in everything those who are your earthly masters , not only when their eyes are on you as pleasers of men , but in simplicity of purpose [ with all your heart ] because of your reverence for the Lord and as a sincere expression of your devotion to Him .
51003023	Whatever may be your task , work at it heartily ( from the soul ) , as [ something done ] for the Lord and not for men ,
51003024	Knowing [ with all certainty ] that it is from the Lord [ and not from men ] that you will receive the inheritance which is your [ real ] reward . [ The One Whom ] you are actually serving [ is ] the Lord Christ ( the Messiah ) .
51003025	For he who deals wrongfully will [ reap the fruit of his folly and ] be punished for his wrongdoing . And [ with God ] there is no partiality [ no matter what a person’s position may be , whether he is the slave or the master ] .
51004001	MASTERS , [ on your part ] deal with your slaves justly and fairly , knowing that also you have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Be earnest and unwearied and steadfast in your prayer [ life ] , being [ both ] alert and intent in [ your praying ] with thanksgiving .
51004003	And at the same time pray for us also , that God may open a door to us for the Word ( the Gospel ) , to proclaim the mystery concerning Christ ( the Messiah ) on account of which I am in prison ;
51004004	That I may proclaim it fully and make it clear [ speak boldly and unfold that mystery ] , as is my duty .
51004005	Behave yourselves wisely [ living prudently and with discretion ] in your relations with those of the outside world ( the non-Christians ) , making the very most of the time and seizing ( buying up ) the opportunity .
51004006	Let your speech at all times be gracious ( pleasant and winsome ) , seasoned [ as it were ] with salt , [ so that you may never be at a loss ] to know how you ought to answer anyone [ who puts a question to you ] .
51004007	Tychicus will give you full information about my affairs ; [ he is ] a much-loved brother and faithful ministering assistant and fellow servant [ with us ] in the Lord .
51004008	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are faring and that he may comfort and cheer and encourage your hearts .
51004009	And with [ him is ] Onesimus , [ our ] faithful and beloved brother , who is [ one ] of yourselves . They will let you know everything that has taken place here [ in Rome ] .
51004010	Aristarchus my fellow prisoner wishes to be remembered to you , as does Mark the relative of Barnabas . You received instructions concerning him ; if he comes to you give him a [ hearty ] welcome .
51004011	And [ greetings also from ] Jesus , who is called Justus . These [ Hebrew Christians ] alone of the circumcision are among my fellow workers for [ the extension of ] God’s kingdom , and they have proved a relief and a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of yourselves , a servant of Christ Jesus , sends you greetings . [ He is ] always striving for you earnestly in his prayers , [ pleading ] that you may [ as persons of ripe character and clear conviction ] stand firm and mature [ in spiritual growth ] , convinced and fully assured in everything willed by God .
51004013	For I bear him testimony that he has labored hard in your behalf and for [ the believers ] in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke the beloved physician and Demas salute you .
51004015	Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea , and to Nympha and the assembly ( the church ) which meets in her house .
51004016	And when this epistle has been read before you , [ see ] that it is read also in the assembly ( the church ) of the Laodiceans , and also [ see ] that you yourselves in turn read the [ letter that comes to you ] from Laodicea .
51004017	And say to Archippus , See that you discharge carefully [ the duties of ] the ministry and fulfill the stewardship which you have received in the Lord .
51004018	I , Paul , [ add this final ] greeting , writing with my own hand . Remember I am still in prison and in chains . May grace ( God’s unmerited favor and blessing ) be with you ! Amen ( so be it ) .
52001001	PAUL , SILVANUS ( Silas ) , and Timothy , to the assembly ( church ) of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) : Grace ( spiritual blessing and divine favor ) to you and [ heart ] peace .
52001002	We are ever giving thanks to God for all of you , continually mentioning [ you when engaged ] in our prayers ,
52001003	Recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith and service motivated by love and unwavering hope in [ the return of ] our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
52001004	[ O ] brethren beloved by God , we recognize and know that He has selected ( chosen ) you ;
52001005	For our [ preaching of the ] glad tidings ( the Gospel ) came to you not only in word , but also in [ its own inherent ] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction and absolute certainty [ on our part ] . You know what kind of men we proved [ ourselves ] to be among you for your good .
52001006	And you [ set yourselves to ] become imitators of us and [ through us ] of the Lord Himself , for you welcomed our message in [ spite of ] much persecution , with joy [ inspired ] by the Holy Spirit ;
52001007	So that you [ thus ] became a pattern to all the believers ( those who adhere to , trust in , and rely on Christ Jesus ) in Macedonia and Achaia ( most of Greece ) .
52001008	For not only has the Word concerning and from the Lord resounded forth from you unmistakably in Macedonia and Achaia , but everywhere the report has gone forth of your faith in God [ of your leaning of your whole personality on Him in complete trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] . So we [ find that we ] never need to tell people anything [ further about it ] .
52001009	For they themselves volunteer testimony concerning us , telling what an entrance we had among you , and how you turned to God from [ your ] idols to serve a God Who is alive and true and genuine ,
52001010	And [ how you ] look forward to and await the coming of His Son from heaven , Whom He raised from the dead -- Jesus , Who personally rescues and delivers us out of and from the wrath [ bringing punishment ] which is coming [ upon the impenitent ] and draws us to Himself [ investing us with all the privileges and rewards of the new life in Christ , the Messiah ] .
52002001	FOR YOU yourselves know , brethren , that our coming among you was not useless and fruitless .
52002002	But though we had already suffered and been outrageously treated at Philippi , as you know , yet in [ the strength of ] our God we summoned courage to proclaim to you unfalteringly the good news ( the Gospel ) with earnest contention and much conflict and great opposition .
52002003	For our appeal [ in preaching ] does not [ originate ] from delusion or error or impure purpose or motive , nor in fraud or deceit .
52002004	But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) , so we speak not to please men but to please God , Who tests our hearts [ expecting them to be approved ] .
52002005	For as you well know , we never resorted either to words of flattery or to any cloak to conceal greedy motives or pretexts for gain , [ as ] God is our witness .
52002006	Nor did we seek to extract praise and honor and glory from men , either from you or from anyone else , though we might have asserted our authority [ stood on our dignity and claimed honor ] as apostles ( special missionaries ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
52002007	But we behaved gently when we were among you , like a devoted mother nursing and cherishing her own children .
52002008	So , being thus tenderly and affectionately desirous of you , we continued to share with you not only God’s good news ( the Gospel ) but also our own lives as well , for you had become so very dear to us .
52002009	For you recall our hard toil and struggles , brethren . We worked night and day [ and plied our trade ] in order not to be a burden to any of you [ for our support ] while we proclaimed the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) of God to you .
52002010	You are witnesses , [ yes ] and God [ also ] , how unworldly and upright and blameless was our behavior toward you believers [ who adhered to and trusted in and relied on our Lord Jesus Christ ] .
52002011	For you know how , as a father [ dealing with ] his children , we used to exhort each of you personally , stimulating and encouraging and charging you
52002012	To live lives worthy of God , Who calls you into His own kingdom and the glorious blessedness [ into which true believers will enter after Christ’s return ] .
52002013	And we also [ especially ] thank God continually for this , that when you received the message of God [ which you heard ] from us , you welcomed it not as the word of [ mere ] men , but as it truly is , the Word of God , which is effectually at work in you who believe [ exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it ] .
52002014	For you , brethren , became imitators of the assemblies ( churches ) of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea , for you too have suffered the same kind of treatment from your own fellow countrymen as they did [ who were persecuted at the hands ] of the Jews ,
52002015	Who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and harassed and drove us out , and continue to make themselves hateful and offensive to God and to show themselves foes of all men ,
52002016	Forbidding and hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles ( the nations ) that they may be saved . So as always they fill up [ to the brim the measure of ] their sins . But God’s wrath has come upon them at last [ completely and forever ] !
52002017	But since we were bereft of you , brethren , for a little while in person , [ of course ] not in heart , we endeavored the more eagerly and with great longing to see you face to face ,
52002018	Because it was our will to come to you . [ I mean that ] I , Paul , again and again [ wanted to come ] , but Satan hindered and impeded us .
52002019	For what is our hope or happiness or our victor’s wreath of exultant triumph when we stand in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming ? Is it not you ?
52002020	For you are [ indeed ] our glory and our joy !
52003001	THEREFORE , WHEN [ the suspense of separation and our yearning for some personal communication from you ] became intolerable , we consented to being left behind alone at Athens .
52003002	And we sent Timothy , our brother and God’s servant in [ spreading ] the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ , to strengthen and establish and to exhort and comfort and encourage you in your faith ,
52003003	That no one [ of you ] should be disturbed and beguiled and led astray by these afflictions and difficulties [ to which I have referred ] . For you yourselves know that this is [ unavoidable in our position , and must be recognized as ] our appointed lot .
52003004	For even when we were with you , [ you know ] we warned you plainly beforehand that we were to be pressed with difficulties and made to suffer affliction , just as to your own knowledge it has [ since ] happened .
52003005	That is the reason that , when I could bear [ the suspense ] no longer , I sent that I might learn [ how you were standing the strain , and the endurance of ] your faith , [ for I was fearful ] lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our toil [ among you should prove to ] be fruitless and to no purpose .
52003006	But now that Timothy has just come back to us from [ his visit to ] you and has brought us the good news of [ the steadfastness of ] your faith and [ the warmth of your ] love , and [ reported ] how kindly you cherish a constant and affectionate remembrance of us [ and that you are ] longing to see us as we [ are to see ] you ,
52003007	Brethren , for this reason , in [ spite of all ] our stress and crushing difficulties we have been filled with comfort and cheer about you [ because of ] your faith ( the leaning of your whole personality on God in complete trust and confidence ) .
52003008	Because now we [ really ] live , if you stand [ firm ] in the Lord .
52003009	For what [ adequate ] thanksgiving can we render to God for you for all the gladness and delight which we enjoy for your sakes before our God ?
52003010	[ And we ] continue to pray especially and with most intense earnestness night and day that we may see you face to face and mend and make good whatever may be imperfect and lacking in your faith .
52003011	Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) guide our steps to you .
52003012	And may the Lord make you to increase and excel and overflow in love for one another and for all people , just as we also do for you ,
52003013	So that He may strengthen and confirm and establish your hearts faultlessly pure and unblamable in holiness in the sight of our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) with all His saints ( the holy and glorified people of God ) ! Amen , ( so be it ) !
52004001	FURTHERMORE , BRETHREN , we beg and admonish you in [ virtue of our union with ] the Lord Jesus , that [ you follow the instructions which ] you learned from us about how you ought to walk so as to please and gratify God , as indeed you are doing , [ and ] that you do so even more and more abundantly [ attaining yet greater perfection in living this life ] .
52004002	For you know what charges and precepts we gave you [ on the authority and by the inspiration of ] the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For this is the will of God , that you should be consecrated ( separated and set apart for pure and holy living ) : that you should abstain and shrink from all sexual vice ,
52004004	That each one of you should know how to possess ( control , manage ) his own body in consecration ( purity , separated from things profane ) and honor ,
52004005	Not [ to be used ] in the passion of lust like the heathen , who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of His will ,
52004006	That no man transgress and overreach his brother and defraud him in this matter or defraud his brother in business . For the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as we have already warned you solemnly and told you plainly .
52004007	For God has not called us to impurity but to consecration [ to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity ] .
52004008	Therefore whoever disregards ( sets aside and rejects this ) disregards not man but God , Whose [ very ] Spirit [ Whom ] He gives to you is holy ( chaste , pure ) .
52004009	But concerning brotherly love [ for all other Christians ] , you have no need to have anyone write you , for you yourselves have been [ personally ] taught by God to love one another .
52004010	And indeed you already are [ extending and displaying your love ] to all the brethren throughout Macedonia . But we beseech and earnestly exhort you , brethren , that you excel [ in this matter ] more and more ,
52004011	To make it your ambition and definitely endeavor to live quietly and peacefully , to mind your own affairs , and to work with your hands , as we charged you ,
52004012	So that you may bear yourselves becomingly and be correct and honorable and command the respect of the outside world , being dependent on nobody [ self-supporting ] and having need of nothing .
52004013	Now also we would not have you ignorant , brethren , about those who fall asleep [ in death ] , that you may not grieve [ for them ] as the rest do who have no hope [ beyond the grave ] .
52004014	For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so God will also bring with Him through Jesus those who have fallen asleep [ in death ] .
52004015	For this we declare to you by the Lord’s [ own ] word , that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede [ into His presence ] or have any advantage at all over those who have previously fallen asleep [ in Him in death ] .
52004016	For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud cry of summons , with the shout of an archangel , and with the blast of the trumpet of God . And those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first .
52004017	Then we , the living ones who remain [ on the earth ] , shall simultaneously be caught up along with [ the resurrected dead ] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air ; and so always ( through the eternity of the eternities ) we shall be with the Lord !
52004018	Therefore comfort and encourage one another with these words .
52005001	BUT AS to the suitable times and the precise seasons and dates , brethren , you have no necessity for anything being written to you .
52005002	For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the [ return of the ] Lord will come [ as unexpectedly and suddenly ] as a thief in the night .
52005003	When people are saying , All is well and secure , and , There is peace and safety , then in a moment unforeseen destruction ( ruin and death ) will come upon them as suddenly as labor pains come upon a woman with child ; and they shall by no means escape , for there will be no escape .
52005004	But you are not in [ given up to the power of ] darkness , brethren , for that day to overtake you by surprise like a thief .
52005005	For you are all sons of light and sons of the day ; we do not belong either to the night or to darkness .
52005006	Accordingly then , let us not sleep , as the rest do , but let us keep wide awake ( alert , watchful , cautious , and on our guard ) and let us be sober ( calm , collected , and circumspect ) .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep at night , and those who are drunk , get drunk at night .
52005008	But we belong to the day ; therefore , let us be sober and put on the breastplate ( corslet ) of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God has not appointed us to [ incur His ] wrath [ He did not select us to condemn us ] , but [ that we might ] obtain [ His ] salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah )
52005010	Who died for us so that whether we are still alive or are dead [ at Christ’s appearing ] , we might live together with Him and share His life .
52005011	Therefore encourage ( admonish , exhort ) one another and edify ( strengthen and build up ) one another , just as you are doing .
52005012	Now also we beseech you , brethren , get to know those who labor among you [ recognize them for what they are , acknowledge and appreciate and respect them all ] -- your leaders who are over you in the Lord and those who warn and kindly reprove and exhort you .
52005013	And hold them in very high and most affectionate esteem in [ intelligent and sympathetic ] appreciation of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	And we earnestly beseech you , brethren , admonish ( warn and seriously advise ) those who are out of line [ the loafers , the disorderly , and the unruly ] ; encourage the timid and fainthearted , help and give your support to the weak souls , [ and ] be very patient with everybody [ always keeping your temper ] .
52005015	See that none of you repays another with evil for evil , but always aim to show kindness and seek to do good to one another and to everybody .
52005016	Be happy [ in your faith ] and rejoice and be glad-hearted continually ( always ) ;
52005017	Be unceasing in prayer [ praying perseveringly ] ;
52005018	Thank [ God ] in everything [ no matter what the circumstances may be , be thankful and give thanks ] , for this is the will of God for you [ who are ] in Christ Jesus [ the Revealer and Mediator of that will ] .
52005019	Do not quench ( suppress or subdue ) the [ Holy ] Spirit ;
52005020	Do not spurn the gifts and utterances of the prophets [ do not depreciate prophetic revelations nor despise inspired instruction or exhortation or warning ] .
52005021	But test and prove all things [ until you can recognize ] what is good ; [ to that ] hold fast .
52005022	Abstain from evil [ shrink from it and keep aloof from it ] in whatever form or whatever kind it may be .
52005023	And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through [ separate you from profane things , make you pure and wholly consecrated to God ] ; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved sound and complete [ and found ] blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
52005024	Faithful is He Who is calling you [ to Himself ] and utterly trustworthy , and He will also do it [ fulfill His call by hallowing and keeping you ] .
52005025	Brethren , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all the brethren with a sacred kiss .
52005027	I solemnly charge you [ in the name of ] the Lord to have this letter read before all the brethren .
52005028	The grace ( the unmerited favor and blessings ) of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you all . Amen , ( so be it ) .
53001001	PAUL , SILVANUS ( Silas ) , and Timothy , to the church ( assembly ) of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) :
53001002	Grace ( unmerited favor ) be to you and [ heart ] peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
53001003	We ought and indeed are obligated [ as those in debt ] to give thanks always to God for you , brethren , as is fitting , because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of every one of you each toward the others is increasing and abounds .
53001004	And this is a cause of our mentioning you with pride among the churches ( assemblies ) of God for your steadfastness ( your unflinching endurance and patience ) and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecutions and crushing distresses and afflictions under which you are holding up .
53001005	This is positive proof of the just and right judgment of God to the end that you may be deemed deserving of His kingdom [ a plain token of His fair verdict which designs that you should be made and counted worthy of the kingdom of God ] , for the sake of which you are also suffering .
53001006	[ It is a fair decision ] since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with distress and affliction those who distress and afflict you ,
53001007	And to [ recompense ] you who are so distressed and afflicted [ by granting you ] relief and rest along with us [ your fellow sufferers ] when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire ,
53001008	To deal out retribution ( chastisement and vengeance ) upon those who do not know or perceive or become acquainted with God , and [ upon those ] who ignore and refuse to obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53001009	Such people will pay the penalty and suffer the punishment of everlasting ruin ( destruction and perdition ) and eternal exclusion and banishment from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power ,
53001010	When He comes to be glorified in His saints [ on that day He will be made more glorious in His consecrated people ] , and [ He will ] be marveled at and admired [ in His glory reflected ] in all who have believed [ who have adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Him ] , because our witnessing among you was confidently accepted and believed [ and confirmed in your lives ] .
53001011	With this in view we constantly pray for you , that our God may deem and count you worthy of [ your ] calling and [ His ] every gracious purpose of goodness , and with power may complete in [ your ] every particular work of faith ( faith which is that leaning of the whole human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) .
53001012	Thus may the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified and become more glorious through and in you , and may you [ also be glorified ] in Him according to the grace ( favor and blessing ) of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
53002001	BUT RELATIVE to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and our gathering together to [ meet ] Him , we beg you , brethren ,
53002002	Not to allow your minds to be quickly unsettled or disturbed or kept excited or alarmed , whether it be by some [ pretended ] revelation of [ the ] Spirit or by word or by letter [ alleged to be ] from us , to the effect that the day of the Lord has [ already ] arrived and is here .
53002003	Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way , for that day will not come except the apostasy comes first [ unless the predicted great falling away of those who have professed to be Christians has come ] , and the man of lawlessness ( sin ) is revealed , who is the son of doom ( of perdition ) ,
53002004	Who opposes and exalts himself so proudly and insolently against and over all that is called God or that is worshiped , [ even to his actually ] taking his seat in the temple of God , proclaiming that he himself is God .
53002005	Do you not recollect that when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
53002006	And now you know what is restraining him [ from being revealed at this time ] ; it is so that he may be manifested ( revealed ) in his own [ appointed ] time .
53002007	For the mystery of lawlessness ( that hidden principle of rebellion against constituted authority ) is already at work in the world , [ but it is ] restrained only until he who restrains is taken out of the way .
53002008	And then the lawless one ( the antichrist ) will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by His appearing at His coming .
53002009	The coming [ of the lawless one , the antichrist ] is through the activity and working of Satan and will be attended by great power and with all sorts of [ pretended ] miracles and signs and delusive marvels -- [ all of them ] lying wonders --
53002010	And by unlimited seduction to evil and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing ( going to perdition ) because they did not welcome the Truth but refused to love it that they might be saved .
53002011	Therefore God sends upon them a misleading influence , a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false ,
53002012	In order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe in [ who refused to adhere to , trust in , and rely on ] the Truth , but [ instead ] took pleasure in unrighteousness .
53002013	But we , brethren beloved by the Lord , ought and are obligated [ as those who are in debt ] to give thanks always to God for you , because God chose you from the beginning as His firstfruits ( first converts ) for salvation through the sanctifying work of the [ Holy ] Spirit and [ your ] belief in ( adherence to , trust in , and reliance on ) the Truth .
53002014	[ It was ] to this end that He called you through our Gospel , so that you may obtain and share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
53002015	So then , brethren , stand firm and hold fast to the traditions and instructions which you were taught by us , whether by our word of mouth or by letter .
53002016	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father , Who loved us and gave us everlasting consolation and encouragement and well-founded hope through [ His ] grace ( unmerited favor ) ,
53002017	Comfort and encourage your hearts and strengthen them [ make them steadfast and keep them unswerving ] in every good work and word .
53003001	FURTHERMORE , BRETHREN , do pray for us , that the Word of the Lord may speed on ( spread rapidly and run its course ) and be glorified ( extolled ) and triumph , even as [ it has done ] with you ,
53003002	And that we may be delivered from perverse ( improper , unrighteous ) and wicked ( actively malicious ) men , for not everybody has faith and is held by it .
53003003	Yet the Lord is faithful , and He will strengthen [ you ] and set you on a firm foundation and guard you from the evil [ one ] .
53003004	And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we suggest and with which we charge you .
53003005	May the Lord direct your hearts into [ realizing and showing ] the love of God and into the steadfastness and patience of Christ and in waiting for His return .
53003006	Now we charge you , brethren , in the name and on the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) that you withdraw and keep away from every brother ( fellow believer ) who is slack in the performance of duty and is disorderly , living as a shirker and not walking in accord with the traditions and instructions that you have received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate our example , for we were not disorderly or shirking of duty when we were with you [ we were not idle ] .
53003008	Nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it , but with toil and struggle we worked night and day , that we might not be a burden or impose on any of you [ for our support ] .
53003009	[ It was ] not because we do not have a right [ to such support ] , but [ we wished ] to make ourselves an example for you to follow .
53003010	For while we were yet with you , we gave you this rule and charge : If anyone will not work , neither let him eat .
53003011	Indeed , we hear that some among you are disorderly [ that they are passing their lives in idleness , neglectful of duty ] , being busy with other people’s affairs instead of their own and doing no work .
53003012	Now we charge and exhort such persons [ as ministers in Him exhorting those ] in the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) that they work in quietness and earn their own food and other necessities .
53003013	And as for you , brethren , do not become weary or lose heart in doing right [ but continue in well-doing without weakening ] .
53003014	But if anyone [ in the church ] refuses to obey what we say in this letter , take note of that person and do not associate with him , so that he may be ashamed .
53003015	Do not regard him as an enemy , but simply admonish and warn him as [ being still ] a brother .
53003016	Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace ( the peace of His kingdom ) at all times and in all ways [ under all circumstances and conditions , whatever comes ] . The Lord [ be ] with you all .
53003017	I , Paul , write you this final greeting with my own hand . This is the mark and sign [ that it is not a forgery ] in every letter of mine . It is the way I write [ my handwriting and signature ] .
53003018	The grace ( spiritual blessing and favor ) of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) .
54001001	PAUL , AN apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus by appointment and command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , our Hope ,
54001002	To Timothy , my true son in the faith : Grace ( spiritual blessing and favor ) , mercy , and [ heart ] peace [ be yours ] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia , stay on where you are at Ephesus in order that you may warn and admonish and charge certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine ,
54001004	Nor to give importance to or occupy themselves with legends ( fables , myths ) and endless genealogies , which foster and promote useless speculations and questionings rather than acceptance in faith of God’s administration and the divine training that is in faith ( in that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence ) --
54001005	Whereas the object and purpose of our instruction and charge is love , which springs from a pure heart and a good ( clear ) conscience and sincere ( unfeigned ) faith .
54001006	But certain individuals have missed the mark on this very matter [ and ] have wandered away into vain arguments and discussions and purposeless talk .
54001007	They are ambitious to be doctors of the Law ( teachers of the Mosaic ritual ) , but they have no understanding either of the words and terms they use or of the subjects about which they make [ such ] dogmatic assertions .
54001008	Now we recognize and know that the Law is good if anyone uses it lawfully [ for the purpose for which it was designed ] ,
54001009	Knowing and understanding this : that the Law is not enacted for the righteous ( the upright and just , who are in right standing with God ) , but for the lawless and unruly , for the ungodly and sinful , for the irreverent and profane , for those who strike and beat and [ even ] murder fathers and strike and beat and [ even ] murder mothers , for manslayers ,
54001010	[ For ] impure and immoral persons , those who abuse themselves with men , kidnapers , liars , perjurers -- and whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching and sound doctrine
54001011	As laid down by the glorious Gospel of the blessed God , with which I have been entrusted .
54001012	I give thanks to Him Who has granted me [ the needed ] strength and made me able [ for this ] , Christ Jesus our Lord , because He has judged and counted me faithful and trustworthy , appointing me to [ this stewardship of ] the ministry .
54001013	Though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and was shamefully and outrageously and aggressively insulting [ to Him ] , nevertheless , I obtained mercy because I had acted out of ignorance in unbelief .
54001014	And the grace ( unmerited favor and blessing ) of our Lord [ actually ] flowed out superabundantly and beyond measure for me , accompanied by faith and love that are [ to be realized ] in Christ Jesus .
54001015	The saying is sure and true and worthy of full and universal acceptance , that Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am foremost .
54001016	But I obtained mercy for the reason that in me , as the foremost [ of sinners ] , Jesus Christ might show forth and display all His perfect long-suffering and patience for an example to [ encourage ] those who would thereafter believe on Him for [ the gaining of ] eternal life .
54001017	Now to the King of eternity , incorruptible and immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever ( to the ages of ages ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
54001018	This charge and admonition I commit in trust to you , Timothy , my son , in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning you , so that inspired and aided by them you may wage the good warfare ,
54001019	Holding fast to faith ( that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence ) and having a good ( clear ) conscience . By rejecting and thrusting from them [ their conscience ] , some individuals have made shipwreck of their faith .
54001020	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have delivered to Satan in order that they may be disciplined [ by punishment and learn ] not to blaspheme .
54002001	FIRST OF all , then , I admonish and urge that petitions , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men ,
54002002	For kings and all who are in positions of authority or high responsibility , that [ outwardly ] we may pass a quiet and undisturbed life [ and inwardly ] a peaceable one in all godliness and reverence and seriousness in every way .
54002003	For such [ praying ] is good and right , and [ it is ] pleasing and acceptable to God our Savior ,
54002004	Who wishes all men to be saved and [ increasingly ] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [ divine ] Truth .
54002005	For there [ is only ] one God , and [ only ] one Mediator between God and men , the Man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	Who gave Himself as a ransom for all [ people , a fact that was ] attested to at the right and proper time .
54002007	And of this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( special messenger ) -- I am speaking the truth in Christ , I do not falsify [ when I say this ] -- a teacher of the Gentiles in [ the realm of ] faith and truth .
54002008	I desire therefore that in every place men should pray , without anger or quarreling or resentment or doubt [ in their minds ] , lifting up holy hands .
54002009	Also [ I desire ] that women should adorn themselves modestly and appropriately and sensibly in seemly apparel , not with [ elaborate ] hair arrangement or gold or pearls or expensive clothing ,
54002010	But by doing good deeds ( deeds in themselves good and for the good and advantage of those contacted by them ) , as befits women who profess reverential fear for and devotion to God .
54002011	Let a woman learn in quietness , in entire submissiveness .
54002012	I allow no woman to teach or to have authority over men ; she is to remain in quietness and keep silence [ in religious assemblies ] .
54002013	For Adam was first formed , then Eve ;
54002014	And it was not Adam who was deceived , but [ the ] woman who was deceived and deluded and fell into transgression .
54002015	Nevertheless [ the sentence put upon women of pain in motherhood does not hinder their souls’ salvation , and ] they will be saved [ eternally ] if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control , [ saved indeed ] through the Childbearing or by the birth of the divine Child .
54003001	THE SAYING is true and irrefutable : If any man [ eagerly ] seeks the office of bishop ( superintendent , overseer ) , he desires an excellent task ( work ) .
54003002	Now a bishop ( superintendent , overseer ) must give no grounds for accusation but must be above reproach , the husband of one wife , circumspect and temperate and self-controlled ; [ he must be ] sensible and well behaved and dignified and lead an orderly ( disciplined ) life ; [ he must be ] hospitable [ showing love for and being a friend to the believers , especially strangers or foreigners , and be ] a capable and qualified teacher ,
54003003	Not given to wine , not combative but gentle and considerate , not quarrelsome but forbearing and peaceable , and not a lover of money [ insatiable for wealth and ready to obtain it by questionable means ] .
54003004	He must rule his own household well , keeping his children under control , with true dignity , commanding their respect in every way and keeping them respectful .
54003005	For if a man does not know how to rule his own household , how is he to take care of the church of God ?
54003006	He must not be a new convert , or he may [ develop a beclouded and stupid state of mind ] as the result of pride [ be blinded by conceit , and ] fall into the condemnation that the devil [ once ] did .
54003007	Furthermore , he must have a good reputation and be well thought of by those outside [ the church ] , lest he become involved in slander and incur reproach and fall into the devil’s trap .
54003008	In like manner the deacons [ must be ] worthy of respect , not shifty and double-talkers but sincere in what they say , not given to much wine , not greedy for base gain [ craving wealth and resorting to ignoble and dishonest methods of getting it ] .
54003009	They must possess the mystic secret of the faith [ Christian truth as hidden from ungodly men ] with a clear conscience .
54003010	And let them also be tried and investigated and proved first ; then , if they turn out to be above reproach , let them serve [ as deacons ] .
54003011	[ The ] women likewise must be worthy of respect and serious , not gossipers , but temperate and self-controlled , [ thoroughly ] trustworthy in all things .
54003012	Let deacons be the husbands of but one wife , and let them manage [ their ] children and their own households well .
54003013	For those who perform well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and also gain much confidence and freedom and boldness in the faith which is [ founded on and centers ] in Christ Jesus .
54003014	Although I hope to come to you before long , I am writing these instructions to you so that ,
54003015	If I am detained , you may know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and stay ( the prop and support ) of the Truth .
54003016	And great and important and weighty , we confess , is the hidden truth ( the mystic secret ) of godliness . He [ God ] was made visible in human flesh , justified and vindicated in the [ Holy ] Spirit , was seen by angels , preached among the nations , believed on in the world , [ and ] taken up in glory .
54004001	BUT THE [ Holy ] Spirit distinctly and expressly declares that in latter times some will turn away from the faith , giving attention to deluding and seducing spirits and doctrines that demons teach ,
54004002	Through the hypocrisy and pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared ( cauterized ) ,
54004003	Who forbid people to marry and [ teach them ] to abstain from [ certain kinds of ] foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and have [ an increasingly clear ] knowledge of the truth .
54004004	For everything God has created is good , and nothing is to be thrown away or refused if it is received with thanksgiving .
54004005	For it is hallowed and consecrated by the Word of God and by prayer .
54004006	If you lay all these instructions before the brethren , you will be a worthy steward and a good minister of Christ Jesus , ever nourishing your own self on the truths of the faith and of the good [ Christian ] instruction which you have closely followed .
54004007	But refuse and avoid irreverent legends ( profane and impure and godless fictions , mere grandmothers’ tales ) and silly myths , and express your disapproval of them . Train yourself toward godliness ( piety ) , [ keeping yourself spiritually fit ] .
54004008	For physical training is of some value ( useful for a little ) , but godliness ( spiritual training ) is useful and of value in everything and in every way , for it holds promise for the present life and also for the life which is to come .
54004009	This saying is reliable and worthy of complete acceptance by everybody .
54004010	With a view to this we toil and strive , [ yes and ] suffer reproach , because we have [ fixed our ] hope on the living God , Who is the Savior ( Preserver , Maintainer , Deliverer ) of all men , especially of those who believe ( trust in , rely on , and adhere to Him ) .
54004011	Continue to command these things and to teach them .
54004012	Let no one despise or think less of you because of your youth , but be an example ( pattern ) for the believers in speech , in conduct , in love , in faith , and in purity .
54004013	Till I come , devote yourself to [ public and private ] reading , to exhortation ( preaching and personal appeals ) , and to teaching and instilling doctrine .
54004014	Do not neglect the gift which is in you , [ that special inward endowment ] which was directly imparted to you [ by the Holy Spirit ] by prophetic utterance when the elders laid their hands upon you [ at your ordination ] .
54004015	Practice and cultivate and meditate upon these duties ; throw yourself wholly into them [ as your ministry ] , so that your progress may be evident to everybody .
54004016	Look well to yourself [ to your own personality ] and to [ your ] teaching ; persevere in these things [ hold to them ] , for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
54005001	DO NOT sharply censure or rebuke an older man , but entreat and plead with him as [ you would with ] a father . Treat younger men like brothers ;
54005002	[ Treat ] older women like mothers [ and ] younger women like sisters , in all purity .
54005003	[ Always ] treat with great consideration and give aid to those who are truly widowed ( solitary and without support ) .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , see to it that these are first made to understand that it is their religious duty [ to defray their natural obligation to those ] at home , and make return to their parents or grandparents [ for all their care by contributing to their maintenance ] , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
54005005	Now [ a woman ] who is a real widow and is left entirely alone and desolate has fixed her hope on God and perseveres in supplications and prayers night and day ,
54005006	Whereas she who lives in pleasure and self-gratification [ giving herself up to luxury and self-indulgence ] is dead even while she [ still ] lives .
54005007	Charge [ the people ] thus , so that they may be without reproach and blameless .
54005008	If anyone fails to provide for his relatives , and especially for those of his own family , he has disowned the faith [ by failing to accompany it with fruits ] and is worse than an unbeliever [ who performs his obligation in these matters ] .
54005009	Let no one be put on the roll of widows [ who are to receive church support ] who is under sixty years of age or who has been the wife of more than one man ;
54005010	And she must have a reputation for good deeds , as one who has brought up children , who has practiced hospitality to strangers [ of the brotherhood ] , washed the feet of the saints , helped to relieve the distressed , [ and ] devoted herself diligently to doing good in every way .
54005011	But refuse [ to enroll on this list the ] younger widows , for when they become restive and their natural desires grow strong , they withdraw themselves against Christ [ and ] wish to marry [ again ] .
54005012	And so they incur condemnation for having set aside and slighted their previous pledge .
54005013	Moreover , as they go about from house to house , they learn to be idlers , and not only idlers , but gossips and busybodies , saying what they should not say and talking of things they should not mention .
54005014	So I would have younger [ widows ] marry , bear children , guide the household , [ and ] not give opponents of the faith occasion for slander or reproach .
54005015	For already some [ widows ] have turned aside after Satan .
54005016	If any believing woman or believing man has [ relatives or persons in the household who are ] widows , let him relieve them ; let the church not be burdened [ with them ] , so that it may [ be free to ] assist those who are truly widows ( those who are all alone and are dependent ) .
54005017	Let the elders who perform the duties of their office well be considered doubly worthy of honor [ and of adequate financial support ] , especially those who labor faithfully in preaching and teaching .
54005018	For the Scripture says , You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain , and again , The laborer is worthy of his hire .
54005019	Listen to no accusation [ presented before a judge ] against an elder unless it is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses .
54005020	As for those who are guilty and persist in sin , rebuke and admonish them in the presence of all , so that the rest may be warned and stand in wholesome awe and fear .
54005021	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the chosen angels that you guard and keep [ these rules ] without personal prejudice or favor , doing nothing from partiality .
54005022	Do not be in a hurry in the laying on of hands [ giving the sanction of the church too hastily in reinstating expelled offenders or in ordination in questionable cases ] , nor share or participate in another man’s sins ; keep yourself pure .
54005023	Drink water no longer exclusively , but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses .
54005024	The sins of some men are conspicuous ( openly evident to all eyes ) , going before them to the judgment [ seat ] and proclaiming their sentence in advance ; but the sins of others appear later [ following the offender to the bar of judgment and coming into view there ] .
54005025	So also , good deeds are evident and conspicuous , and even when they are not , they cannot remain hidden [ indefinitely ] .
54006001	LET ALL who are under the yoke as bond servants esteem their own [ personal ] masters worthy of honor and fullest respect , so that the name of God and the teaching [ about Him ] may not be brought into disrepute and blasphemed .
54006002	Let those who have believing masters not be disrespectful or scornful [ to them ] on the grounds that they are brothers [ in Christ ] ; rather , they should serve [ them all the better ] because those who benefit by their kindly service are believers and beloved . Teach and urge these duties .
54006003	But if anyone teaches otherwise and does not assent to the sound and wholesome messages of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and the teaching which is in agreement with godliness ( piety toward God ) ,
54006004	He is puffed up with pride and stupefied with conceit , [ although he is ] woefully ignorant . He has a morbid fondness for controversy and disputes and strife about words , which result in ( produce ) envy and jealousy , quarrels and dissension , abuse and insults and slander , and base suspicions ,
54006005	And protracted wrangling and wearing discussion and perpetual friction among men who are corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth , who imagine that godliness or righteousness is a source of profit [ a moneymaking business , a means of livelihood ] . From such withdraw .
54006006	[ And it is , indeed , a source of immense profit , for ] godliness accompanied with contentment ( that contentment which is a sense of inward sufficiency ) is great and abundant gain .
54006007	For we brought nothing into the world , and obviously we cannot take anything out of the world ;
54006008	But if we have food and clothing , with these we shall be content ( satisfied ) .
54006009	But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish ( useless , godless ) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction and miserable perishing .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all evils ; it is through this craving that some have been led astray and have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves through with many acute [ mental ] pangs .
54006011	But as for you , O man of God , flee from all these things ; aim at and pursue righteousness ( right standing with God and true goodness ) , godliness ( which is the loving fear of God and being Christlike ) , faith , love , steadfastness ( patience ) , and gentleness of heart .
54006012	Fight the good fight of the faith ; lay hold of the eternal life to which you were summoned and [ for which ] you confessed the good confession [ of faith ] before many witnesses .
54006013	In the presence of God , Who preserves alive all living things , and of Christ Jesus , Who in His testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession , I [ solemnly ] charge you
54006014	To keep all His precepts unsullied and flawless , irreproachable , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) ,
54006015	Which [ appearing ] will be shown forth in His own proper time by the blessed , only Sovereign ( Ruler ) , the King of kings and the Lord of lords ,
54006016	Who alone has immortality [ in the sense of exemption from every kind of death ] and lives in unapproachable light , Whom no man has ever seen or can see . Unto Him be honor and everlasting power and dominion . Amen ( so be it ) .
54006017	As for the rich in this world , charge them not to be proud and arrogant and contemptuous of others , nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches , but on God , Who richly and ceaselessly provides us with everything for [ our ] enjoyment .
54006018	[ Charge them ] to do good , to be rich in good works , to be liberal and generous of heart , ready to share [ with others ] ,
54006019	In this way laying up for themselves [ the riches that endure forever as ] a good foundation for the future , so that they may grasp that which is life indeed .
54006020	O Timothy , guard and keep the deposit entrusted [ to you ] ! Turn away from the irreverent babble and godless chatter , with the vain and empty and worldly phrases , and the subtleties and the contradictions in what is falsely called knowledge and spiritual illumination .
54006021	[ For ] by making such profession some have erred ( missed the mark ) as regards the faith . Grace ( divine favor and blessing ) be with you all ! Amen ( so be it ) .
55001001	PAUL , AN apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus by the will of God , according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	To Timothy , [ my ] beloved child : Grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) , mercy , and [ heart ] peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord !
55001003	I thank God Whom I worship with a pure conscience , in the spirit of my fathers , when without ceasing I remember you night and day in my prayers ,
55001004	And when , as I recall your tears , I yearn to see you so that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	I am calling up memories of your sincere and unqualified faith ( the leaning of your entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) , [ a faith ] that first lived permanently in [ the heart of ] your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now , I am [ fully ] persuaded , [ dwells ] in you also .
55001006	That is why I would remind you to stir up ( rekindle the embers of , fan the flame of , and keep burning ) the [ gracious ] gift of God , [ the inner fire ] that is in you by means of the laying on of my hands [ with those of the elders at your ordination ] .
55001007	For God did not give us a spirit of timidity ( of cowardice , of craven and cringing and fawning fear ) , but [ He has given us a spirit ] of power and of love and of calm and well-balanced mind and discipline and self-control .
55001008	Do not blush or be ashamed then , to testify to and for our Lord , nor of me , a prisoner for His sake , but [ with me ] take your share of the suffering [ to which the preaching ] of the Gospel [ may expose you , and do it ] in the power of God .
55001009	[ For it is He ] Who delivered and saved us and called us with a calling in itself holy and leading to holiness [ to a life of consecration , a vocation of holiness ] ; [ He did it ] not because of anything of merit that we have done , but because of and to further His own purpose and grace ( unmerited favor ) which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began [ eternal ages ago ] .
55001010	[ It is that purpose and grace ] which He now has made known and has fully disclosed and made real [ to us ] through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus , Who annulled death and made it of no effect and brought life and immortality ( immunity from eternal death ) to light through the Gospel .
55001011	For [ the proclaiming of ] this [ Gospel ] I was appointed a herald ( preacher ) and an apostle ( special messenger ) and a teacher of the Gentiles .
55001012	And this is why I am suffering as I do . Still I am not ashamed , for I know ( perceive , have knowledge of , and am acquainted with ) Him Whom I have believed ( adhered to and trusted in and relied on ) , and I am [ positively ] persuaded that He is able to guard and keep that which has been entrusted to me and which I have committed [ to Him ] until that day .
55001013	Hold fast and follow the pattern of wholesome and sound teaching which you have heard from me , in [ all ] the faith and love which are [ for us ] in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Guard and keep [ with the greatest care ] the precious and excellently adapted [ Truth ] which has been entrusted [ to you ] , by the [ help of the ] Holy Spirit Who makes His home in us .
55001015	You already know that all who are in Asia turned away and forsook me , Phygelus and Hermogenes among them .
55001016	May the Lord grant [ His ] mercy to the family of Onesiphorus , for he often showed me kindness and ministered to my needs [ comforting and reviving and bracing me like fresh air ] ! He was not ashamed of my chains and imprisonment [ for Christ’s sake ] .
55001017	No , rather when he reached Rome , he searched diligently and eagerly for me and found me .
55001018	May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord on that [ great ] day ! And you know how many things he did for me and what a help he was at Ephesus [ you know better than I can tell you ] .
55002001	SO YOU , my son , be strong ( strengthened inwardly ) in the grace ( spiritual blessing ) that is [ to be found only ] in Christ Jesus .
55002002	And the [ instructions ] which you have heard from me along with many witnesses , transmit and entrust [ as a deposit ] to reliable and faithful men who will be competent and qualified to teach others also .
55002003	Take [ with me ] your share of the hardships and suffering [ which you are called to endure ] as a good ( first-class ) soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No soldier when in service gets entangled in the enterprises of [ civilian ] life ; his aim is to satisfy and please the one who enlisted him .
55002005	And if anyone enters competitive games , he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully ( fairly , according to the rules laid down ) .
55002006	[ It is ] the hard-working farmer [ who labors to produce ] who must be the first partaker of the fruits .
55002007	Think over these things I am saying [ understand them and grasp their application ] , for the Lord will grant you full insight and understanding in everything .
55002008	Constantly keep in mind Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) [ as ] risen from the dead , [ as the prophesied King ] descended from David , according to the good news ( the Gospel ) that I preach .
55002009	For that [ Gospel ] I am suffering affliction and even wearing chains like a criminal . But the Word of God is not chained or imprisoned !
55002010	Therefore I [ am ready to ] persevere and stand my ground with patience and endure everything for the sake of the elect [ God’s chosen ] , so that they too may obtain [ the ] salvation which is in Christ Jesus , with [ the reward of ] eternal glory .
55002011	The saying is sure and worthy of confidence : If we have died with Him , we shall also live with Him .
55002012	If we endure , we shall also reign with Him . If we deny and disown and reject Him , He will also deny and disown and reject us .
55002013	If we are faithless [ do not believe and are untrue to Him ] , He remains true ( faithful to His Word and His righteous character ) , for He cannot deny Himself .
55002014	Remind [ the people ] of these facts and [ solemnly ] charge them in the presence of the Lord to avoid petty controversy over words , which does no good but upsets and undermines the faith of the hearers .
55002015	Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved ( tested by trial ) , a workman who has no cause to be ashamed , correctly analyzing and accurately dividing [ rightly handling and skillfully teaching ] the Word of Truth .
55002016	But avoid all empty ( vain , useless , idle ) talk , for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness .
55002017	And their teaching [ will devour ; it ] will eat its way like cancer or spread like gangrene . So it is with Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
55002018	Who have missed the mark and swerved from the truth by arguing that the resurrection has already taken place . They are undermining the faith of some .
55002019	But the firm foundation of ( laid by ) God stands , sure and unshaken , bearing this seal ( inscription ) : The Lord knows those who are His , and , Let everyone who names [ himself by ] the name of the Lord give up all iniquity and stand aloof from it .
55002020	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver , but also [ utensils ] of wood and earthenware , and some for honorable and noble [ use ] and some for menial and ignoble [ use ] .
55002021	So whoever cleanses himself [ from what is ignoble and unclean , who separates himself from contact with contaminating and corrupting influences ] will [ then himself ] be a vessel set apart and useful for honorable and noble purposes , consecrated and profitable to the Master , fit and ready for any good work .
55002022	Shun youthful lusts and flee from them , and aim at and pursue righteousness ( all that is virtuous and good , right living , conformity to the will of God in thought , word , and deed ) ; [ and aim at and pursue ] faith , love , [ and ] peace ( harmony and concord with others ) in fellowship with all [ Christians ] , who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart .
55002023	But refuse ( shut your mind against , have nothing to do with ) trifling ( ill-informed , unedifying , stupid ) controversies over ignorant questionings , for you know that they foster strife and breed quarrels .
55002024	And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome ( fighting and contending ) . Instead , he must be kindly to everyone and mild-tempered [ preserving the bond of peace ] ; he must be a skilled and suitable teacher , patient and forbearing and willing to suffer wrong .
55002025	He must correct his opponents with courtesy and gentleness , in the hope that God may grant that they will repent and come to know the Truth [ that they will perceive and recognize and become accurately acquainted with and acknowledge it ] ,
55002026	And that they may come to their senses [ and ] escape out of the snare of the devil , having been held captive by him , [ henceforth ] to do His [ God’s ] will .
55003001	BUT UNDERSTAND this , that in the last days will come ( set in ) perilous times of great stress and trouble [ hard to deal with and hard to bear ] .
55003002	For people will be lovers of self and [ utterly ] self-centered , lovers of money and aroused by an inordinate [ greedy ] desire for wealth , proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters . They will be abusive ( blasphemous , scoffing ) , disobedient to parents , ungrateful , unholy and profane .
55003003	[ They will be ] without natural [ human ] affection ( callous and inhuman ) , relentless ( admitting of no truce or appeasement ) ; [ they will be ] slanderers ( false accusers , troublemakers ) , intemperate and loose in morals and conduct , uncontrolled and fierce , haters of good .
55003004	[ They will be ] treacherous [ betrayers ] , rash , [ and ] inflated with self-conceit . [ They will be ] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of God .
55003005	For [ although ] they hold a form of piety ( true religion ) , they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it [ their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession ] . Avoid [ all ] such people [ turn away from them ] .
55003006	For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly and weak-natured and spiritually dwarfed women , loaded down with [ the burden of their ] sins [ and easily ] swayed and led away by various evil desires and seductive impulses .
55003007	[ These weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them ] ; they are forever inquiring and getting information , but are never able to arrive at a recognition and knowledge of the Truth .
55003008	Now just as Jannes and Jambres were hostile to and resisted Moses , so these men also are hostile to and oppose the Truth . They have depraved and distorted minds , and are reprobate and counterfeit and to be rejected as far as the faith is concerned .
55003009	But they will not get very far , for their rash folly will become obvious to everybody , as was that of those [ magicians mentioned ] .
55003010	Now you have closely observed and diligently followed my teaching , conduct , purpose in life , faith , patience , love , steadfastness ,
55003011	Persecutions , sufferings -- such as occurred to me at Antioch , at Iconium , and at Lystra , persecutions I endured , but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
55003012	Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a devoted and godly life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution [ will be made to suffer because of their religious stand ] .
55003013	But wicked men and imposters will go on from bad to worse , deceiving and leading astray others and being deceived and led astray themselves .
55003014	But as for you , continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you are convinced , knowing from whom you learned [ them ] ,
55003015	And how from your childhood you have had a knowledge of and been acquainted with the sacred Writings , which are able to instruct you and give you the understanding for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus [ through the leaning of the entire human personality on God in Christ Jesus in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] .
55003016	Every Scripture is God-breathed ( given by His inspiration ) and profitable for instruction , for reproof and conviction of sin , for correction of error and discipline in obedience , [ and ] for training in righteousness ( in holy living , in conformity to God’s will in thought , purpose , and action ) ,
55003017	So that the man of God may be complete and proficient , well fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work .
55004001	I CHARGE [ you ] in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , Who is to judge the living and the dead , and by ( in the light of ) His coming and His kingdom :
55004002	Herald and preach the Word ! Keep your sense of urgency [ stand by , be at hand and ready ] , whether the opportunity seems to be favorable or unfavorable . [ Whether it is convenient or inconvenient , whether it is welcome or unwelcome , you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what way their lives are wrong . ] And convince them , rebuking and correcting , warning and urging and encouraging them , being unflagging and inexhaustible in patience and teaching .
55004003	For the time is coming when [ people ] will not tolerate ( endure ) sound and wholesome instruction , but , having ears itching [ for something pleasing and gratifying ] , they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number , chosen to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors they hold ,
55004004	And will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and man-made fictions .
55004005	As for you , be calm and cool and steady , accept and suffer unflinchingly every hardship , do the work of an evangelist , fully perform all the duties of your ministry .
55004006	For I am already about to be sacrificed [ my life is about to be poured out as a drink offering ] ; the time of my [ spirit’s ] release [ from the body ] is at hand and I will soon go free .
55004007	I have fought the good ( worthy , honorable , and noble ) fight , I have finished the race , I have kept ( firmly held ) the faith .
55004008	[ As to what remains ] henceforth there is laid up for me the [ victor’s ] crown of righteousness [ for being right with God and doing right ] , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me and recompense me on that [ great ] day -- and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved and yearned for and welcomed His appearing ( His return ) .
55004009	Make every effort to come to me soon .
55004010	For Demas has deserted me for love of this present world and has gone to Thessalonica ; Crescens [ has gone ] to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Luke alone is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , for he is very helpful to me for the ministry .
55004012	Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .
55004013	[ When ] you come , bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus , also the books , especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the coppersmith did me great wrongs . The Lord will pay him back for his actions .
55004015	Beware of him yourself , for he opposed and resisted our message very strongly and exceedingly .
55004016	At my first trial no one acted in my defense [ as my advocate ] or took my part or [ even ] stood with me , but all forsook me . May it not be charged against them !
55004017	But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me , so that through me the [ Gospel ] message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it . So I was delivered out of the jaws of the lion .
55004018	[ And indeed ] the Lord will certainly deliver and draw me to Himself from every assault of evil . He will preserve and bring me safe unto His heavenly kingdom . To Him be the glory forever and ever . Amen ( so be it ) .
55004019	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and to the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed on at Corinth , but Trophimus I left ill at Miletus .
55004021	Do hasten and try your best to come to me before winter . Eubulus wishes to be remembered to you , as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren .
55004022	The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Grace ( God’s favor and blessing ) be with you . Amen ( so be it ) .
56001001	PAUL , A bond servant of God and an apostle ( a special messenger ) of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) to stimulate and promote the faith of God’s chosen ones and to lead them on to accurate discernment and recognition of and acquaintance with the Truth which belongs to and harmonizes with and tends to godliness ,
56001002	[ Resting ] in the hope of eternal life , [ life ] which the ever truthful God Who cannot deceive promised before the world or the ages of time began .
56001003	And [ now ] in His own appointed time He has made manifest ( made known ) His Word and revealed it as His message through the preaching entrusted to me by command of God our Savior ;
56001004	To Titus , my true child according to a common ( general ) faith : Grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) and [ heart ] peace from God the Father and the Lord Christ Jesus our Savior .
56001005	For this reason I left you [ behind ] in Crete , that you might set right what was defective and finish what was left undone , and that you might appoint elders and set them over the churches ( assemblies ) in every city as I directed you .
56001006	[ These elders should be ] men who are of unquestionable integrity and are irreproachable , the husband of [ but ] one wife , whose children are [ well trained and are ] believers , not open to the accusation of being loose in morals and conduct or unruly and disorderly .
56001007	For the bishop ( an overseer ) as God’s steward must be blameless , not self-willed or arrogant or presumptuous ; he must not be quick-tempered or given to drink or pugnacious ( brawling , violent ) ; he must not be grasping and greedy for filthy lucre ( financial gain ) ;
56001008	But he must be hospitable ( loving and a friend to believers , especially to strangers and foreigners ) ; [ he must be ] a lover of goodness [ of good people and good things ] , sober-minded ( sensible , discreet ) , upright and fair-minded , a devout man and religiously correct , temperate and keeping himself in hand .
56001009	He must hold fast to the sure and trustworthy Word of God as he was taught it , so that he may be able both to give stimulating instruction and encouragement in sound ( wholesome ) doctrine and to refute and convict those who contradict and oppose it [ showing the wayward their error ] .
56001010	For there are many disorderly and unruly men who are idle ( vain , empty ) and misleading talkers and self-deceivers and deceivers of others . [ This is true ] especially of those of the circumcision party [ who have come over from Judaism ] .
56001011	Their mouths must be stopped , for they are mentally distressing and subverting whole families by teaching what they ought not to teach , for the purpose of getting base advantage and disreputable gain .
56001012	One of their [ very ] number , a prophet of their own , said , Cretans are always liars , hurtful beasts , idle and lazy gluttons .
56001013	And this account of them is [ really ] true . Because it is [ true ] , rebuke them sharply [ deal sternly , even severely with them ] , so that they may be sound in the faith and free from error ,
56001014	[ And may show their soundness by ] ceasing to give attention to Jewish myths and fables or to rules [ laid down ] by [ mere ] men who reject and turn their backs on the Truth .
56001015	To the pure [ in heart and conscience ] all things are pure , but to the defiled and corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure ; their very minds and consciences are defiled and polluted .
56001016	They profess to know God [ to recognize , perceive , and be acquainted with Him ] , but deny and disown and renounce Him by what they do ; they are detestable and loathsome , unbelieving and disobedient and disloyal and rebellious , and [ they are ] unfit and worthless for good work ( deed or enterprise ) of any kind .
56002001	BUT [ as for ] you , teach what is fitting and becoming to sound ( wholesome ) doctrine [ the character and right living that identify true Christians ] .
56002002	Urge the older men to be temperate , venerable ( serious ) , sensible , self-controlled , and sound in the faith , in the love , and in the steadfastness and patience [ of Christ ] .
56002003	Bid the older women similarly to be reverent and devout in their deportment as becomes those engaged in sacred service , not slanderers or slaves to drink . They are to give good counsel and be teachers of what is right and noble ,
56002004	So that they will wisely train the young women to be sane and sober of mind ( temperate , disciplined ) and to love their husbands and their children ,
56002005	To be self-controlled , chaste , homemakers , good-natured ( kindhearted ) , adapting and subordinating themselves to their husbands , that the word of God may not be exposed to reproach ( blasphemed or discredited ) .
56002006	In a similar way , urge the younger men to be self-restrained and to behave prudently [ taking life seriously ] .
56002007	And show your own self in all respects to be a pattern and a model of good deeds and works , teaching what is unadulterated , showing gravity [ having the strictest regard for truth and purity of motive ] , with dignity and seriousness .
56002008	And let your instruction be sound and fit and wise and wholesome , vigorous and irrefutable and above censure , so that the opponent may be put to shame , finding nothing discrediting or evil to say about us .
56002009	[ Tell ] bond servants to be submissive to their masters , to be pleasing and give satisfaction in every way . [ Warn them ] not to talk back or contradict ,
56002010	Nor to steal by taking things of small value , but to prove themselves truly loyal and entirely reliable and faithful throughout , so that in everything they may be an ornament and do credit to the teaching [ which is ] from and about God our Savior .
56002011	For the grace of God ( His unmerited favor and blessing ) has come forward ( appeared ) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind .
56002012	It has trained us to reject and renounce all ungodliness ( irreligion ) and worldly ( passionate ) desires , to live discreet ( temperate , self-controlled ) , upright , devout ( spiritually whole ) lives in this present world ,
56002013	Awaiting and looking for the [ fulfillment , the realization of our ] blessed hope , even the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) ,
56002014	Who gave Himself on our behalf that He might redeem us ( purchase our freedom ) from all iniquity and purify for Himself a people [ to be peculiarly His own , people who are ] eager and enthusiastic about [ living a life that is good and filled with ] beneficial deeds .
56002015	Tell [ them all ] these things . Urge ( advise , encourage , warn ) and rebuke with full authority . Let no one despise or disregard or think little of you [ conduct yourself and your teaching so as to command respect ] .
56003001	REMIND PEOPLE to be submissive to [ their ] magistrates and authorities , to be obedient , to be prepared and willing to do any upright and honorable work ,
56003002	To slander or abuse or speak evil of no one , to avoid being contentious , to be forbearing ( yielding , gentle , and conciliatory ) , and to show unqualified courtesy toward everybody .
56003003	For we also were once thoughtless and senseless , obstinate and disobedient , deluded and misled ; [ we too were once ] slaves to all sorts of cravings and pleasures , wasting our days in malice and jealousy and envy , hateful ( hated , detestable ) and hating one another .
56003004	But when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Savior to man [ as man ] appeared ,
56003005	He saved us , not because of any works of righteousness that we had done , but because of His own pity and mercy , by [ the ] cleansing [ bath ] of the new birth ( regeneration ) and renewing of the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	Which He poured out [ so ] richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior .
56003007	[ And He did it in order ] that we might be justified by His grace ( by His favor , wholly undeserved ) , [ that we might be acknowledged and counted as conformed to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action ] , and that we might become heirs of eternal life according to [ our ] hope .
56003008	This message is most trustworthy , and concerning these things I want you to insist steadfastly , so that those who have believed in ( trusted in , relied on ) God may be careful to apply themselves to honorable occupations and to doing good , for such things are [ not only ] excellent and right [ in themselves ] , but [ they are ] good and profitable for the people .
56003009	But avoid stupid and foolish controversies and genealogies and dissensions and wrangling about the Law , for they are unprofitable and futile .
56003010	[ As for ] a man who is factious [ a heretical sectarian and cause of divisions ] , after admonishing him a first and second time , reject [ him from your fellowship and have nothing more to do with him ] ,
56003011	Well aware that such a person has utterly changed ( is perverted and corrupted ) ; he goes on sinning [ though he ] is convicted of guilt and self-condemned .
56003012	When I send Artemas or [ perhaps ] Tychicus to you , lose no time but make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	Do your utmost to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way ; see that they want for ( lack ) nothing .
56003014	And let our own [ people really ] learn to apply themselves to good deeds ( to honest labor and honorable employment ) , so that they may be able to meet necessary demands whenever the occasion may require and not be living idle and uncultivated and unfruitful lives .
56003015	All who are with me wish to be remembered to you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace ( God’s favor and blessing ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) .
57001001	PAUL , A prisoner [ for the sake ] of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , and our brother Timothy , to Philemon our dearly beloved sharer with us in our work ,
57001002	And to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier [ in the Christian warfare ] , and to the church [ assembly that meets ] in your house :
57001003	Grace ( spiritual blessing and favor ) be to all of you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
57001004	I give thanks to my God for you always when I mention you in my prayers ,
57001005	Because I continue to hear of your love and of your loyal faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and [ which you show ] toward all the saints ( God’s consecrated people ) .
57001006	[ And I pray ] that the participation in and sharing of your faith may produce and promote full recognition and appreciation and understanding and precise knowledge of every good [ thing ] that is ours in [ our identification with ] Christ Jesus [ and unto His glory ] .
57001007	For I have derived great joy and comfort and encouragement from your love , because the hearts of the saints [ who are your fellow Christians ] have been cheered and refreshed through you , [ my ] brother .
57001008	Therefore , though I have abundant boldness in Christ to charge you to do what is fitting and required and your duty to do ,
57001009	Yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you just for what I am -- I , Paul , an ambassador [ of Christ Jesus ] and an old man and now a prisoner for His sake also --
57001010	I appeal to you for my [ own spiritual ] child , Onesimus [ meaning profitable ] , whom I have begotten [ in the faith ] while a captive in these chains .
57001011	Once he was unprofitable to you , but now he is indeed profitable to you as well as to me .
57001012	I am sending him back to you in his own person , [ and it is like sending ] my very heart .
57001013	I would have chosen to keep him with me , in order that he might minister to my needs in your stead during my imprisonment for the Gospel’s sake .
57001014	But it has been my wish to do nothing about it without first consulting you and getting your consent , in order that your benevolence might not seem to be the result of compulsion or of pressure but might be voluntary [ on your part ] .
57001015	Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated [ from you ] for a while , that you might have him back as yours forever ,
57001016	Not as a slave any longer but as [ something ] more than a slave , as a brother [ Christian ] , especially dear to me but how much more to you , both in the flesh [ as a servant ] and in the Lord [ as a fellow believer ] .
57001017	If then you consider me a partner and a comrade in fellowship , welcome and receive him as you would [ welcome and receive ] me .
57001018	And if he has done you any wrong in any way or owes anything [ to you ] , charge that to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , write it with my own hand , I promise to repay it [ in full ] -- and that is to say nothing [ of the fact ] that you owe me your very self !
57001020	Yes , brother , let me have some profit from you in the Lord . Cheer and refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	I write to you [ perfectly ] confident of your obedient compliance , knowing that you will do even more than I ask .
57001022	At the same time prepare a guest room [ in expectation of extending your hospitality ] to me , for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted [ the gracious privilege of coming ] to you .
57001023	Greetings to you from Epaphras , my fellow prisoner here in [ the cause of ] Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) ,
57001024	And [ from ] Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	The grace ( blessing and favor ) of the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with your spirit . Amen ( so be it ) .
58001001	IN MANY separate revelations [ each of which set forth a portion of the Truth ] and in different ways God spoke of old to [ our ] forefathers in and by the prophets ,
58001002	[ But ] in the last of these days He has spoken to us in [ the person of a ] Son , Whom He appointed Heir and lawful Owner of all things , also by and through Whom He created the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of time [ He made , produced , built , operated , and arranged them in order ] .
58001003	He is the sole expression of the glory of God [ the Light-being , the out-raying or radiance of the divine ] , and He is the perfect imprint and very image of [ God’s ] nature , upholding and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by His mighty word of power . When He had by offering Himself accomplished our cleansing of sins and riddance of guilt , He sat down at the right hand of the divine Majesty on high ,
58001004	[ Taking a place and rank by which ] He Himself became as much superior to angels as the glorious Name ( title ) which He has inherited is different from and more excellent than theirs .
58001005	For to which of the angels did [ God ] ever say , You are My Son , today I have begotten You [ established You in an official Sonship relation , with kingly dignity ] ? And again , I will be to Him a Father , and He will be to Me a Son ?
58001006	Moreover , when He brings the firstborn Son again into the habitable world , He says , Let all the angels of God worship Him .
58001007	Referring to the angels He says , [ God ] Who makes His angels winds and His ministering servants flames of fire ;
58001008	But as to the Son , He says to Him , Your throne , O God , is forever and ever ( to the ages of the ages ) , and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of absolute righteousness ( of justice and straightforwardness ) .
58001009	You have loved righteousness [ You have delighted in integrity , virtue , and uprightness in purpose , thought , and action ] and You have hated lawlessness ( injustice and iniquity ) . Therefore God , [ even ] Your God ( Godhead ) , has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy and gladness above and beyond Your companions .
58001010	And [ further ] , You , Lord , did lay the foundation of the earth in the beginning , and the heavens are the works of Your hands .
58001011	They will perish , but You remain and continue permanently ; they will all grow old and wear out like a garment .
58001012	Like a mantle [ thrown about one’s self ] You will roll them up , and they will be changed and replaced by others . But You remain the same , and Your years will never end nor come to failure .
58001013	Besides , to which of the angels has He ever said , Sit at My right hand [ associated with Me in My royal dignity ] till I make your enemies a stool for your feet ?
58001014	Are not the angels all ministering spirits ( servants ) sent out in the service [ of God for the assistance ] of those who are to inherit salvation ?
58002001	SINCE ALL this is true , we ought to pay much closer attention than ever to the truths that we have heard , lest in any way we drift past [ them ] and slip away .
58002002	For if the message given through angels [ the Law spoken by them to Moses ] was authentic and proved sure , and every violation and disobedience received an appropriate ( just and adequate ) penalty ,
58002003	How shall we escape [ appropriate retribution ] if we neglect and refuse to pay attention to such a great salvation [ as is now offered to us , letting it drift past us forever ] ? For it was declared at first by the Lord [ Himself ] , and it was confirmed to us and proved to be real and genuine by those who personally heard [ Him speak ] .
58002004	[ Besides this evidence ] it was also established and plainly endorsed by God , Who showed His approval of it by signs and wonders and various miraculous manifestations of [ His ] power and by imparting the gifts of the Holy Spirit [ to the believers ] according to His own will .
58002005	For it was not to angels that God subjected the habitable world of the future , of which we are speaking .
58002006	It has been solemnly and earnestly said in a certain place , What is man that You are mindful of him , or the son of man that You graciously and helpfully care for and visit and look after him ?
58002007	For some little time You have ranked him lower than and inferior to the angels ; You have crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands ,
58002008	For You have put everything in subjection under his feet . Now in putting everything in subjection to man , He left nothing outside [ of man’s ] control . But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him [ man ] .
58002009	But we are able to see Jesus , Who was ranked lower than the angels for a little while , crowned with glory and honor because of His having suffered death , in order that by the grace ( unmerited favor ) of God [ to us sinners ] He might experience death for every individual person .
58002010	For it was an act worthy [ of God ] and fitting [ to the divine nature ] that He , for Whose sake and by Whom all things have their existence , in bringing many sons into glory , should make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect [ should bring to maturity the human experience necessary to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest ] through suffering .
58002011	For both He Who sanctifies [ making men holy ] and those who are sanctified all have one [ Father ] . For this reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren ;
58002012	For He says , I will declare Your [ the Father’s ] name to My brethren ; in the midst of the [ worshiping ] congregation I will sing hymns of praise to You .
58002013	And again He says , My trust and assured reliance and confident hope shall be fixed in Him . And yet again , Here I am , I and the children whom God has given Me .
58002014	Since , therefore , [ these His ] children share in flesh and blood [ in the physical nature of human beings ] , He [ Himself ] in a similar manner partook of the same [ nature ] , that by [ going through ] death He might bring to nought and make of no effect him who had the power of death -- that is , the devil --
58002015	And also that He might deliver and completely set free all those who through the [ haunting ] fear of death were held in bondage throughout the whole course of their lives .
58002016	For , as we all know , He [ Christ ] did not take hold of angels [ the fallen angels , to give them a helping and delivering hand ] , but He did take hold of [ the fallen ] descendants of Abraham [ to reach out to them a helping and delivering hand ] .
58002017	So it is evident that it was essential that He be made like His brethren in every respect , in order that He might become a merciful ( sympathetic ) and faithful High Priest in the things related to God , to make atonement and propitiation for the people’s sins .
58002018	For because He Himself [ in His humanity ] has suffered in being tempted ( tested and tried ) , He is able [ immediately ] to run to the cry of ( assist , relieve ) those who are being tempted and tested and tried [ and who therefore are being exposed to suffering ] .
58003001	SO THEN , brethren , consecrated and set apart for God , who share in the heavenly calling , [ thoughtfully and attentively ] consider Jesus , the Apostle and High Priest Whom we confessed [ as ours when we embraced the Christian faith ] .
58003002	[ See how ] faithful He was to Him Who appointed Him [ Apostle and High Priest ] , as Moses was also faithful in the whole house [ of God ] .
58003003	Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater honor and glory than Moses , just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house [ itself ] .
58003004	For [ of course ] every house is built and furnished by someone , but the Builder of all things and the Furnisher [ of the entire equipment of all things ] is God .
58003005	And Moses certainly was faithful in the administration of all God’s house [ but it was only ] as a ministering servant . [ In his entire ministry he was but ] a testimony to the things which were to be spoken [ the revelations to be given afterward in Christ ] .
58003006	But Christ ( the Messiah ) was faithful over His [ own Father’s ] house as a Son [ and Master of it ] . And it is we who are [ now members ] of this house , if we hold fast and firm to the end our joyful and exultant confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [ in Christ ] .
58003007	Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says : Today , if you will hear His voice ,
58003008	Do not harden your hearts , as [ happened ] in the rebellion [ of Israel ] and their provocation and embitterment [ of Me ] in the day of testing in the wilderness ,
58003009	Where your fathers tried [ My patience ] and tested [ My forbearance ] and found I stood their test , and they saw My works for forty years .
58003010	And so I was provoked ( displeased and sorely grieved ) with that generation , and said , They always err and are led astray in their hearts , and they have not perceived or recognized My ways and become progressively better and more experimentally and intimately acquainted with them .
58003011	Accordingly , I swore in My wrath and indignation , They shall not enter into My rest .
58003012	[ Therefore beware ] brethren , take care , lest there be in any one of you a wicked , unbelieving heart [ which refuses to cleave to , trust in , and rely on Him ] , leading you to turn away and desert or stand aloof from the living God .
58003013	But instead warn ( admonish , urge , and encourage ) one another every day , as long as it is called Today , that none of you may be hardened [ into settled rebellion ] by the deceitfulness of sin [ by the fraudulence , the stratagem , the trickery which the delusive glamor of his sin may play on him ] .
58003014	For we have become fellows with Christ ( the Messiah ) and share in all He has for us , if only we hold our first newborn confidence and original assured expectation [ in virtue of which we are believers ] firm and unshaken to the end .
58003015	Then while it is [ still ] called Today , if you would hear His voice and when you hear it , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion [ in the desert , when the people provoked and irritated and embittered God against them ] .
58003016	For who were they who heard and yet were rebellious and provoked [ Him ] ? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses ?
58003017	And with whom was He irritated and provoked and grieved for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose dismembered bodies were strewn and left in the desert ?
58003018	And to whom did He swear that they should not enter His rest , but to those who disobeyed [ who had not listened to His word and who refused to be compliant or be persuaded ] ?
58003019	So we see that they were not able to enter [ into His rest ] , because of their unwillingness to adhere to and trust in and rely on God [ unbelief had shut them out ] .
58004001	THEREFORE , WHILE the promise of entering His rest still holds and is offered [ today ] , let us be afraid [ to distrust it ] , lest any of you should think he has come too late and has come short of [ reaching ] it .
58004002	For indeed we have had the glad tidings [ Gospel of God ] proclaimed to us just as truly as they [ the Israelites of old did when the good news of deliverance from bondage came to them ] ; but the message they heard did not benefit them , because it was not mixed with faith ( with the leaning of the entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) by those who heard it ; neither were they united in faith with the ones [ Joshua and Caleb ] who heard ( did believe ) .
58004003	For we who have believed ( adhered to and trusted in and relied on God ) do enter that rest , in accordance with His declaration that those [ who did not believe ] should not enter when He said , As I swore in My wrath , They shall not enter My rest ; and this He said although [ His ] works had been completed and prepared [ and waiting for all who would believe ] from the foundation of the world .
58004004	For in a certain place He has said this about the seventh day : And God rested on the seventh day from all His works .
58004005	And [ they forfeited their part in it , for ] in this [ passage ] He said , They shall not enter My rest .
58004006	Seeing then that the promise remains over [ from past times ] for some to enter that rest , and that those who formerly were given the good news about it and the opportunity , failed to appropriate it and did not enter because of disobedience ,
58004007	Again He sets a definite day , [ a new ] Today , [ and gives another opportunity of securing that rest ] saying through David after so long a time in the words already quoted , Today , if you would hear His voice and when you hear it , do not harden your hearts .
58004008	[ This mention of a rest was not a reference to their entering into Canaan . ] For if Joshua had given them rest , He [ God ] would not speak afterward about another day .
58004009	So then , there is still awaiting a full and complete Sabbath-rest reserved for the [ true ] people of God ;
58004010	For he who has once entered [ God’s ] rest also has ceased from [ the weariness and pain ] of human labors , just as God rested from those labors peculiarly His own .
58004011	Let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest [ of God , to know and experience it for ourselves ] , that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience [ into which those in the wilderness fell ] .
58004012	For the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [ making it active , operative , energizing , and effective ] ; it is sharper than any two-edged sword , penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life ( soul ) and [ the immortal ] spirit , and of joints and marrow [ of the deepest parts of our nature ] , exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart .
58004013	And not a creature exists that is concealed from His sight , but all things are open and exposed , naked and defenseless to the eyes of Him with Whom we have to do .
58004014	Inasmuch then as we have a great High Priest Who has [ already ] ascended and passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession [ of faith in Him ] .
58004015	For we do not have a High Priest Who is unable to understand and sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the assaults of temptation , but One Who has been tempted in every respect as we are , yet without sinning .
58004016	Let us then fearlessly and confidently and boldly draw near to the throne of grace ( the throne of God’s unmerited favor to us sinners ) , that we may receive mercy [ for our failures ] and find grace to help in good time for every need [ appropriate help and well-timed help , coming just when we need it ] .
58005001	FOR EVERY high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in things relating to God , to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	He is able to exercise gentleness and forbearance toward the ignorant and erring , since he himself also is liable to moral weakness and physical infirmity .
58005003	And because of this he is obliged to offer sacrifice for his own sins , as well as for those of the people .
58005004	Besides , one does not appropriate for himself the honor [ of being high priest ] , but he is called by God and receives it of Him , just as Aaron did .
58005005	So too Christ ( the Messiah ) did not exalt Himself to be made a high priest , but was appointed and exalted by Him Who said to Him , You are My Son ; today I have begotten You ;
58005006	As He says also in another place , You are a Priest [ appointed ] forever after the order ( with the rank ) of Melchizedek .
58005007	In the days of His flesh [ Jesus ] offered up definite , special petitions [ for that which He not only wanted but needed ] and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him Who was [ always ] able to save Him [ out ] from death , and He was heard because of His reverence toward God [ His godly fear , His piety , in that He shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father ] .
58005008	Although He was a Son , He learned [ active , special ] obedience through what He suffered
58005009	And , [ His completed experience ] making Him perfectly [ equipped ] , He became the Author and Source of eternal salvation to all those who give heed and obey Him ,
58005010	Being designated and recognized and saluted by God as High Priest after the order ( with the rank ) of Melchizedek .
58005011	Concerning this we have much to say which is hard to explain , since you have become dull in your [ spiritual ] hearing and sluggish [ even slothful in achieving spiritual insight ] .
58005012	For even though by this time you ought to be teaching others , you actually need someone to teach you over again the very first principles of God’s Word . You have come to need milk , not solid food .
58005013	For everyone who continues to feed on milk is obviously inexperienced and unskilled in the doctrine of righteousness ( of conformity to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action ) , for he is a mere infant [ not able to talk yet ] !
58005014	But solid food is for full-grown men , for those whose senses and mental faculties are trained by practice to discriminate and distinguish between what is morally good and noble and what is evil and contrary either to divine or human law .
58006001	THEREFORE LET us go on and get past the elementary stage in the teachings and doctrine of Christ ( the Messiah ) , advancing steadily toward the completeness and perfection that belong to spiritual maturity . Let us not again be laying the foundation of repentance and abandonment of dead works ( dead formalism ) and of the faith [ by which you turned ] to God ,
58006002	With teachings about purifying , the laying on of hands , the resurrection from the dead , and eternal judgment and punishment . [ These are all matters of which you should have been fully aware long , long ago . ]
58006003	If indeed God permits , we will [ now ] proceed [ to advanced teaching ] .
58006004	For it is impossible [ to restore and bring again to repentance ] those who have been once for all enlightened , who have consciously tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers of the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	And have felt how good the Word of God is and the mighty powers of the age and world to come ,
58006006	If they then deviate from the faith and turn away from their allegiance -- [ it is impossible ] to bring them back to repentance , for ( because , while , as long as ) they nail upon the cross the Son of God afresh [ as far as they are concerned ] and are holding [ Him ] up to contempt and shame and public disgrace .
58006007	For the soil which has drunk the rain that repeatedly falls upon it and produces vegetation useful to those for whose benefit it is cultivated partakes of a blessing from God .
58006008	But if [ that same soil ] persistently bears thorns and thistles , it is considered worthless and near to being cursed , whose end is to be burned .
58006009	Even though we speak this way , yet in your case , beloved , we are now firmly convinced of better things that are near to salvation and accompany it .
58006010	For God is not unrighteous to forget or overlook your labor and the love which you have shown for His name’s sake in ministering to the needs of the saints ( His own consecrated people ) , as you still do .
58006011	But we do [ strongly and earnestly ] desire for each of you to show the same diligence and sincerity [ all the way through ] in realizing and enjoying the full assurance and development of [ your ] hope until the end ,
58006012	In order that you may not grow disinterested and become [ spiritual ] sluggards , but imitators , behaving as do those who through faith ( by their leaning of the entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) and by practice of patient endurance and waiting are [ now ] inheriting the promises .
58006013	For when God made [ His ] promise to Abraham , He swore by Himself , since He had no one greater by whom to swear ,
58006014	Saying , Blessing I certainly will bless you and multiplying I will multiply you .
58006015	And so it was that he [ Abraham ] , having waited long and endured patiently , realized and obtained [ in the birth of Isaac as a pledge of what was to come ] what God had promised him .
58006016	Men indeed swear by a greater [ than themselves ] , and with them in all disputes the oath taken for confirmation is final [ ending strife ] .
58006017	Accordingly God also , in His desire to show more convincingly and beyond doubt to those who were to inherit the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose and plan , intervened ( mediated ) with an oath .
58006018	This was so that , by two unchangeable things [ His promise and His oath ] in which it is impossible for God ever to prove false or deceive us , we who have fled [ to Him ] for refuge might have mighty indwelling strength and strong encouragement to grasp and hold fast the hope appointed for us and set before [ us ] .
58006019	[ Now ] we have this [ hope ] as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul [ it cannot slip and it cannot break down under whoever steps out upon it -- a hope ] that reaches farther and enters into [ the very certainty of the Presence ] within the veil ,
58006020	Where Jesus has entered in for us [ in advance ] , a Forerunner having become a High Priest forever after the order ( with the rank ) of Melchizedek .
58007001	FOR THIS Melchizedek , king of Salem [ and ] priest of the Most High God , met Abraham as he returned from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
58007002	And Abraham gave to him a tenth portion of all [ the spoil ] . He is primarily , as his name when translated indicates , king of righteousness , and then he is also king of Salem , which means king of peace .
58007003	Without [ record of ] father or mother or ancestral line , neither with beginning of days nor ending of life , but , resembling the Son of God , he continues to be a priest without interruption and without successor .
58007004	Now observe and consider how great [ a personage ] this was to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth [ the topmost or the pick of the heap ] of the spoils .
58007005	And it is true that those descendants of Levi who are charged with the priestly office are commanded in the Law to take tithes from the people -- which means , from their brethren -- though these have descended from Abraham .
58007006	But this person who has not their Levitical ancestry received tithes from Abraham [ himself ] and blessed him who possessed the promises [ of God ] .
58007007	Yet it is beyond all contradiction that it is the lesser person who is blessed by the greater one .
58007008	Furthermore , here [ in the Levitical priesthood ] tithes are received by men who are subject to death ; while there [ in the case of Melchizedek ] , they are received by one of whom it is testified that he lives [ perpetually ] .
58007009	A person might even say that Levi [ the father of the priestly tribe ] himself , who received tithes ( the tenth ) , paid tithes through Abraham ,
58007010	For he was still in the loins of his forefather [ Abraham ] when Melchizedek met him [ Abraham ] .
58007011	Now if perfection ( a perfect fellowship between God and the worshiper ) had been attainable by the Levitical priesthood -- for under it the people were given the Law -- why was it further necessary that there should arise another and different kind of Priest , one after the order of Melchizedek , rather than one appointed after the order and rank of Aaron ?
58007012	For when there is a change in the priesthood , there is of necessity an alteration of the law [ concerning the priesthood ] as well .
58007013	For the One of Whom these things are said belonged [ not to the priestly line but ] to another tribe , no member of which has officiated at the altar .
58007014	For it is obvious that our Lord sprang from the tribe of Judah , and Moses mentioned nothing about priests in connection with that tribe .
58007015	And this becomes more plainly evident when another Priest arises Who bears the likeness of Melchizedek ,
58007016	Who has been constituted a Priest , not on the basis of a bodily legal requirement [ an externally imposed command concerning His physical ancestry ] , but on the basis of the power of an endless and indestructible Life .
58007017	For it is witnessed of Him , You are a Priest forever after the order ( with the rank ) of Melchizedek .
58007018	So a previous physical regulation and command is cancelled because of its weakness and ineffectiveness and uselessness --
58007019	For the Law never made anything perfect -- but instead a better hope is introduced through which we [ now ] come close to God .
58007020	And it was not without the taking of an oath [ that Christ was made Priest ] ,
58007021	For those who formerly became priests received their office without its being confirmed by the taking of an oath by God , but this One was designated and addressed and saluted with an oath , The Lord has sworn and will not regret it or change His mind , You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek .
58007022	In keeping with [ the oath’s greater strength and force ] , Jesus has become the Guarantee of a better ( stronger ) agreement [ a more excellent and more advantageous covenant ] .
58007023	[ Again , the former successive line of priests ] was made up of many , because they were each prevented by death from continuing [ perpetually in office ] ;
58007024	But He holds His priesthood unchangeably , because He lives on forever .
58007025	Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost ( completely , perfectly , finally , and for all time and eternity ) those who come to God through Him , since He is always living to make petition to God and intercede with Him and intervene for them .
58007026	[ Here is ] the High Priest [ perfectly adapted ] to our needs , as was fitting -- holy , blameless , unstained by sin , separated from sinners , and exalted higher than the heavens .
58007027	He has no day by day necessity , as [ do each of these other ] high priests , to offer sacrifice first of all for his own [ personal ] sins and then for those of the people , because He [ met all the requirements ] once for all when He brought Himself [ as a sacrifice ] which He offered up .
58007028	For the Law sets up men in their weakness [ frail , sinful , dying human beings ] as high priests , but the word of [ God’s ] oath , which [ was spoken later ] after the institution of the Law , [ chooses and appoints as priest One Whose appointment is complete and permanent ] , a Son Who has been made perfect forever .
58008001	NOW THE main point of what we have to say is this : We have such a High Priest , One Who is seated at the right hand of the majestic [ God ] in heaven ,
58008002	As officiating Priest , a Minister in the holy places and in the true tabernacle which is erected not by man but by the Lord .
58008003	For every high priest is appointed to offer up gifts and sacrifices ; so it is essential for this [ High Priest ] to have some offering to make also .
58008004	If then He were still living on earth , He would not be a priest at all , for there are [ already priests ] who offer the gifts in accordance with the Law .
58008005	[ But these offer ] service [ merely ] as a pattern and as a foreshadowing of [ what has its true existence and reality in ] the heavenly sanctuary . For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle , he was warned by God , saying , See to it that you make it all [ exactly ] according to the copy ( the model ) which was shown to you on the mountain .
58008006	But as it now is , He [ Christ ] has acquired a [ priestly ] ministry which is as much superior and more excellent [ than the old ] as the covenant ( the agreement ) of which He is the Mediator ( the Arbiter , Agent ) is superior and more excellent , [ because ] it is enacted and rests upon more important ( sublimer , higher , and nobler ) promises .
58008007	For if that first covenant had been without defect , there would have been no room for another one or an attempt to institute another one .
58008008	However , He finds fault with them [ showing its inadequacy ] when He says , Behold , the days will come , says the Lord , when I will make and ratify a new covenant or agreement with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah .
58008009	It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day when I grasped them by the hand to help and relieve them and to lead them out from the land of Egypt , for they did not abide in My agreement with them , and so I withdrew My favor and disregarded them , says the Lord .
58008010	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord : I will imprint My laws upon their minds , even upon their innermost thoughts and understanding , and engrave them upon their hearts ; and I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
58008011	And it will nevermore be necessary for each one to teach his neighbor and his fellow citizen or each one his brother , saying , Know ( perceive , have knowledge of , and get acquainted by experience with ) the Lord , for all will know Me , from the smallest to the greatest of them .
58008012	For I will be merciful and gracious toward their sins and I will remember their deeds of unrighteousness no more .
58008013	When God speaks of a new [ covenant or agreement ] , He makes the first one obsolete ( out of use ) . And what is obsolete ( out of use and annulled because of age ) is ripe for disappearance and to be dispensed with altogether .
58009001	NOW EVEN the first covenant had its own rules and regulations for divine worship , and it had a sanctuary [ but one ] of this world .
58009002	For a tabernacle ( tent ) was erected , in the outer division or compartment of which were the lampstand and the table with [ its loaves of ] the showbread set forth . [ This portion ] is called the Holy Place .
58009003	But [ inside ] beyond the second curtain or veil , [ there stood another ] tabernacle [ division ] known as the Holy of Holies .
58009004	It had the golden altar of incense and the ark ( chest ) of the covenant , covered over with wrought gold . This [ ark ] contained a golden jar which held the manna and the rod of Aaron that sprouted and the [ two stone ] slabs of the covenant [ bearing the Ten Commandments ] .
58009005	Above [ the ark ] and overshadowing the mercy seat were the representations of the cherubim [ winged creatures which were the symbols ] of glory . We cannot now go into detail about these things .
58009006	These arrangements having thus been made , the priests enter [ habitually ] into the outer division of the tabernacle in performance of their ritual acts of worship .
58009007	But into the second [ division of the tabernacle ] none but the high priest goes , and he only once a year , and never without taking a sacrifice of blood with him , which he offers for himself and for the errors and sins of ignorance and thoughtlessness which the people have committed .
58009008	By this the Holy Spirit points out that the way into the [ true Holy of ] Holies is not yet thrown open as long as the former [ the outer portion of the ] tabernacle remains a recognized institution and is still standing ,
58009009	Seeing that that first [ outer portion of the ] tabernacle was a parable ( a visible symbol or type or picture of the present age ) . In it gifts and sacrifices are offered , and yet are incapable of perfecting the conscience or of cleansing and renewing the inner man of the worshiper .
58009010	For [ the ceremonies ] deal only with clean and unclean meats and drinks and different washings , [ mere ] external rules and regulations for the body imposed to tide the worshipers over until the time of setting things straight [ of reformation , of the complete new order when Christ , the Messiah , shall establish the reality of what these things foreshadow -- a better covenant ] .
58009011	But [ that appointed time came ] when Christ ( the Messiah ) appeared as a High Priest of the better things that have come and are to come . [ Then ] through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with [ human ] hands , that is , not a part of this material creation ,
58009012	He went once for all into the [ Holy of ] Holies [ of heaven ] , not by virtue of the blood of goats and calves [ by which to make reconciliation between God and man ] , but His own blood , having found and secured a complete redemption ( an everlasting release for us ) .
58009013	For if [ the mere ] sprinkling of unholy and defiled persons with blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a burnt heifer is sufficient for the purification of the body ,
58009014	How much more surely shall the blood of Christ , Who by virtue of [ His ] eternal Spirit [ His own preexistent divine personality ] has offered Himself as an unblemished sacrifice to God , purify our consciences from dead works and lifeless observances to serve the [ ever ] living God ?
58009015	[ Christ , the Messiah ] is therefore the Negotiator and Mediator of an [ entirely ] new agreement ( testament , covenant ) , so that those who are called and offered it may receive the fulfillment of the promised everlasting inheritance -- since a death has taken place which rescues and delivers and redeems them from the transgressions committed under the [ old ] first agreement .
58009016	For where there is a [ last ] will and testament involved , the death of the one who made it must be established ,
58009017	For a will and testament is valid and takes effect only at death , since it has no force or legal power as long as the one who made it is alive .
58009018	So even the [ old ] first covenant ( God’s will ) was not inaugurated and ratified and put in force without the shedding of blood .
58009019	For when every command of the Law had been read out by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of slain calves and goats , together with water and scarlet wool and with a bunch of hyssop , and sprinkled both the Book ( the roll of the Law and covenant ) itself and all the people ,
58009020	Saying these words : This is the blood that seals and ratifies the agreement ( the testament , the covenant ) which God commanded [ me to deliver to ] you .
58009021	And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the [ sacred ] vessels and appliances used in [ divine ] worship .
58009022	[ In fact ] under the Law almost everything is purified by means of blood , and without the shedding of blood there is neither release from sin and its guilt nor the remission of the due and merited punishment for sins .
58009023	By such means , therefore , it was necessary for the [ earthly ] copies of the heavenly things to be purified , but the actual heavenly things themselves [ required far ] better and nobler sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Christ ( the Messiah ) has not entered into a sanctuary made with [ human ] hands , only a copy and pattern and type of the true one , but [ He has entered ] into heaven itself , now to appear in the [ very ] presence of God on our behalf .
58009025	Nor did He [ enter into the heavenly sanctuary to ] offer Himself regularly again and again , as the high priest enters the [ Holy of ] Holies every year with blood not his own .
58009026	For then would He often have had to suffer [ over and over again ] since the foundation of the world . But as it now is , He has once for all at the consummation and close of the ages appeared to put away and abolish sin by His sacrifice [ of Himself ] .
58009027	And just as it is appointed for [ all ] men once to die , and after that the [ certain ] judgment ,
58009028	Even so it is that Christ , having been offered to take upon Himself and bear as a burden the sins of many once and once for all , will appear a second time , not to carry any burden of sin nor to deal with sin , but to bring to full salvation those who are [ eagerly , constantly , and patiently ] waiting for and expecting Him .
58010001	FOR SINCE the Law has merely a rude outline ( foreshadowing ) of the good things to come -- instead of fully expressing those things -- it can never by offering the same sacrifices continually year after year make perfect those who approach [ its altars ] .
58010002	For if it were otherwise , would [ these sacrifices ] not have stopped being offered ? Since the worshipers had once for all been cleansed , they would no longer have any guilt or consciousness of sin .
58010003	But [ as it is ] these sacrifices annually bring a fresh remembrance of sins [ to be atoned for ] ,
58010004	Because the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take sins away .
58010005	Hence , when He [ Christ ] entered into the world , He said , Sacrifices and offerings You have not desired , but instead You have made ready a body for Me [ to offer ] ;
58010006	In burnt offerings and sin offerings You have taken no delight .
58010007	Then I said , Behold , here I am , coming to do Your will , O God -- [ to fulfill ] what is written of Me in the volume of the Book .
58010008	When He said just before , You have neither desired , nor have You taken delight in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings -- all of which are offered according to the Law --
58010009	He then went on to say , Behold , [ here ] I am , coming to do Your will . Thus He does away with and annuls the first ( former ) order [ as a means of expiating sin ] so that He might inaugurate and establish the second ( latter ) order .
58010010	And in accordance with this will [ of God ] , we have been made holy ( consecrated and sanctified ) through the offering made once for all of the body of Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
58010011	Furthermore , every [ human ] priest stands [ at his altar of service ] ministering daily , offering the same sacrifices over and over again , which never are able to strip [ from every side of us ] the sins [ that envelop us ] and take them away --
58010012	Whereas this One [ Christ ] , after He had offered a single sacrifice for our sins [ that shall avail ] for all time , sat down at the right hand of God ,
58010013	Then to wait until His enemies should be made a stool beneath His feet .
58010014	For by a single offering He has forever completely cleansed and perfected those who are consecrated and made holy .
58010015	And also the Holy Spirit adds His testimony to us [ in confirmation of this ] . For having said ,
58010016	This is the agreement ( testament , covenant ) that I will set up and conclude with them after those days , says the Lord : I will imprint My laws upon their hearts , and I will inscribe them on their minds ( on their inmost thoughts and understanding ) ,
58010017	He then goes on to say , And their sins and their lawbreaking I will remember no more .
58010018	Now where there is absolute remission ( forgiveness and cancellation of the penalty ) of these [ sins and lawbreaking ] , there is no longer any offering made to atone for sin .
58010019	Therefore , brethren , since we have full freedom and confidence to enter into the [ Holy of ] Holies [ by the power and virtue ] in the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	By this fresh ( new ) and living way which He initiated and dedicated and opened for us through the separating curtain ( veil of the Holy of Holies ) , that is , through His flesh ,
58010021	And since we have [ such ] a great and wonderful and noble Priest [ Who rules ] over the house of God ,
58010022	Let us all come forward and draw near with true ( honest and sincere ) hearts in unqualified assurance and absolute conviction engendered by faith ( by that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) , having our hearts sprinkled and purified from a guilty ( evil ) conscience and our bodies cleansed with pure water .
58010023	So let us seize and hold fast and retain without wavering the hope we cherish and confess and our acknowledgement of it , for He Who promised is reliable ( sure ) and faithful to His word .
58010024	And let us consider and give attentive , continuous care to watching over one another , studying how we may stir up ( stimulate and incite ) to love and helpful deeds and noble activities ,
58010025	Not forsaking or neglecting to assemble together [ as believers ] , as is the habit of some people , but admonishing ( warning , urging , and encouraging ) one another , and all the more faithfully as you see the day approaching .
58010026	For if we go on deliberately and willingly sinning after once acquiring the knowledge of the Truth , there is no longer any sacrifice left to atone for [ our ] sins [ no further offering to which to look forward ] .
58010027	[ There is nothing left for us then ] but a kind of awful and fearful prospect and expectation of divine judgment and the fury of burning wrath and indignation which will consume those who put themselves in opposition [ to God ] .
58010028	Any person who has violated and [ thus ] rejected and set at naught the Law of Moses is put to death without pity or mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much worse ( sterner and heavier ) punishment do you suppose he will be judged to deserve who has spurned and [ thus ] trampled underfoot the Son of God , and who has considered the covenant blood by which he was consecrated common and unhallowed , thus profaning it and insulting and outraging the [ Holy ] Spirit [ Who imparts ] grace ( the unmerited favor and blessing of God ) ?
58010030	For we know Him Who said , Vengeance is Mine [ retribution and the meting out of full justice rest with Me ] ; I will repay [ I will exact the compensation ] , says the Lord . And again , The Lord will judge and determine and solve and settle the cause and the cases of His people .
58010031	It is a fearful ( formidable and terrible ) thing to incur the divine penalties and be cast into the hands of the living God !
58010032	But be ever mindful of the days gone by in which , after you were first spiritually enlightened , you endured a great and painful struggle ,
58010033	Sometimes being yourselves a gazingstock , publicly exposed to insults and abuse and distress , and sometimes claiming fellowship and making common cause with others who were so treated .
58010034	For you did sympathize and suffer along with those who were imprisoned , and you bore cheerfully the plundering of your belongings and the confiscation of your property , in the knowledge and consciousness that you yourselves had a better and lasting possession .
58010035	Do not , therefore , fling away your fearless confidence , for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward .
58010036	For you have need of steadfast patience and endurance , so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God , and thus receive and carry away [ and enjoy to the full ] what is promised .
58010037	For still a little while ( a very little while ) , and the Coming One will come and He will not delay .
58010038	But the just shall live by faith [ My righteous servant shall live by his conviction respecting man’s relationship to God and divine things , and holy fervor born of faith and conjoined with it ] ; and if he draws back and shrinks in fear , My soul has no delight or pleasure in him .
58010039	But our way is not that of those who draw back to eternal misery ( perdition ) and are utterly destroyed , but we are of those who believe [ who cleave to and trust in and rely on God through Jesus Christ , the Messiah ] and by faith preserve the soul .
58011001	NOW FAITH is the assurance ( the confirmation , the title deed ) of the things [ we ] hope for , being the proof of things [ we ] do not see and the conviction of their reality [ faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses ] .
58011002	For by [ faith -- trust and holy fervor born of faith ] the men of old had divine testimony borne to them and obtained a good report .
58011003	By faith we understand that the worlds [ during the successive ages ] were framed ( fashioned , put in order , and equipped for their intended purpose ) by the word of God , so that what we see was not made out of things which are visible .
58011004	[ Prompted , actuated ] by faith Abel brought God a better and more acceptable sacrifice than Cain , because of which it was testified of him that he was righteous [ that he was upright and in right standing with God ] , and God bore witness by accepting and acknowledging his gifts . And though he died , yet [ through the incident ] he is still speaking .
58011005	Because of faith Enoch was caught up and transferred to heaven , so that he did not have a glimpse of death ; and he was not found , because God had translated him . For even before he was taken to heaven , he received testimony [ still on record ] that he had pleased and been satisfactory to God .
58011006	But without faith it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him . For whoever would come near to God must [ necessarily ] believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him [ out ] .
58011007	[ Prompted ] by faith Noah , being forewarned by God concerning events of which as yet there was no visible sign , took heed and diligently and reverently constructed and prepared an ark for the deliverance of his own family . By this [ his faith which relied on God ] he passed judgment and sentence on the world’s unbelief and became an heir and possessor of righteousness ( that relation of being right into which God puts the person who has faith ) .
58011008	[ Urged on ] by faith Abraham , when he was called , obeyed and went forth to a place which he was destined to receive as an inheritance ; and he went , although he did not know or trouble his mind about where he was to go .
58011009	[ Prompted ] by faith he dwelt as a temporary resident in the land which was designated in the promise [ of God , though he was like a stranger ] in a strange country , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , fellow heirs with him of the same promise .
58011010	For he was [ waiting expectantly and confidently ] looking forward to the city which has fixed and firm foundations , whose Architect and Builder is God .
58011011	Because of faith also Sarah herself received physical power to conceive a child , even when she was long past the age for it , because she considered [ God ] Who had given her the promise to be reliable and trustworthy and true to His word .
58011012	So from one man , though he was physically as good as dead , there have sprung descendants whose number is as the stars of heaven and as countless as the innumerable sands on the seashore .
58011013	These people all died controlled and sustained by their faith , but not having received the tangible fulfillment of [ God’s ] promises , only having seen it and greeted it from a great distance by faith , and all the while acknowledging and confessing that they were strangers and temporary residents and exiles upon the earth .
58011014	Now those people who talk as they did show plainly that they are in search of a fatherland ( their own country ) .
58011015	If they had been thinking with [ homesick ] remembrance of that country from which they were emigrants , they would have found constant opportunity to return to it .
58011016	But the truth is that they were yearning for and aspiring to a better and more desirable country , that is , a heavenly [ one ] . For that reason God is not ashamed to be called their God [ even to be surnamed their God -- the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ] , for He has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith Abraham , when he was put to the test [ while the testing of his faith was still in progress ] , had already brought Isaac for an offering ; he who had gladly received and welcomed [ God’s ] promises was ready to sacrifice his only son ,
58011018	Of whom it was said , Through Isaac shall your descendants be reckoned .
58011019	For he reasoned that God was able to raise [ him ] up even from among the dead . Indeed in the sense that Isaac was figuratively dead [ potentially sacrificed ] , he did [ actually ] receive him back from the dead .
58011020	[ With eyes of ] faith Isaac , looking far into the future , invoked blessings upon Jacob and Esau .
58011021	[ Prompted ] by faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of Joseph’s sons and bowed in prayer over the top of his staff .
58011022	[ Actuated ] by faith Joseph , when nearing the end of his life , referred to [ the promise of God for ] the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his own bones .
58011023	[ Prompted ] by faith Moses , after his birth , was kept concealed for three months by his parents , because they saw how comely the child was ; and they were not overawed and terrified by the king’s decree .
58011024	[ Aroused ] by faith Moses , when he had grown to maturity and become great , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter ,
58011025	Because he preferred to share the oppression [ suffer the hardships ] and bear the shame of the people of God rather than to have the fleeting enjoyment of a sinful life .
58011026	He considered the contempt and abuse and shame [ borne for ] the Christ ( the Messiah Who was to come ) to be greater wealth than all the treasures of Egypt , for he looked forward and away to the reward ( recompense ) .
58011027	[ Motivated ] by faith he left Egypt behind him , being unawed and undismayed by the wrath of the king ; for he never flinched but held staunchly to his purpose and endured steadfastly as one who gazed on Him Who is invisible .
58011028	By faith ( simple trust and confidence in God ) he instituted and carried out the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood [ on the doorposts ] , so that the destroyer of the firstborn ( the angel ) might not touch those [ of the children of Israel ] .
58011029	[ Urged on ] by faith the people crossed the Red Sea as [ though ] on dry land , but when the Egyptians tried to do the same thing they were swallowed up [ by the sea ] .
58011030	Because of faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encompassed for seven days [ by the Israelites ] .
58011031	[ Prompted ] by faith Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed along with those who refused to believe and obey , because she had received the spies in peace [ without enmity ] .
58011032	And what shall I say further ? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets ,
58011033	Who by [ the help of ] faith subdued kingdoms , administered justice , obtained promised blessings , closed the mouths of lions ,
58011034	Extinguished the power of raging fire , escaped the devourings of the sword , out of frailty and weakness won strength and became stalwart , even mighty and resistless in battle , routing alien hosts .
58011035	[ Some ] women received again their dead by a resurrection . Others were tortured to death with clubs , refusing to accept release [ offered on the terms of denying their faith ] , so that they might be resurrected to a better life .
58011036	Others had to suffer the trial of mocking and scourging and even chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were stoned to death ; they were lured with tempting offers [ to renounce their faith ] ; they were sawn asunder ; they were slaughtered by the sword ; [ while they were alive ] they had to go about wrapped in the skins of sheep and goats , utterly destitute , oppressed , cruelly treated --
58011038	[ Men ] of whom the world was not worthy -- roaming over the desolate places and the mountains , and [ living ] in caves and caverns and holes of the earth .
58011039	And all of these , though they won divine approval by [ means of ] their faith , did not receive the fulfillment of what was promised ,
58011040	Because God had us in mind and had something better and greater in view for us , so that they [ these heroes and heroines of faith ] should not come to perfection apart from us [ before we could join them ] .
58012001	THEREFORE THEN , since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses [ who have borne testimony to the Truth ] , let us strip off and throw aside every encumbrance ( unnecessary weight ) and that sin which so readily ( deftly and cleverly ) clings to and entangles us , and let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us ,
58012002	Looking away [ from all that will distract ] to Jesus , Who is the Leader and the Source of our faith [ giving the first incentive for our belief ] and is also its Finisher [ bringing it to maturity and perfection ] . He , for the joy [ of obtaining the prize ] that was set before Him , endured the cross , despising and ignoring the shame , and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Just think of Him Who endured from sinners such grievous opposition and bitter hostility against Himself [ reckon up and consider it all in comparison with your trials ] , so that you may not grow weary or exhausted , losing heart and relaxing and fainting in your minds .
58012004	You have not yet struggled and fought agonizingly against sin , nor have you yet resisted and withstood to the point of pouring out your [ own ] blood .
58012005	And have you [ completely ] forgotten the divine word of appeal and encouragement in which you are reasoned with and addressed as sons ? My son , do not think lightly or scorn to submit to the correction and discipline of the Lord , nor lose courage and give up and faint when you are reproved or corrected by Him ;
58012006	For the Lord corrects and disciplines everyone whom He loves , and He punishes , even scourges , every son whom He accepts and welcomes to His heart and cherishes .
58012007	You must submit to and endure [ correction ] for discipline ; God is dealing with you as with sons . For what son is there whom his father does not [ thus ] train and correct and discipline ?
58012008	Now if you are exempt from correction and left without discipline in which all [ of God’s children ] share , then you are illegitimate offspring and not true sons [ at all ] .
58012009	Moreover , we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we yielded [ to them ] and respected [ them for training us ] . Shall we not much more cheerfully submit to the Father of spirits and so [ truly ] live ?
58012010	For [ our earthly fathers ] disciplined us for only a short period of time and chastised us as seemed proper and good to them ; but He disciplines us for our certain good , that we may become sharers in His own holiness .
58012011	For the time being no discipline brings joy , but seems grievous and painful ; but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it [ a harvest of fruit which consists in righteousness -- in conformity to God’s will in purpose , thought , and action , resulting in right living and right standing with God ] .
58012012	So then , brace up and reinvigorate and set right your slackened and weakened and drooping hands and strengthen your feeble and palsied and tottering knees ,
58012013	And cut through and make firm and plain and smooth , straight paths for your feet [ yes , make them safe and upright and happy paths that go in the right direction ] , so that the lame and halting [ limbs ] may not be put out of joint , but rather may be cured .
58012014	Strive to live in peace with everybody and pursue that consecration and holiness without which no one will [ ever ] see the Lord .
58012015	Exercise foresight and be on the watch to look [ after one another ] , to see that no one falls back from and fails to secure God’s grace ( His unmerited favor and spiritual blessing ) , in order that no root of resentment ( rancor , bitterness , or hatred ) shoots forth and causes trouble and bitter torment , and the many become contaminated and defiled by it --
58012016	That no one may become guilty of sexual vice , or become a profane ( godless and sacrilegious ) person as Esau did , who sold his own birthright for a single meal .
58012017	For you understand that later on , when he wanted [ to regain title to ] his inheritance of the blessing , he was rejected ( disqualified and set aside ) , for he could find no opportunity to repair by repentance [ what he had done , no chance to recall the choice he had made ] , although he sought for it carefully with [ bitter ] tears .
58012018	For you have not come [ as did the Israelites in the wilderness ] to a [ material ] mountain that can be touched , [ a mountain ] that is ablaze with fire , and to gloom and darkness and a raging storm ,
58012019	And to the blast of a trumpet and a voice whose words make the listeners beg that nothing more be said to them .
58012020	For they could not bear the command that was given : If even a wild animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned to death .
58012021	In fact , so awful and terrifying was the [ phenomenal ] sight that Moses said , I am terrified ( aghast and trembling with fear ) .
58012022	But rather , you have come to Mount Zion , even to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to countless multitudes of angels in festal gathering ,
58012023	And to the church ( assembly ) of the Firstborn who are registered [ as citizens ] in heaven , and to the God Who is Judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous ( the redeemed in heaven ) who have been made perfect ,
58012024	And to Jesus , the Mediator ( Go-between , Agent ) of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood which speaks [ of mercy ] , a better and nobler and more gracious message than the blood of Abel [ which cried out for vengeance ] .
58012025	So see to it that you do not reject Him or refuse to listen to and heed Him Who is speaking [ to you now ] . For if they [ the Israelites ] did not escape when they refused to listen and heed Him Who warned and divinely instructed them [ here ] on earth [ revealing with heavenly warnings His will ] , how much less shall we escape if we reject and turn our backs on Him Who cautions and admonishes [ us ] from heaven ?
58012026	Then [ at Mount Sinai ] His voice shook the earth , but now He has given a promise : Yet once more I will shake and make tremble not only the earth but also the [ starry ] heavens .
58012027	Now this expression , Yet once more , indicates the final removal and transformation of all [ that can be ] shaken -- that is , of that which has been created -- in order that what cannot be shaken may remain and continue .
58012028	Let us therefore , receiving a kingdom that is firm and stable and cannot be shaken , offer to God pleasing service and acceptable worship , with modesty and pious care and godly fear and awe ;
58012029	For our God [ is indeed ] a consuming fire .
58013001	LET LOVE for your fellow believers continue and be a fixed practice with you [ never let it fail ] .
58013002	Do not forget or neglect or refuse to extend hospitality to strangers [ in the brotherhood -- being friendly , cordial , and gracious , sharing the comforts of your home and doing your part generously ] , for through it some have entertained angels without knowing it .
58013003	Remember those who are in prison as if you were their fellow prisoner , and those who are ill-treated , since you also are liable to bodily sufferings .
58013004	Let marriage be held in honor ( esteemed worthy , precious , of great price , and especially dear ) in all things . And thus let the marriage bed be undefiled ( kept undishonored ) ; for God will judge and punish the unchaste [ all guilty of sexual vice ] and adulterous .
58013005	Let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money [ including greed , avarice , lust , and craving for earthly possessions ] and be satisfied with your present [ circumstances and with what you have ] ; for He [ God ] Himself has said , I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support . [ I will ] not , [ I will ] not , [ I will ] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [ you ] down ( relax My hold on you ) ! [ Assuredly not ! ]
58013006	So we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and boldly say , The Lord is my Helper ; I will not be seized with alarm [ I will not fear or dread or be terrified ] . What can man do to me ?
58013007	Remember your leaders and superiors in authority [ for it was they ] who brought to you the Word of God . Observe attentively and consider their manner of living ( the outcome of their well-spent lives ) and imitate their faith ( their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and Ruler of all things , the Provider and Bestower of eternal salvation through Christ , and their leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) .
58013008	Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) is [ always ] the same , yesterday , today , [ yes ] and forever ( to the ages ) .
58013009	Do not be carried about by different and varied and alien teachings ; for it is good for the heart to be established and ennobled and strengthened by means of grace ( God’s favor and spiritual blessing ) and not [ to be devoted to ] foods [ rules of diet and ritualistic meals ] , which bring no [ spiritual ] benefit or profit to those who observe them .
58013010	We have an altar from which those who serve and worship in the tabernacle have no right to eat .
58013011	For when the blood of animals is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin , the victims’ bodies are burned outside the limits of the camp .
58013012	Therefore Jesus also suffered and died outside the [ city’s ] gate in order that He might purify and consecrate the people through [ the shedding of ] His own blood and set them apart as holy [ for God ] .
58013013	Let us then go forth [ from all that would prevent us ] to Him outside the camp [ at Calvary ] , bearing the contempt and abuse and shame with Him .
58013014	For here we have no permanent city , but we are looking for the one which is to come .
58013015	Through Him , therefore , let us constantly and at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise , which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge and confess and glorify His name .
58013016	Do not forget or neglect to do kindness and good , to be generous and distribute and contribute to the needy [ of the church as embodiment and proof of fellowship ] , for such sacrifices are pleasing to God .
58013017	Obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them [ continually recognizing their authority over you ] , for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual welfare , as men who will have to render an account [ of their trust ] . [ Do your part to ] let them do this with gladness and not with sighing and groaning , for that would not be profitable to you [ either ] .
58013018	Keep praying for us , for we are convinced that we have a good ( clear ) conscience , that we want to walk uprightly and live a noble life , acting honorably and in complete honesty in all things .
58013019	And I beg of you [ to pray for us ] the more earnestly , in order that I may be restored to you the sooner .
58013020	Now may the God of peace [ Who is the Author and the Giver of peace ] , Who brought again from among the dead our Lord Jesus , that great Shepherd of the sheep , by the blood [ that sealed , ratified ] the everlasting agreement ( covenant , testament ) ,
58013021	Strengthen ( complete , perfect ) and make you what you ought to be and equip you with everything good that you may carry out His will ; [ while He Himself ] works in you and accomplishes that which is pleasing in His sight , through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) ; to Whom be the glory forever and ever ( to the ages of the ages ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
58013022	I call on you , brethren , to listen patiently and bear with this message of exhortation and admonition and encouragement , for I have written to you briefly .
58013023	Notice that our brother Timothy has been released [ from prison ] . If he comes here soon , I will see you along with him .
58013024	Give our greetings to all of your spiritual leaders and to all of the saints ( God’s consecrated believers ) . The Italian Christians send you their greetings [ also ] .
58013025	Grace ( God’s favor and spiritual blessing ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) .
59001001	JAMES , A servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes scattered abroad [ among the Gentiles in the dispersion ] : Greetings ( rejoice ) !
59001002	Consider it wholly joyful , my brethren , whenever you are enveloped in or encounter trials of any sort or fall into various temptations .
59001003	Be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience .
59001004	But let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work , so that you may be [ people ] perfectly and fully developed [ with no defects ] , lacking in nothing .
59001005	If any of you is deficient in wisdom , let him ask of the giving God [ Who gives ] to everyone liberally and ungrudgingly , without reproaching or faultfinding , and it will be given him .
59001006	Only it must be in faith that he asks with no wavering ( no hesitating , no doubting ) . For the one who wavers ( hesitates , doubts ) is like the billowing surge out at sea that is blown hither and thither and tossed by the wind .
59001007	For truly , let not such a person imagine that he will receive anything [ he asks for ] from the Lord ,
59001008	[ For being as he is ] a man of two minds ( hesitating , dubious , irresolute ) , [ he is ] unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything [ he thinks , feels , decides ] .
59001009	Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his elevation [ as a Christian , called to the true riches and to be an heir of God ] ,
59001010	And the rich [ person ought to glory ] in being humbled [ by being shown his human frailty ] , because like the flower of the grass he will pass away .
59001011	For the sun comes up with a scorching heat and parches the grass ; its flower falls off and its beauty fades away . Even so will the rich man wither and die in the midst of his pursuits .
59001012	Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) is the man who is patient under trial and stands up under temptation , for when he has stood the test and been approved , he will receive [ the victor’s ] crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him .
59001013	Let no one say when he is tempted , I am tempted from God ; for God is incapable of being tempted by [ what is ] evil and He Himself tempts no one .
59001014	But every person is tempted when he is drawn away , enticed and baited by his own evil desire ( lust , passions ) .
59001015	Then the evil desire , when it has conceived , gives birth to sin , and sin , when it is fully matured , brings forth death .
59001016	Do not be misled , my beloved brethren .
59001017	Every good gift and every perfect ( free , large , full ) gift is from above ; it comes down from the Father of all [ that gives ] light , in [ the shining of ] Whom there can be no variation [ rising or setting ] or shadow cast by His turning [ as in an eclipse ] .
59001018	And it was of His own [ free ] will that He gave us birth [ as sons ] by [ His ] Word of Truth , so that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures [ a sample of what He created to be consecrated to Himself ] .
59001019	Understand [ this ] , my beloved brethren . Let every man be quick to hear [ a ready listener ] , slow to speak , slow to take offense and to get angry .
59001020	For man’s anger does not promote the righteousness God [ wishes and requires ] .
59001021	So get rid of all uncleanness and the rampant outgrowth of wickedness , and in a humble ( gentle , modest ) spirit receive and welcome the Word which implanted and rooted [ in your hearts ] contains the power to save your souls .
59001022	But be doers of the Word [ obey the message ] , and not merely listeners to it , betraying yourselves [ into deception by reasoning contrary to the Truth ] .
59001023	For if anyone only listens to the Word without obeying it and being a doer of it , he is like a man who looks carefully at his [ own ] natural face in a mirror ;
59001024	For he thoughtfully observes himself , and then goes off and promptly forgets what he was like .
59001025	But he who looks carefully into the faultless law , the [ law ] of liberty , and is faithful to it and perseveres in looking into it , being not a heedless listener who forgets but an active doer [ who obeys ] , he shall be blessed in his doing ( his life of obedience ) .
59001026	If anyone thinks himself to be religious ( piously observant of the external duties of his faith ) and does not bridle his tongue but deludes his own heart , this person’s religious service is worthless ( futile , barren ) .
59001027	External religious worship [ religion as it is expressed in outward acts ] that is pure and unblemished in the sight of God the Father is this : to visit and help and care for the orphans and widows in their affliction and need , and to keep oneself unspotted and uncontaminated from the world .
59002001	MY BRETHREN , pay no servile regard to people [ show no prejudice , no partiality ] . Do not [ attempt to ] hold and practice the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ [ the Lord ] of glory [ together with snobbery ] !
59002002	For if a person comes into your congregation whose hands are adorned with gold rings and who is wearing splendid apparel , and also a poor [ man ] in shabby clothes comes in ,
59002003	And you pay special attention to the one who wears the splendid clothes and say to him , Sit here in this preferable seat ! while you tell the poor [ man ] , Stand there ! or , Sit there on the floor at my feet !
59002004	Are you not discriminating among your own and becoming critics and judges with wrong motives ?
59002005	Listen , my beloved brethren : Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and in their position as believers and to inherit the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him ?
59002006	But you [ in contrast ] have insulted ( humiliated , dishonored , and shown your contempt for ) the poor . Is it not the rich who domineer over you ? Is it not they who drag you into the law courts ?
59002007	Is it not they who slander and blaspheme that precious name by which you are distinguished and called [ the name of Christ invoked in baptism ] ?
59002008	If indeed you [ really ] fulfill the royal Law in accordance with the Scripture , You shall love your neighbor as [ you love ] yourself , you do well .
59002009	But if you show servile regard ( prejudice , favoritism ) for people , you commit sin and are rebuked and convicted by the Law as violators and offenders .
59002010	For whosoever keeps the Law [ as a ] whole but stumbles and offends in one [ single instance ] has become guilty of [ breaking ] all of it .
59002011	For He Who said , You shall not commit adultery , also said , You shall not kill . If you do not commit adultery but do kill , you have become guilty of transgressing the [ whole ] Law .
59002012	So speak and so act as [ people should ] who are to be judged under the law of liberty [ the moral instruction given by Christ , especially about love ] .
59002013	For to him who has shown no mercy the judgment [ will be ] merciless , but mercy [ full of glad confidence ] exults victoriously over judgment .
59002014	What is the use ( profit ) , my brethren , for anyone to profess to have faith if he has no [ good ] works [ to show for it ] ? Can [ such ] faith save [ his soul ] ?
59002015	If a brother or sister is poorly clad and lacks food for each day ,
59002016	And one of you says to him , Good-bye ! Keep [ yourself ] warm and well fed , without giving him the necessities for the body , what good does that do ?
59002017	So also faith , if it does not have works ( deeds and actions of obedience to back it up ) , by itself is destitute of power ( inoperative , dead ) .
59002018	But someone will say [ to you then ] , You [ say you ] have faith , and I have [ good ] works . Now you show me your [ alleged ] faith apart from any [ good ] works [ if you can ] , and I by [ good ] works [ of obedience ] will show you my faith .
59002019	You believe that God is one ; you do well . So do the demons believe and shudder [ in terror and horror such as make a man’s hair stand on end and contract the surface of his skin ] !
59002020	Are you willing to be shown [ proof ] , you foolish ( unproductive , spiritually deficient ) fellow , that faith apart from [ good ] works is inactive and ineffective and worthless ?
59002021	Was not our forefather Abraham [ shown to be ] justified ( made acceptable to God ) by [ his ] works when he brought to the altar as an offering his [ own ] son Isaac ?
59002022	You see that [ his ] faith was cooperating with his works , and [ his ] faith was completed and reached its supreme expression [ when he implemented it ] by [ good ] works .
59002023	And [ so ] the Scripture was fulfilled that says , Abraham believed in ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on ) God , and this was accounted to him as righteousness ( as conformity to God’s will in thought and deed ) , and he was called God’s friend .
59002024	You see that a man is justified ( pronounced righteous before God ) through what he does and not alone through faith [ through works of obedience as well as by what he believes ] .
59002025	So also with Rahab the harlot -- was she not shown to be justified ( pronounced righteous before God ) by [ good ] deeds when she took in the scouts ( spies ) and sent them away by a different route ?
59002026	For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless , so faith apart from [ its ] works of obedience is also dead .
59003001	NOT MANY [ of you ] should become teachers ( self-constituted censors and reprovers of others ) , my brethren , for you know that we [ teachers ] will be judged by a higher standard and with greater severity [ than other people ; thus we assume the greater accountability and the more condemnation ] .
59003002	For we all often stumble and fall and offend in many things . And if anyone does not offend in speech [ never says the wrong things ] , he is a fully developed character and a perfect man , able to control his whole body and to curb his entire nature .
59003003	If we set bits in the horses’ mouths to make them obey us , we can turn their whole bodies about .
59003004	Likewise , look at the ships : though they are so great and are driven by rough winds , they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines .
59003005	Even so the tongue is a little member , and it can boast of great things . See how much wood or how great a forest a tiny spark can set ablaze !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire . [ The tongue is a ] world of wickedness set among our members , contaminating and depraving the whole body and setting on fire the wheel of birth ( the cycle of man’s nature ) , being itself ignited by hell ( Gehenna ) .
59003007	For every kind of beast and bird , of reptile and sea animal , can be tamed and has been tamed by human genius ( nature ) .
59003008	But the human tongue can be tamed by no man . It is a restless ( undisciplined , irreconcilable ) evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With it we bless the Lord and Father , and with it we curse men who were made in God’s likeness !
59003010	Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing . These things , my brethren , ought not to be so .
59003011	Does a fountain send forth [ simultaneously ] from the same opening fresh water and bitter ?
59003012	Can a fig tree , my brethren , bear olives , or a grapevine figs ? Neither can a salt spring furnish fresh water .
59003013	Who is there among you who is wise and intelligent ? Then let him by his noble living show forth his [ good ] works with the [ unobtrusive ] humility [ which is the proper attribute ] of true wisdom .
59003014	But if you have bitter jealousy ( envy ) and contention ( rivalry , selfish ambition ) in your hearts , do not pride yourselves on it and thus be in defiance of and false to the Truth .
59003015	This [ superficial ] wisdom is not such as comes down from above , but is earthly , unspiritual ( animal ) , even devilish ( demoniacal ) .
59003016	For wherever there is jealousy ( envy ) and contention ( rivalry and selfish ambition ) , there will also be confusion ( unrest , disharmony , rebellion ) and all sorts of evil and vile practices .
59003017	But the wisdom from above is first of all pure ( undefiled ) ; then it is peace-loving , courteous ( considerate , gentle ) . [ It is willing to ] yield to reason , full of compassion and good fruits ; it is wholehearted and straightforward , impartial and unfeigned ( free from doubts , wavering , and insincerity ) .
59003018	And the harvest of righteousness ( of conformity to God’s will in thought and deed ) is [ the fruit of the seed ] sown in peace by those who work for and make peace [ in themselves and in others , that peace which means concord , agreement , and harmony between individuals , with undisturbedness , in a peaceful mind free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts ] .
59004001	WHAT LEADS to strife ( discord and feuds ) and how do conflicts ( quarrels and fightings ) originate among you ? Do they not arise from your sensual desires that are ever warring in your bodily members ?
59004002	You are jealous and covet [ what others have ] and your desires go unfulfilled ; [ so ] you become murderers . [ To hate is to murder as far as your hearts are concerned . ] You burn with envy and anger and are not able to obtain [ the gratification , the contentment , and the happiness that you seek ] , so you fight and war . You do not have , because you do not ask .
59004003	[ Or ] you do ask [ God for them ] and yet fail to receive , because you ask with wrong purpose and evil , selfish motives . Your intention is [ when you get what you desire ] to spend it in sensual pleasures .
59004004	You [ are like ] unfaithful wives [ having illicit love affairs with the world and breaking your marriage vow to God ] ! Do you not know that being the world’s friend is being God’s enemy ? So whoever chooses to be a friend of the world takes his stand as an enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you suppose that the Scripture is speaking to no purpose that says , The Spirit Whom He has caused to dwell in us yearns over us and He yearns for the Spirit [ to be welcome ] with a jealous love ?
59004006	But He gives us more and more grace ( power of the Holy Spirit , to meet this evil tendency and all others fully ) . That is why He says , God sets Himself against the proud and haughty , but gives grace [ continually ] to the lowly ( those who are humble enough to receive it ) .
59004007	So be subject to God . Resist the devil [ stand firm against him ] , and he will flee from you .
59004008	Come close to God and He will come close to you . [ Recognize that you are ] sinners , get your soiled hands clean ; [ realize that you have been disloyal ] wavering individuals with divided interests , and purify your hearts [ of your spiritual adultery ] .
59004009	[ As you draw near to God ] be deeply penitent and grieve , even weep [ over your disloyalty ] . Let your laughter be turned to grief and your mirth to dejection and heartfelt shame [ for your sins ] .
59004010	Humble yourselves [ feeling very insignificant ] in the presence of the Lord , and He will exalt you [ He will lift you up and make your lives significant ] .
59004011	[ My ] brethren , do not speak evil about or accuse one another . He that maligns a brother or judges his brother is maligning and criticizing the Law and judging the Law . But if you judge the Law , you are not a practicer of the Law but a censor and judge [ of it ] .
59004012	One only is the Lawgiver and Judge Who is able to save and to destroy [ the One Who has the absolute power of life and death ] . [ But you ] who are you that [ you presume to ] pass judgment on your neighbor ?
59004013	Come now , you who say , Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a city and spend a year there and carry on our business and make money .
59004014	Yet you do not know [ the least thing ] about what may happen tomorrow . What is the nature of your life ? You are [ really ] but a wisp of vapor ( a puff of smoke , a mist ) that is visible for a little while and then disappears [ into thin air ] .
59004015	You ought instead to say , If the Lord is willing , we shall live and we shall do this or that [ thing ] .
59004016	But as it is , you boast [ falsely ] in your presumption and your self-conceit . All such boasting is wrong .
59004017	So any person who knows what is right to do but does not do it , to him it is sin .
59005001	COME NOW , you rich [ people ] , weep aloud and lament over the miseries ( the woes ) that are surely coming upon you .
59005002	Your abundant wealth has rotted and is ruined , and your [ many ] garments have become moth-eaten .
59005003	Your gold and silver are completely rusted through , and their rust will be testimony against you and it will devour your flesh as if it were fire . You have heaped together treasure for the last days .
59005004	[ But ] look ! [ Here are ] the wages that you have withheld by fraud from the laborers who have reaped your fields , crying out [ for vengeance ] ; and the cries of the harvesters have come to the ears of the Lord of hosts .
59005005	[ Here ] on earth you have abandoned yourselves to soft ( prodigal ) living and to [ the pleasures of ] self-indulgence and self-gratification . You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned and have murdered the righteous ( innocent man ) , [ while ] he offers no resistance to you .
59005007	So be patient , brethren , [ as you wait ] till the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits expectantly for the precious harvest from the land . [ See how ] he keeps up his patient [ vigil ] over it until it receives the early and late rains .
59005008	So you also must be patient . Establish your hearts [ strengthen and confirm them in the final certainty ] , for the coming of the Lord is very near .
59005009	Do not complain , brethren , against one another , so that you [ yourselves ] may not be judged . Look ! The Judge is [ already ] standing at the very door .
59005010	[ As ] an example of suffering and ill-treatment together with patience , brethren , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord [ as His messengers ] .
59005011	You know how we call those blessed ( happy ) who were steadfast [ who endured ] . You have heard of the endurance of Job , and you have seen the Lord’s [ purpose and how He richly blessed him in the ] end , inasmuch as the Lord is full of pity and compassion and tenderness and mercy .
59005012	But above all [ things ] , my brethren , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath ; but let your yes be [ a simple ] yes , and your no be [ a simple ] no , so that you may not sin and fall under condemnation .
59005013	Is anyone among you afflicted ( ill-treated , suffering evil ) ? He should pray . Is anyone glad at heart ? He should sing praise [ to God ] .
59005014	Is anyone among you sick ? He should call in the church elders ( the spiritual guides ) . And they should pray over him , anointing him with oil in the Lord’s name .
59005015	And the prayer [ that is ] of faith will save him who is sick , and the Lord will restore him ; and if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
59005016	Confess to one another therefore your faults ( your slips , your false steps , your offenses , your sins ) and pray [ also ] for one another , that you may be healed and restored [ to a spiritual tone of mind and heart ] . The earnest ( heartfelt , continued ) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [ dynamic in its working ] .
59005017	Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have [ with feelings , affections , and a constitution like ours ] ; and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain , and no rain fell on the earth for three years and six months .
59005018	And [ then ] he prayed again and the heavens supplied rain and the land produced its crops [ as usual ] .
59005019	[ My ] brethren , if anyone among you strays from the Truth and falls into error and another [ person ] brings him back [ to God ] ,
59005020	Let the [ latter ] one be sure that whoever turns a sinner from his evil course will save [ that one’s ] soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins [ procure the pardon of the many sins committed by the convert ] .
60001001	PETER , AN apostle ( a special messenger ) of Jesus Christ , [ writing ] to the elect exiles of the dispersion scattered ( sowed ) abroad in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
60001002	Who were chosen and foreknown by God the Father and consecrated ( sanctified , made holy ) by the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and to be sprinkled with [ His ] blood : May grace ( spiritual blessing ) and peace be given you in increasing abundance [ that spiritual peace to be realized in and through Christ , freedom from fears , agitating passions , and moral conflicts ] .
60001003	Praised ( honored , blessed ) be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) ! By His boundless mercy we have been born again to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60001004	[ Born anew ] into an inheritance which is beyond the reach of change and decay [ imperishable ] , unsullied and unfading , reserved in heaven for you ,
60001005	Who are being guarded ( garrisoned ) by God’s power through [ your ] faith [ till you fully inherit that final ] salvation that is ready to be revealed [ for you ] in the last time .
60001006	[ You should ] be exceedingly glad on this account , though now for a little while you may be distressed by trials and suffer temptations ,
60001007	So that [ the genuineness ] of your faith may be tested , [ your faith ] which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire . [ This proving of your faith is intended ] to redound to [ your ] praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) is revealed .
60001008	Without having seen Him , you love Him ; though you do not [ even ] now see Him , you believe in Him and exult and thrill with inexpressible and glorious ( triumphant , heavenly ) joy .
60001009	[ At the same time ] you receive the result ( outcome , consummation ) of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
60001010	The prophets , who prophesied of the grace ( divine blessing ) which was intended for you , searched and inquired earnestly about this salvation .
60001011	They sought [ to find out ] to whom or when this was to come which the Spirit of Christ working within them was indicating when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow [ them ] .
60001012	It was then disclosed to them that the services they were rendering were not meant for themselves and their period of time , but for you . [ It is these very ] things which have now already been made known plainly to you by those who preached the good news ( the Gospel ) to you by the [ same ] Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Into these things [ the very ] angels long to look !
60001013	So brace up your minds ; be sober ( circumspect , morally alert ) ; set your hope wholly and unchangeably on the grace ( divine favor ) that is coming to you when Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) is revealed .
60001014	[ Live ] as children of obedience [ to God ] ; do not conform yourselves to the evil desires [ that governed you ] in your former ignorance [ when you did not know the requirements of the Gospel ] .
60001015	But as the One Who called you is holy , you yourselves also be holy in all your conduct and manner of living .
60001016	For it is written , You shall be holy , for I am holy .
60001017	And if you call upon Him as [ your ] Father Who judges each one impartially according to what he does , [ then ] you should conduct yourselves with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary residence [ on the earth , whether long or short ] .
60001018	You must know ( recognize ) that you were redeemed ( ransomed ) from the useless ( fruitless ) way of living inherited by tradition from [ your ] forefathers , not with corruptible things [ such as ] silver and gold ,
60001019	But [ you were purchased ] with the precious blood of Christ ( the Messiah ) , like that of a [ sacrificial ] lamb without blemish or spot .
60001020	It is true that He was chosen and foreordained ( destined and foreknown for it ) before the foundation of the world , but He was brought out to public view ( made manifest ) in these last days ( at the end of the times ) for the sake of you .
60001021	Through Him you believe in ( adhere to , rely on ) God , Who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him honor and glory , so that your faith and hope are [ centered and rest ] in God .
60001022	Since by your obedience to the Truth through the [ Holy ] Spirit you have purified your hearts for the sincere affection of the brethren , [ see that you ] love one another fervently from a pure heart .
60001023	You have been regenerated ( born again ) , not from a mortal origin ( seed , sperm ) , but from one that is immortal by the ever living and lasting Word of God .
60001024	For all flesh ( mankind ) is like grass , and all its glory ( honor ) like [ the ] flower of grass . The grass withers and the flower drops off ,
60001025	But the Word of the Lord ( divine instruction , the Gospel ) endures forever . And this Word is the good news which was preached to you .
60002001	SO BE done with every trace of wickedness ( depravity , malignity ) and all deceit and insincerity ( pretense , hypocrisy ) and grudges ( envy , jealousy ) and slander and evil speaking of every kind .
60002002	Like newborn babies you should crave ( thirst for , earnestly desire ) the pure ( unadulterated ) spiritual milk , that by it you may be nurtured and grow unto [ completed ] salvation ,
60002003	Since you have [ already ] tasted the goodness and kindness of the Lord .
60002004	Come to Him [ then , to that ] Living Stone which men tried and threw away , but which is chosen [ and ] precious in God’s sight .
60002005	[ Come ] and , like living stones , be yourselves built [ into ] a spiritual house , for a holy ( dedicated , consecrated ) priesthood , to offer up [ those ] spiritual sacrifices [ that are ] acceptable and pleasing to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	For thus it stands in Scripture : Behold , I am laying in Zion a chosen ( honored ) , precious chief Cornerstone , and he who believes in Him [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] shall never be disappointed or put to shame .
60002007	To you then who believe ( who adhere to , trust in , and rely on Him ) is the preciousness ; but for those who disbelieve [ it is true ] , The [ very ] Stone which the builders rejected has become the main Cornerstone ,
60002008	And , A Stone that will cause stumbling and a Rock that will give [ men ] offense ; they stumble because they disobey and disbelieve [ God’s ] Word , as those [ who reject Him ] were destined ( appointed ) to do .
60002009	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a dedicated nation , [ God’s ] own purchased , special people , that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light .
60002010	Once you were not a people [ at all ] , but now you are God’s people ; once you were unpitied , but now you are pitied and have received mercy .
60002011	Beloved , I implore you as aliens and strangers and exiles [ in this world ] to abstain from the sensual urges ( the evil desires , the passions of the flesh , your lower nature ) that wage war against the soul .
60002012	Conduct yourselves properly ( honorably , righteously ) among the Gentiles , so that , although they may slander you as evildoers , [ yet ] they may by witnessing your good deeds [ come to ] glorify God in the day of inspection [ when God shall look upon you wanderers as a pastor or shepherd looks over his flock ] .
60002013	Be submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of the Lord , whether it be to the emperor as supreme ,
60002014	Or to governors as sent by him to bring vengeance ( punishment , justice ) to those who do wrong and to encourage those who do good service .
60002015	For it is God’s will and intention that by doing right [ your good and honest lives ] should silence ( muzzle , gag ) the ignorant charges and ill-informed criticisms of foolish persons .
60002016	[ Live ] as free people , [ yet ] without employing your freedom as a pretext for wickedness ; but [ live at all times ] as servants of God .
60002017	Show respect for all men [ treat them honorably ] . Love the brotherhood ( the Christian fraternity of which Christ is the Head ) . Reverence God . Honor the emperor .
60002018	[ You who are ] household servants , be submissive to your masters with all [ proper ] respect , not only to those who are kind and considerate and reasonable , but also to those who are surly ( overbearing , unjust , and crooked ) .
60002019	For one is regarded favorably ( is approved , acceptable , and thankworthy ) if , as in the sight of God , he endures the pain of unjust suffering .
60002020	[ After all ] what kind of glory [ is there in it ] if , when you do wrong and are punished for it , you take it patiently ? But if you bear patiently with suffering [ which results ] when you do right and that is undeserved , it is acceptable and pleasing to God .
60002021	For even to this were you called [ it is inseparable from your vocation ] . For Christ also suffered for you , leaving you [ His personal ] example , so that you should follow in His footsteps .
60002022	He was guilty of no sin , neither was deceit ( guile ) ever found on His lips .
60002023	When He was reviled and insulted , He did not revile or offer insult in return ; [ when ] He was abused and suffered , He made no threats [ of vengeance ] ; but he trusted [ Himself and everything ] to Him Who judges fairly .
60002024	He personally bore our sins in His [ own ] body on the tree [ as on an altar and offered Himself on it ] , that we might die ( cease to exist ) to sin and live to righteousness . By His wounds you have been healed .
60002025	For you were going astray like [ so many ] sheep , but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Guardian ( the Bishop ) of your souls .
60003001	IN LIKE manner , you married women , be submissive to your own husbands [ subordinate yourselves as being secondary to and dependent on them , and adapt yourselves to them ] , so that even if any do not obey the Word [ of God ] , they may be won over not by discussion but by the [ godly ] lives of their wives ,
60003002	When they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves , together with your reverence [ for your husband ; you are to feel for him all that reverence includes : to respect , defer to , revere him -- to honor , esteem , appreciate , prize , and , in the human sense , to adore him , that is , to admire , praise , be devoted to , deeply love , and enjoy your husband ] .
60003003	Let not yours be the [ merely ] external adorning with [ elaborate ] interweaving and knotting of the hair , the wearing of jewelry , or changes of clothes ;
60003004	But let it be the inward adorning and beauty of the hidden person of the heart , with the incorruptible and unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit , which [ is not anxious or wrought up , but ] is very precious in the sight of God .
60003005	For it was thus that the pious women of old who hoped in God were [ accustomed ] to beautify themselves and were submissive to their husbands [ adapting themselves to them as themselves secondary and dependent upon them ] .
60003006	It was thus that Sarah obeyed Abraham [ following his guidance and acknowledging his headship over her by ] calling him lord ( master , leader , authority ) . And you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you [ not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you ] .
60003007	In the same way you married men should live considerately with [ your wives ] , with an intelligent recognition [ of the marriage relation ] , honoring the woman as [ physically ] the weaker , but [ realizing that you ] are joint heirs of the grace ( God’s unmerited favor ) of life , in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off . [ Otherwise you cannot pray effectively . ]
60003008	Finally , all [ of you ] should be of one and the same mind ( united in spirit ) , sympathizing [ with one another ] , loving [ each other ] as brethren [ of one household ] , compassionate and courteous ( tenderhearted and humble ) .
60003009	Never return evil for evil or insult for insult ( scolding , tongue-lashing , berating ) , but on the contrary blessing [ praying for their welfare , happiness , and protection , and truly pitying and loving them ] . For know that to this you have been called , that you may yourselves inherit a blessing [ from God -- that you may obtain a blessing as heirs , bringing welfare and happiness and protection ] .
60003010	For let him who wants to enjoy life and see good days [ good -- whether apparent or not ] keep his tongue free from evil and his lips from guile ( treachery , deceit ) .
60003011	Let him turn away from wickedness and shun it , and let him do right . Let him search for peace ( harmony ; undisturbedness from fears , agitating passions , and moral conflicts ) and seek it eagerly . [ Do not merely desire peaceful relations with God , with your fellowmen , and with yourself , but pursue , go after them ! ]
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God ) , and His ears are attentive to their prayer . But the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil [ to oppose them , to frustrate , and defeat them ] .
60003013	Now who is there to hurt you if you are zealous followers of that which is good ?
60003014	But even in case you should suffer for the sake of righteousness , [ you are ] blessed ( happy , to be envied ) . Do not dread or be afraid of their threats , nor be disturbed [ by their opposition ] .
60003015	But in your hearts set Christ apart as holy [ and acknowledge Him ] as Lord . Always be ready to give a logical defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope that is in you , but do it courteously and respectfully .
60003016	[ And see to it that ] your conscience is entirely clear ( unimpaired ) , so that , when you are falsely accused as evildoers , those who threaten you abusively and revile your right behavior in Christ may come to be ashamed [ of slandering your good lives ] .
60003017	For [ it is ] better to suffer [ unjustly ] for doing right , if that should be God’s will , than to suffer [ justly ] for doing wrong .
60003018	For Christ [ the Messiah Himself ] died for sins once for all , the Righteous for the unrighteous ( the Just for the unjust , the Innocent for the guilty ) , that He might bring us to God . In His human body He was put to death , but He was made alive in the spirit ,
60003019	In which He went and preached to the spirits in prison ,
60003020	[ The souls of those ] who long before in the days of Noah had been disobedient , when God’s patience waited during the building of the ark in which a few [ people ] , actually eight in number , were saved through water .
60003021	And baptism , which is a figure [ of their deliverance ] , does now also save you [ from inward questionings and fears ] , not by the removing of outward body filth [ bathing ] , but by [ providing you with ] the answer of a good and clear conscience ( inward cleanness and peace ) before God [ because you are demonstrating what you believe to be yours ] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
60003022	[ And He ] has now entered into heaven and is at the right hand of God , with [ all ] angels and authorities and powers made subservient to Him .
60004001	SO , SINCE Christ suffered in the flesh for us , for you , arm yourselves with the same thought and purpose [ patiently to suffer rather than fail to please God ] . For whoever has suffered in the flesh [ having the mind of Christ ] is done with [ intentional ] sin [ has stopped pleasing himself and the world , and pleases God ] ,
60004002	So that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living by [ his ] human appetites and desires , but [ he lives ] for what God wills .
60004003	For the time that is past already suffices for doing what the Gentiles like to do -- living [ as you have done ] in shameless , insolent wantonness , in lustful desires , drunkenness , reveling , drinking bouts and abominable , lawless idolatries .
60004004	They are astonished and think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation , and they abuse [ you ] .
60004005	But they will have to give an account to Him Who is ready to judge and pass sentence on the living and the dead .
60004006	For this is why the good news ( the Gospel ) was preached [ in their lifetime ] even to the dead , that though judged in fleshly bodies as men are , they might live in the spirit as God does .
60004007	But the end and culmination of all things has now come near ; keep sound minded and self-restrained and alert therefore for [ the practice of ] prayer .
60004008	Above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another , for love covers a multitude of sins [ forgives and disregards the offenses of others ] .
60004009	Practice hospitality to one another ( those of the household of faith ) . [ Be hospitable , be a lover of strangers , with brotherly affection for the unknown guests , the foreigners , the poor , and all others who come your way who are of Christ’s body . ] And [ in each instance ] do it ungrudgingly ( cordially and graciously , without complaining but as representing Him ) .
60004010	As each of you has received a gift ( a particular spiritual talent , a gracious divine endowment ) , employ it for one another as [ befits ] good trustees of God’s many-sided grace [ faithful stewards of the extremely diverse powers and gifts granted to Christians by unmerited favor ] .
60004011	Whoever speaks , [ let him do it as one who utters ] oracles of God ; whoever renders service , [ let him do it ] as with the strength which God furnishes abundantly , so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . To Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever ( through endless ages ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
60004012	Beloved , do not be amazed and bewildered at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test your quality , as though something strange ( unusual and alien to you and your position ) were befalling you .
60004013	But insofar as you are sharing Christ’s sufferings , rejoice , so that when His glory [ full of radiance and splendor ] is revealed , you may also rejoice with triumph [ exultantly ] .
60004014	If you are censured and suffer abuse [ because you bear ] the name of Christ , blessed [ are you -- happy , fortunate , to be envied , with life-joy , and satisfaction in God’s favor and salvation , regardless of your outward condition ] , because the Spirit of glory , the Spirit of God , is resting upon you . On their part He is blasphemed , but on your part He is glorified .
60004015	But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or any sort of criminal , or as a mischief-maker ( a meddler ) in the affairs of others [ infringing on their rights ] .
60004016	But if [ one is ill-treated and suffers ] as a Christian [ which he is contemptuously called ] , let him not be ashamed , but give glory to God that he is [ deemed worthy to suffer ] in this name .
60004017	For the time [ has arrived ] for judgment to begin with the household of God ; and if it begins with us , what will [ be ] the end of those who do not respect or believe or obey the good news ( the Gospel ) of God ?
60004018	And if the righteous are barely saved , what will become of the godless and wicked ?
60004019	Therefore , those who are ill-treated and suffer in accordance with God’s will must do right and commit their souls [ in charge as a deposit ] to the One Who created [ them ] and will never fail [ them ] .
60005001	I WARN and counsel the elders among you ( the pastors and spiritual guides of the church ) as a fellow elder and as an eyewitness [ called to testify ] of the sufferings of Christ , as well as a sharer in the glory ( the honor and splendor ) that is to be revealed ( disclosed , unfolded ) :
60005002	Tend ( nurture , guard , guide , and fold ) the flock of God that is [ your responsibility ] , not by coercion or constraint , but willingly ; not dishonorably motivated by the advantages and profits [ belonging to the office ] , but eagerly and cheerfully ;
60005003	Not domineering [ as arrogant , dictatorial , and overbearing persons ] over those in your charge , but being examples ( patterns and models of Christian living ) to the flock ( the congregation ) .
60005004	And [ then ] when the Chief Shepherd is revealed , you will win the conqueror’s crown of glory .
60005005	Likewise , you who are younger and of lesser rank , be subject to the elders ( the ministers and spiritual guides of the church ) -- [ giving them due respect and yielding to their counsel ] . Clothe ( apron ) yourselves , all of you , with humility [ as the garb of a servant , so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from you , with freedom from pride and arrogance ] toward one another . For God sets Himself against the proud ( the insolent , the overbearing , the disdainful , the presumptuous , the boastful ) -- [ and He opposes , frustrates , and defeats them ] , but gives grace ( favor , blessing ) to the humble .
60005006	Therefore humble yourselves [ demote , lower yourselves in your own estimation ] under the mighty hand of God , that in due time He may exalt you ,
60005007	Casting the whole of your care [ all your anxieties , all your worries , all your concerns , once and for all ] on Him , for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully .
60005008	Be well balanced ( temperate , sober of mind ) , be vigilant and cautious at all times ; for that enemy of yours , the devil , roams around like a lion roaring [ in fierce hunger ] , seeking someone to seize upon and devour .
60005009	Withstand him ; be firm in faith [ against his onset -- rooted , established , strong , immovable , and determined ] , knowing that the same ( identical ) sufferings are appointed to your brotherhood ( the whole body of Christians ) throughout the world .
60005010	And after you have suffered a little while , the God of all grace [ Who imparts all blessing and favor ] , Who has called you to His [ own ] eternal glory in Christ Jesus , will Himself complete and make you what you ought to be , establish and ground you securely , and strengthen , and settle you .
60005011	To Him be the dominion ( power , authority , rule ) forever and ever . Amen ( so be it ) .
60005012	By Silvanus , a true ( loyal , consistent , incorruptible ) brother , as I consider him , I have written briefly to you , to counsel and urge and stimulate [ you ] and to declare [ to you ] that this is the true [ account of the ] grace ( the undeserved favor ) of God . Be steadfast and persevere in it .
60005013	She [ your sister church here ] in Babylon , [ who is ] elect ( chosen ) with [ yourselves ] , sends you greetings , and [ so does ] my son ( disciple ) Mark .
60005014	Salute one another with a kiss of love [ the symbol of mutual affection ] . To all of you that are in Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , may there be peace ( every kind of peace and blessing , especially peace with God , and freedom from fears , agitating passions , and moral conflicts ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
61001001	SIMON PETER , a servant and apostle ( special messenger ) of Jesus Christ , to those who have received ( obtained an equal privilege of ) like precious faith with ourselves in and through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ :
61001002	May grace ( God’s favor ) and peace ( which is perfect well-being , all necessary good , all spiritual prosperity , and freedom from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts ) be multiplied to you in [ the full , personal , precise , and correct ] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord .
61001003	For His divine power has bestowed upon us all things that [ are requisite and suited ] to life and godliness , through the [ full , personal ] knowledge of Him Who called us by and to His own glory and excellence ( virtue ) .
61001004	By means of these He has bestowed on us His precious and exceedingly great promises , so that through them you may escape [ by flight ] from the moral decay ( rottenness and corruption ) that is in the world because of covetousness ( lust and greed ) , and become sharers ( partakers ) of the divine nature .
61001005	For this very reason , adding your diligence [ to the divine promises ] , employ every effort in exercising your faith to develop virtue ( excellence , resolution , Christian energy ) , and in [ exercising ] virtue [ develop ] knowledge ( intelligence ) ,
61001006	And in [ exercising ] knowledge [ develop ] self-control , and in [ exercising ] self-control [ develop ] steadfastness ( patience , endurance ) , and in [ exercising ] steadfastness [ develop ] godliness ( piety ) ,
61001007	And in [ exercising ] godliness [ develop ] brotherly affection , and in [ exercising ] brotherly affection [ develop ] Christian love .
61001008	For as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you , they will keep [ you ] from being idle or unfruitful unto the [ full personal ] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
61001009	For whoever lacks these qualities is blind , [ spiritually ] shortsighted , seeing only what is near to him , and has become oblivious [ to the fact ] that he was cleansed from his old sins .
61001010	Because of this , brethren , be all the more solicitous and eager to make sure ( to ratify , to strengthen , to make steadfast ) your calling and election ; for if you do this , you will never stumble or fall .
61001011	Thus there will be richly and abundantly provided for you entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	So I intend always to remind you about these things , although indeed you know them and are firm in the truth that [ you ] now [ hold ] .
61001013	I think it right , as long as I am in this tabernacle ( tent , body ) , to stir you up by way of remembrance ,
61001014	Since I know that the laying aside of this body of mine will come speedily , as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me .
61001015	Moreover , I will diligently endeavor [ to see to it ] that [ even ] after my departure ( decease ) you may be able at all times to call these things to mind .
61001016	For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty ( grandeur , authority of sovereign power ) .
61001017	For when He was invested with honor and glory from God the Father and a voice was borne to Him by the [ splendid ] Majestic Glory [ in the bright cloud that overshadowed Him , saying ] , This is My beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased and delight ,
61001018	We [ actually ] heard this voice borne out of heaven , for we were together with Him on the holy mountain .
61001019	And we have the prophetic word [ made ] firmer still . You will do well to pay close attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dismal ( squalid and dark ) place , until the day breaks through [ the gloom ] and the Morning Star rises ( comes into being ) in your hearts .
61001020	[ Yet ] first [ you must ] understand this , that no prophecy of Scripture is [ a matter ] of any personal or private or special interpretation ( loosening , solving ) .
61001021	For no prophecy ever originated because some man willed it [ to do so -- it never came by human impulse ] , but men spoke from God who were borne along ( moved and impelled ) by the Holy Spirit .
61002001	BUT ALSO [ in those days ] there arose false prophets among the people , just as there will be false teachers among yourselves , who will subtly and stealthily introduce heretical doctrines ( destructive heresies ) , even denying and disowning the Master Who bought them , bringing upon themselves swift destruction .
61002002	And many will follow their immoral ways and lascivious doings ; because of them the true Way will be maligned and defamed .
61002003	And in their covetousness ( lust , greed ) they will exploit you with false ( cunning ) arguments . From of old the sentence [ of condemnation ] for them has not been idle ; their destruction ( eternal misery ) has not been asleep .
61002004	For God did not [ even ] spare angels that sinned , but cast them into hell , delivering them to be kept there in pits of gloom till the judgment and their doom .
61002005	And He spared not the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a preacher of righteousness , with seven other persons , when He brought a flood upon the world of ungodly [ people ] .
61002006	And He condemned to ruin and extinction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , reducing them to ashes [ and thus ] set them forth as an example to those who would be ungodly ;
61002007	And He rescued righteous Lot , greatly worn out and distressed by the wanton ways of the ungodly and lawless --
61002008	For that just man , living [ there ] among them , tortured his righteous soul every day with what he saw and heard of [ their ] unlawful and wicked deeds --
61002009	Now if [ all these things are true , then be sure ] the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptations and trials , and how to keep the ungodly under chastisement until the day of judgment and doom ,
61002010	And particularly those who walk after the flesh and indulge in the lust of polluting passion and scorn and despise authority . Presumptuous [ and ] daring [ self-willed and self-loving creatures ] ! They scoff at and revile dignitaries ( glorious ones ) without trembling ,
61002011	Whereas [ even ] angels , though superior in might and power , do not bring a defaming charge against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these [ people ] ! Like unreasoning beasts , mere creatures of instinct , born [ only ] to be captured and destroyed , railing at things of which they are ignorant , they shall utterly perish in their [ own ] corruption [ in their destroying they shall surely be destroyed ] ,
61002013	Being destined to receive [ punishment as ] the reward of [ their ] unrighteousness [ suffering wrong as the hire for their wrongdoing ] . They count it a delight to revel in the daytime [ living luxuriously and delicately ] . They are blots and blemishes , reveling in their deceptions and carousing together [ even ] as they feast with you .
61002014	They have eyes full of harlotry , insatiable for sin . They beguile and bait and lure away unstable souls . Their hearts are trained in covetousness ( lust , greed ) , [ they are ] children of a curse [ exposed to cursing ] !
61002015	Forsaking the straight road they have gone astray ; they have followed the way of Balaam [ the son ] of Beor , who loved the reward of wickedness .
61002016	But he was rebuked for his own transgression when a dumb beast of burden spoke with human voice and checked the prophet’s madness .
61002017	These are springs without water and mists driven along before a tempest , for whom is reserved forever the gloom of darkness .
61002018	For uttering loud boasts of folly , they beguile and lure with lustful desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from them who are wrongdoers .
61002019	They promise them liberty , when they themselves are the slaves of depravity and defilement -- for by whatever anyone is made inferior or worse or is overcome , to that [ person or thing ] he is enslaved .
61002020	For if , after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through [ the full , personal ] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they again become entangled in them and are overcome , their last condition is worse [ for them ] than the first .
61002021	For never to have obtained a [ full , personal ] knowledge of the way of righteousness would have been better for them than , having obtained [ such knowledge ] , to turn back from the holy commandment which was [ verbally ] delivered to them .
61002022	There has befallen them the thing spoken of in the true proverb , The dog turns back to his own vomit , and , The sow is washed only to wallow again in the mire .
61003001	BELOVED , I am now writing you this second letter . In [ both of ] them I have stirred up your unsullied ( sincere ) mind by way of remembrance ,
61003002	That you should recall the predictions of the holy ( consecrated , dedicated ) prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior [ given ] through your apostles ( His special messengers ) .
61003003	To begin with , you must know and understand this , that scoffers ( mockers ) will come in the last days with scoffing , [ people who ] walk after their own fleshly desires
61003004	And say , Where is the promise of His coming ? For since the forefathers fell asleep , all things have continued exactly as they did from the beginning of creation .
61003005	For they willfully overlook and forget this [ fact ] , that the heavens [ came into ] existence long ago by the word of God , and the earth also which was formed out of water and by means of water ,
61003006	Through which the world that then [ existed ] was deluged with water and perished .
61003007	But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been stored up ( reserved ) for fire , being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly people .
61003008	Nevertheless , do not let this one fact escape you , beloved , that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day .
61003009	The Lord does not delay and is not tardy or slow about what He promises , according to some people’s conception of slowness , but He is long-suffering ( extraordinarily patient ) toward you , not desiring that any should perish , but that all should turn to repentance .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief , and then the heavens will vanish ( pass away ) with a thunderous crash , and the [ material ] elements [ of the universe ] will be dissolved with fire , and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up .
61003011	Since all these things are thus in the process of being dissolved , what kind of person ought [ each of ] you to be [ in the meanwhile ] in consecrated and holy behavior and devout and godly qualities ,
61003012	While you wait and earnestly long for ( expect and hasten ) the coming of the day of God by reason of which the flaming heavens will be dissolved , and the [ material ] elements [ of the universe ] will flare and melt with fire ?
61003013	But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise , in which righteousness ( uprightness , freedom from sin , and right standing with God ) is to abide .
61003014	So , beloved , since you are expecting these things , be eager to be found by Him [ at His coming ] without spot or blemish and at peace [ in serene confidence , free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts ] .
61003015	And consider that the long-suffering of our Lord [ His slowness in avenging wrongs and judging the world ] is salvation ( that which is conducive to the soul’s safety ) , even as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the spiritual insight given him ,
61003016	Speaking of this as he does in all of his letters . There are some things in those [ epistles of Paul ] that are difficult to understand , which the ignorant and unstable twist and misconstrue to their own utter destruction , just as [ they distort and misinterpret ] the rest of the Scriptures .
61003017	Let me warn you therefore , beloved , that knowing these things beforehand , you should be on your guard , lest you be carried away by the error of lawless and wicked [ persons and ] fall from your own [ present ] firm condition [ your own steadfastness of mind ] .
61003018	But grow in grace ( undeserved favor , spiritual strength ) and recognition and knowledge and understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . To Him [ be ] glory ( honor , majesty , and splendor ) both now and to the day of eternity . Amen ( so be it ) !
62001001	[ WE ARE writing ] about the Word of Life [ in ] Him Who existed from the beginning , Whom we have heard , Whom we have seen with our [ own ] eyes , Whom we have gazed upon [ for ourselves ] and have touched with our [ own ] hands .
62001002	And the Life [ an aspect of His being ] was revealed ( made manifest , demonstrated ) , and we saw [ as eyewitnesses ] and are testifying to and declare to you the Life , the eternal Life [ in Him ] Who already existed with the Father and Who [ actually ] was made visible ( was revealed ) to us [ His followers ] .
62001003	What we have seen and [ ourselves ] heard , we are also telling you , so that you too may realize and enjoy fellowship as partners and partakers with us . And [ this ] fellowship that we have [ which is a distinguishing mark of Christians ] is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
62001004	And we are now writing these things to you so that our joy [ in seeing you included ] may be full [ and your joy may be complete ] .
62001005	And this is the message [ the message of promise ] which we have heard from Him and now are reporting to you : God is Light , and there is no darkness in Him at all [ no , not in any way ] .
62001006	[ So ] if we say we are partakers together and enjoy fellowship with Him when we live and move and are walking about in darkness , we are [ both ] speaking falsely and do not live and practice the Truth [ which the Gospel presents ] .
62001007	But if we [ really ] are living and walking in the Light , as He [ Himself ] is in the Light , we have [ true , unbroken ] fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses ( removes ) us from all sin and guilt [ keeps us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations ] .
62001008	If we say we have no sin [ refusing to admit that we are sinners ] , we delude and lead ourselves astray , and the Truth [ which the Gospel presents ] is not in us [ does not dwell in our hearts ] .
62001009	If we [ freely ] admit that we have sinned and confess our sins , He is faithful and just ( true to His own nature and promises ) and will forgive our sins [ dismiss our lawlessness ] and [ continuously ] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [ everything not in conformity to His will in purpose , thought , and action ] .
62001010	If we say ( claim ) we have not sinned , we contradict His Word and make Him out to be false and a liar , and His Word is not in us [ the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts ] .
62002001	MY LITTLE children , I write you these things so that you may not violate God’s law and sin . But if anyone should sin , we have an Advocate ( One Who will intercede for us ) with the Father -- [ it is ] Jesus Christ [ the all ] righteous [ upright , just , Who conforms to the Father’s will in every purpose , thought , and action ] .
62002002	And He [ that same Jesus Himself ] is the propitiation ( the atoning sacrifice ) for our sins , and not for ours alone but also for [ the sins of ] the whole world .
62002003	And this is how we may discern [ daily , by experience ] that we are coming to know Him [ to perceive , recognize , understand , and become better acquainted with Him ] : if we keep ( bear in mind , observe , practice ) His teachings ( precepts , commandments ) .
62002004	Whoever says , I know Him [ I perceive , recognize , understand , and am acquainted with Him ] but fails to keep and obey His commandments ( teachings ) is a liar , and the Truth [ of the Gospel ] is not in him .
62002005	But he who keeps ( treasures ) His Word [ who bears in mind His precepts , who observes His message in its entirety ] , truly in him has the love of and for God been perfected ( completed , reached maturity ) . By this we may perceive ( know , recognize , and be sure ) that we are in Him :
62002006	Whoever says he abides in Him ought [ as a personal debt ] to walk and conduct himself in the same way in which He walked and conducted Himself .
62002007	Beloved , I am writing you no new commandment , but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning ; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [ the doctrine of salvation through Christ ] .
62002008	Yet I am writing you a new commandment , which is true ( is realized ) in Him and in you , because the darkness ( moral blindness ) is clearing away and the true Light ( the revelation of God in Christ ) is already shining .
62002009	Whoever says he is in the Light and [ yet ] hates his brother [ Christian , born-again child of God his Father ] is in darkness even until now .
62002010	Whoever loves his brother [ believer ] abides ( lives ) in the Light , and in It or in him there is no occasion for stumbling or cause for error or sin .
62002011	But he who hates ( detests , despises ) his brother [ in Christ ] is in darkness and walking ( living ) in the dark ; he is straying and does not perceive or know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
62002012	I am writing to you , little children , because for His name’s sake your sins are forgiven [ pardoned through His name and on account of confessing His name ] .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , because you have come to know ( recognize , be aware of , and understand ) Him Who [ has existed ] from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because you have been victorious over the wicked [ one ] . I write to you , boys ( lads ) , because you have come to know ( recognize and be aware ) of the Father .
62002014	I write to you , fathers , because you have come to know ( recognize , be conscious of , and understand ) Him Who [ has existed ] from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you are strong and vigorous , and the Word of God is [ always ] abiding in you ( in your hearts ) , and you have been victorious over the wicked one .
62002015	Do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world . If anyone loves the world , love for the Father is not in him .
62002016	For all that is in the world -- the lust of the flesh [ craving for sensual gratification ] and the lust of the eyes [ greedy longings of the mind ] and the pride of life [ assurance in one’s own resources or in the stability of earthly things ] -- these do not come from the Father but are from the world [ itself ] .
62002017	And the world passes away and disappears , and with it the forbidden cravings ( the passionate desires , the lust ) of it ; but he who does the will of God and carries out His purposes in his life abides ( remains ) forever .
62002018	Boys ( lads ) , it is the last time ( hour , the end of this age ) . And as you have heard that the antichrist [ he who will oppose Christ in the guise of Christ ] is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen , which confirms our belief that it is the final ( the end ) time .
62002019	They went out from our number , but they did not [ really ] belong to us ; for if they had been of us , they would have remained with us . But [ they withdrew ] that it might be plain that they all are not of us .
62002020	But you have been anointed by [ you hold a sacred appointment from , you have been given an unction from ] the Holy One , and you all know [ the Truth ] or you know all things .
62002021	I write to you not because you are ignorant and do not perceive and know the Truth , but because you do perceive and know it , and [ know positively ] that nothing false ( no deception , no lie ) is of the Truth .
62002022	Who is [ such a ] liar as he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ( the Messiah ) ? He is the antichrist ( the antagonist of Christ ) , who [ habitually ] denies and refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one who [ habitually ] denies ( disowns ) the Son even has the Father . Whoever confesses ( acknowledges and has ) the Son has the Father also .
62002024	As for you , keep in your hearts what you have heard from the beginning . If what you heard from the first dwells and remains in you , then you will dwell in the Son and in the Father [ always ] .
62002025	And this is what He Himself has promised us -- the life , the eternal [ life ] .
62002026	I write this to you with reference to those who would deceive you [ seduce and lead you astray ] .
62002027	But as for you , the anointing ( the sacred appointment , the unction ) which you received from Him abides [ permanently ] in you ; [ so ] then you have no need that anyone should instruct you . But just as His anointing teaches you concerning everything and is true and is no falsehood , so you must abide in ( live in , never depart from ) Him [ being rooted in Him , knit to Him ] , just as [ His anointing ] has taught you [ to do ] .
62002028	And now , little children , abide ( live , remain permanently ) in Him , so that when He is made visible , we may have and enjoy perfect confidence ( boldness , assurance ) and not be ashamed and shrink from Him at His coming .
62002029	If you know ( perceive and are sure ) that He [ Christ ] is [ absolutely ] righteous [ conforming to the Father’s will in purpose , thought , and action ] , you may also know ( be sure ) that everyone who does righteously [ and is therefore in like manner conformed to the divine will ] is born ( begotten ) of Him [ God ] .
62003001	SEE WHAT [ an incredible ] quality of love the Father has given ( shown , bestowed on ) us , that we should [ be permitted to ] be named and called and counted the children of God ! And so we are ! The reason that the world does not know ( recognize , acknowledge ) us is that it does not know ( recognize , acknowledge ) Him .
62003002	Beloved , we are [ even here and ] now God’s children ; it is not yet disclosed ( made clear ) what we shall be [ hereafter ] , but we know that when He comes and is manifested , we shall [ as God’s children ] resemble and be like Him , for we shall see Him just as He [ really ] is .
62003003	And everyone who has this hope [ resting ] on Him cleanses ( purifies ) himself just as He is pure ( chaste , undefiled , guiltless ) .
62003004	Everyone who commits ( practices ) sin is guilty of lawlessness ; for [ that is what ] sin is , lawlessness ( the breaking , violating of God’s law by transgression or neglect -- being unrestrained and unregulated by His commands and His will ) .
62003005	You know that He appeared in visible form and became Man to take away [ upon Himself ] sins , and in Him there is no sin [ essentially and forever ] .
62003006	No one who abides in Him [ who lives and remains in communion with and in obedience to Him -- deliberately , knowingly , and habitually ] commits ( practices ) sin . No one who [ habitually ] sins has either seen or known Him [ recognized , perceived , or understood Him , or has had an experiential acquaintance with Him ] .
62003007	Boys ( lads ) , let no one deceive and lead you astray . He who practices righteousness [ who is upright , conforming to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action , living a consistently conscientious life ] is righteous , even as He is righteous .
62003008	[ But ] he who commits sin [ who practices evildoing ] is of the devil [ takes his character from the evil one ] , for the devil has sinned ( violated the divine law ) from the beginning . The reason the Son of God was made manifest ( visible ) was to undo ( destroy , loosen , and dissolve ) the works the devil [ has done ] .
62003009	No one born ( begotten ) of God [ deliberately , knowingly , and habitually ] practices sin , for God’s nature abides in him [ His principle of life , the divine sperm , remains permanently within him ] ; and he cannot practice sinning because he is born ( begotten ) of God .
62003010	By this it is made clear who take their nature from God and are His children and who take their nature from the devil and are his children : no one who does not practice righteousness [ who does not conform to God’s will in purpose , thought , and action ] is of God ; neither is anyone who does not love his brother ( his fellow believer in Christ ) .
62003011	For this is the message ( the announcement ) which you have heard from the first , that we should love one another ,
62003012	[ And ] not be like Cain who [ took his nature and got his motivation ] from the evil one and slew his brother . And why did he slay him ? Because his deeds ( activities , works ) were wicked and malicious and his brother’s were righteous ( virtuous ) .
62003013	Do not be surprised and wonder , brethren , that the world detests and pursues you with hatred .
62003014	We know that we have passed over out of death into Life by the fact that we love the brethren ( our fellow Christians ) . He who does not love abides ( remains , is held and kept continually ) in [ spiritual ] death .
62003015	Anyone who hates ( abominates , detests ) his brother [ in Christ ] is [ at heart ] a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding ( persevering ) within him .
62003016	By this we come to know ( progressively to recognize , to perceive , to understand ) the [ essential ] love : that He laid down His [ own ] life for us ; and we ought to lay [ our ] lives down for [ those who are our ] brothers [ in Him ] .
62003017	But if anyone has this world’s goods ( resources for sustaining life ) and sees his brother and fellow believer in need , yet closes his heart of compassion against him , how can the love of God live and remain in him ?
62003018	Little children , let us not love [ merely ] in theory or in speech but in deed and in truth ( in practice and in sincerity ) .
62003019	By this we shall come to know ( perceive , recognize , and understand ) that we are of the Truth , and can reassure ( quiet , conciliate , and pacify ) our hearts in His presence ,
62003020	Whenever our hearts in [ tormenting ] self-accusation make us feel guilty and condemn us . [ For we are in God’s hands . ] For He is above and greater than our consciences ( our hearts ) , and He knows ( perceives and understands ) everything [ nothing is hidden from Him ] .
62003021	And , beloved , if our consciences ( our hearts ) do not accuse us [ if they do not make us feel guilty and condemn us ] , we have confidence ( complete assurance and boldness ) before God ,
62003022	And we receive from Him whatever we ask , because we [ watchfully ] obey His orders [ observe His suggestions and injunctions , follow His plan for us ] and [ habitually ] practice what is pleasing to Him .
62003023	And this is His order ( His command , His injunction ) : that we should believe in ( put our faith and trust in and adhere to and rely on ) the name of His Son Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , and that we should love one another , just as He has commanded us .
62003024	All who keep His commandments [ who obey His orders and follow His plan , live and continue to live , to stay and ] abide in Him , and He in them . [ They let Christ be a home to them and they are the home of Christ . ] And by this we know and understand and have the proof that He [ really ] lives and makes His home in us : by the [ Holy ] Spirit Whom He has given us .
62004001	BELOVED , DO not put faith in every spirit , but prove ( test ) the spirits to discover whether they proceed from God ; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world .
62004002	By this you may know ( perceive and recognize ) the Spirit of God : every spirit which acknowledges and confesses [ the fact ] that Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) [ actually ] has become man and has come in the flesh is of God [ has God for its source ] ;
62004003	And every spirit which does not acknowledge and confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh [ but would annul , destroy , sever , disunite Him ] is not of God [ does not proceed from Him ] . This [ nonconfession ] is the [ spirit ] of the antichrist , [ of ] which you heard that it was coming , and now it is already in the world .
62004004	Little children , you are of God [ you belong to Him ] and have [ already ] defeated and overcome them [ the agents of the antichrist ] , because He Who lives in you is greater ( mightier ) than he who is in the world .
62004005	They proceed from the world and are of the world ; therefore it is out of the world [ its whole economy morally considered ] that they speak , and the world listens ( pays attention ) to them .
62004006	We are [ children ] of God . Whoever is learning to know God [ progressively to perceive , recognize , and understand God by observation and experience , and to get an ever-clearer knowledge of Him ] listens to us ; and he who is not of God does not listen or pay attention to us . By this we know ( recognize ) the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error .
62004007	Beloved , let us love one another , for love is ( springs ) from God ; and he who loves [ his fellowmen ] is begotten ( born ) of God and is coming [ progressively ] to know and understand God [ to perceive and recognize and get a better and clearer knowledge of Him ] .
62004008	He who does not love has not become acquainted with God [ does not and never did know Him ] , for God is love .
62004009	In this the love of God was made manifest ( displayed ) where we are concerned : in that God sent His Son , the only begotten or unique [ Son ] , into the world so that we might live through Him .
62004010	In this is love : not that we loved God , but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation ( the atoning sacrifice ) for our sins .
62004011	Beloved , if God loved us so [ very much ] , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No man has at any time [ yet ] seen God . But if we love one another , God abides ( lives and remains ) in us and His love ( that love which is essentially His ) is brought to completion ( to its full maturity , runs its full course , is perfected ) in us !
62004013	By this we come to know ( perceive , recognize , and understand ) that we abide ( live and remain ) in Him and He in us : because He has given ( imparted ) to us of His [ Holy ] Spirit .
62004014	And [ besides ] we ourselves have seen ( have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated ) and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [ as the ] Savior of the world .
62004015	Anyone who confesses ( acknowledges , owns ) that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides ( lives , makes His home ) in him and he [ abides , lives , makes his home ] in God .
62004016	And we know ( understand , recognize , are conscious of , by observation and by experience ) and believe ( adhere to and put faith in and rely on ) the love God cherishes for us . God is love , and he who dwells and continues in love dwells and continues in God , and God dwells and continues in him .
62004017	In this [ union and communion with Him ] love is brought to completion and attains perfection with us , that we may have confidence for the day of judgment [ with assurance and boldness to face Him ] , because as He is , so are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love [ dread does not exist ] , but full-grown ( complete , perfect ) love turns fear out of doors and expels every trace of terror ! For fear brings with it the thought of punishment , and [ so ] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [ is not yet grown into love’s complete perfection ] .
62004019	We love Him , because He first loved us .
62004020	If anyone says , I love God , and hates ( detests , abominates ) his brother [ in Christ ] , he is a liar ; for he who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , Whom he has not seen .
62004021	And this command ( charge , order , injunction ) we have from Him : that he who loves God shall love his brother [ believer ] also .
62005001	EVERYONE WHO believes ( adheres to , trusts , and relies on the fact ) that Jesus is the Christ ( the Messiah ) is a born-again child of God ; and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of Him ( His offspring ) .
62005002	By this we come to know ( recognize and understand ) that we love the children of God : when we love God and obey His commands ( orders , charges ) -- [ when we keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and His teaching ] .
62005003	For the [ true ] love of God is this : that we do His commands [ keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching ] . And these orders of His are not irksome ( burdensome , oppressive , or grievous ) .
62005004	For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world ; and this is the victory that conquers the world , even our faith .
62005005	Who is it that is victorious over [ that conquers ] the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on that fact ] ?
62005006	This is He Who came by ( with ) water and blood [ His baptism and His death ] , Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) -- not by ( in ) the water only , but by ( in ) the water and the blood . And it is the [ Holy ] Spirit Who bears witness , because the [ Holy ] Spirit is the Truth .
62005007	So there are three witnesses in heaven : the Father , the Word and the Holy Spirit , and these three are One ;
62005008	and there are three witnesses on the earth : the Spirit , the water , and the blood ; and these three agree [ are in unison ; their testimony coincides ] .
62005009	If we accept [ as we do ] the testimony of men [ if we are willing to take human authority ] , the testimony of God is greater ( of stronger authority ) , for this is the testimony of God , even the witness which He has borne regarding His Son .
62005010	He who believes in the Son of God [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] has the testimony [ possesses this divine attestation ] within himself . He who does not believe God [ in this way ] has made Him out to be and represented Him as a liar , because he has not believed ( put his faith in , adhered to , and relied on ) the evidence ( the testimony ) that God has borne regarding His Son .
62005011	And this is that testimony ( that evidence ) : God gave us eternal life , and this life is in His Son .
62005012	He who possesses the Son has that life ; he who does not possess the Son of God does not have that life .
62005013	I write this to you who believe in ( adhere to , trust in , and rely on ) the name of the Son of God [ in the peculiar services and blessings conferred by Him on men ] , so that you may know [ with settled and absolute knowledge ] that you [ already ] have life , yes , eternal life .
62005014	And this is the confidence ( the assurance , the privilege of boldness ) which we have in Him : [ we are sure ] that if we ask anything ( make any request ) according to His will ( in agreement with His own plan ) , He listens to and hears us .
62005015	And if ( since ) we [ positively ] know that He listens to us in whatever we ask , we also know [ with settled and absolute knowledge ] that we have [ granted us as our present possessions ] the requests made of Him .
62005016	If anyone sees his brother [ believer ] committing a sin that does not [ lead to ] death ( the extinguishing of life ) , he will pray and [ God ] will give him life [ yes , He will grant life to all those whose sin is not one leading to death ] . There is a sin [ that leads ] to death ; I do not say that one should pray for that .
62005017	All wrongdoing is sin , and there is sin which does not [ involve ] death [ that may be repented of and forgiven ] .
62005018	We know [ absolutely ] that anyone born of God does not [ deliberately and knowingly ] practice committing sin , but the One Who was begotten of God carefully watches over and protects him [ Christ’s divine presence within him preserves him against the evil ] , and the wicked one does not lay hold ( get a grip ) on him or touch [ him ] .
62005019	We know [ positively ] that we are of God , and the whole world [ around us ] is under the power of the evil one .
62005020	And we [ have seen and ] know [ positively ] that the Son of God has [ actually ] come to this world and has given us understanding and insight [ progressively ] to perceive ( recognize ) and come to know better and more clearly Him Who is true ; and we are in Him Who is true -- in His Son Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . This [ Man ] is the true God and Life eternal .
62005021	Little children , keep yourselves from idols ( false gods ) -- [ from anything and everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to God , from any sort of substitute for Him that would take first place in your life ] . Amen ( so let it be ) .
63001001	THE ELDERLY elder [ of the church addresses this letter ] to the elect ( chosen ) lady ( Cyria ) and her children , whom I truly love -- and not only I but also all who are [ progressively ] learning to recognize and know and understand the Truth --
63001002	Because of the Truth which lives and stays on in our hearts and will be with us forever :
63001003	Grace ( spiritual blessing ) , mercy , and [ soul ] peace will be with us , from God the Father and from Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , the Father’s Son , in all sincerity ( truth ) and love .
63001004	I was greatly delighted to find some of your children walking ( living ) in [ the ] Truth , just as we have been commanded by the Father [ Himself ] .
63001005	And now I beg you , lady ( Cyria ) , not as if I were issuing a new charge ( injunction or command ) , but [ simply recalling to your mind ] the one we have had from the beginning , that we love one another .
63001006	And what this love consists in is this : that we live and walk in accordance with and guided by His commandments ( His orders , ordinances , precepts , teaching ) . This is the commandment , as you have heard from the beginning , that you continue to walk in love [ guided by it and following it ] .
63001007	For many imposters ( seducers , deceivers , and false leaders ) have gone out into the world , men who will not acknowledge ( confess , admit ) the coming of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) in bodily form . Such a one is the imposter ( the seducer , the deceiver , the false leader , the antagonist of Christ ) and the antichrist .
63001008	Look to yourselves ( take care ) that you may not lose ( throw away or destroy ) all that we and you have labored for , but that you may [ persevere until you ] win and receive back a perfect reward [ in full ] .
63001009	Anyone who runs on ahead [ of God ] and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ [ who is not content with what He taught ] does not have God ; but he who continues to live in the doctrine ( teaching ) of Christ [ does have God ] , he has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine [ is disloyal to what Jesus Christ taught ] , do not receive him [ do not accept him , do not welcome or admit him ] into [ your ] house or bid him Godspeed or give him any encouragement .
63001011	For he who wishes him success [ who encourages him , wishing him Godspeed ] is a partaker in his evil doings .
63001012	I have many things to write to you , but I prefer not to do so with paper and ink ; I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face , so that our joy may be complete .
63001013	The children of your elect ( chosen ) sister wish to be remembered to you . Amen ( so be it ) .
64001001	THE ELDERLY elder [ of the church addresses this letter ] to the beloved ( esteemed ) Gaius , whom I truly love .
64001002	Beloved , I pray that you may prosper in every way and [ that your body ] may keep well , even as [ I know ] your soul keeps well and prospers .
64001003	In fact , I greatly rejoiced when [ some of ] the brethren from time to time arrived and spoke [ so highly ] of the sincerity and fidelity of your life , as indeed you do live in the Truth [ the whole Gospel presents ] .
64001004	I have no greater joy than this , to hear that my [ spiritual ] children are living their lives in the Truth .
64001005	Beloved , it is a fine and faithful work that you are doing when you give any service to the [ Christian ] brethren , and [ especially when they are ] strangers .
64001006	They have testified before the church of your love and friendship . You will do well to forward them on their journey [ and you will please do so ] in a way worthy of God’s [ service ] .
64001007	For these [ traveling missionaries ] have gone out for the Name’s sake ( for His sake ) and are accepting nothing from the Gentiles ( the heathen , the non-Israelites ) .
64001008	So we ourselves ought to support such people [ to welcome and provide for them ] , in order that we may be fellow workers in the Truth ( the whole Gospel ) and cooperate with its teachers .
64001009	I have written briefly to the church ; but Diotrephes , who likes to take the lead among them and put himself first , does not acknowledge my authority and refuses to accept my suggestions or to listen to me .
64001010	So when I arrive , I will call attention to what he is doing , his boiling over and casting malicious reflections upon us with insinuating language . And not satisfied with that , he refuses to receive and welcome the [ missionary ] brethren himself , and also interferes with and forbids those who would welcome them , and tries to expel ( excommunicate ) them from the church .
64001011	Beloved , do not imitate evil , but imitate good . He who does good is of God ; he who does evil has not seen ( discerned or experienced ) God [ has enjoyed no vision of Him and does not know Him at all ] .
64001012	Demetrius has warm commendation from everyone -- and from the Truth itself ; we add our testimony also , and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I had much [ to say to you when I began ] to write , but I prefer not to put it down with pen ( a reed ) and ink ;
64001014	I hope to see you soon , and we will talk together face to face .
64001015	Peace be to you ! ( Good-bye ! ) The friends here send you greetings . Remember me to the friends there [ to every one of them personally ] by name .
65001001	JUDE , A servant of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , and brother of James , [ writes this letter ] to those who are called ( chosen ) , dearly loved by God the Father and separated ( set apart ) and kept for Jesus Christ :
65001002	May mercy , [ soul ] peace , and love be multiplied to you .
65001003	Beloved , my whole concern was to write to you in regard to our common salvation . [ But ] I found it necessary and was impelled to write you and urgently appeal to and exhort [ you ] to contend for the faith which was once for all handed down to the saints [ the faith which is that sum of Christian belief which was delivered verbally to the holy people of God ] .
65001004	For certain men have crept in stealthily [ gaining entrance secretly by a side door ] . Their doom was predicted long ago , ungodly ( impious , profane ) persons who pervert the grace ( the spiritual blessing and favor ) of our God into lawlessness and wantonness and immorality , and disown and deny our sole Master and Lord , Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
65001005	Now I want to remind you , though you were fully informed once for all , that though the Lord [ at one time ] delivered a people out of the land of Egypt , He subsequently destroyed those [ of them ] who did not believe [ who refused to adhere to , trust in , and rely upon Him ] .
65001006	And angels who did not keep ( care for , guard , and hold to ) their own first place of power but abandoned their proper dwelling place -- these He has reserved in custody in eternal chains ( bonds ) under the thick gloom of utter darkness until the judgment and doom of the great day .
65001007	[ The wicked are sentenced to suffer ] just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the adjacent towns -- which likewise gave themselves over to impurity and indulged in unnatural vice and sensual perversity -- are laid out [ in plain sight ] as an exhibit of perpetual punishment [ to warn ] of everlasting fire .
65001008	Nevertheless in like manner , these dreamers also corrupt the body , scorn and reject authority and government , and revile and libel and scoff at [ heavenly ] glories ( the glorious ones ) .
65001009	But when [ even ] the archangel Michael , contending with the devil , judicially argued ( disputed ) about the body of Moses , he dared not [ presume to ] bring an abusive condemnation against him , but [ simply ] said , The Lord rebuke you !
65001010	But these men revile ( scoff and sneer at ) anything they do not happen to be acquainted with and do not understand ; and whatever they do understand physically [ that which they know by mere instinct ] , like irrational beasts -- by these they corrupt themselves and are destroyed ( perish ) .
65001011	Woe to them ! For they have run riotously in the way of Cain , and have abandoned themselves for the sake of gain [ it offers them , following ] the error of Balaam , and have perished in rebellion [ like that ] of Korah !
65001012	These are hidden reefs ( elements of danger ) in your love feasts , where they boldly feast sumptuously [ carousing together in your midst ] , without scruples providing for themselves [ alone ] . They are clouds without water , swept along by the winds ; trees , without fruit at the late autumn gathering time -- twice ( doubly ) dead , [ lifeless and ] plucked up by the roots ;
65001013	Wild waves of the sea , flinging up the foam of their own shame and disgrace ; wandering stars , for whom the gloom of eternal darkness has been reserved forever .
65001014	It was of these people , moreover , that Enoch in the seventh [ generation ] from Adam prophesied when he said , Behold , the Lord comes with His myriads of holy ones ( ten thousands of His saints )
65001015	To execute judgment upon all and to convict all the impious ( unholy ones ) of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed [ in such an ] ungodly [ way ] , and of all the severe ( abusive , jarring ) things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him .
65001016	These are inveterate murmurers ( grumblers ) who complain [ of their lot in life ] , going after their own desires [ controlled by their passions ] ; their talk is boastful and arrogant , [ and they claim to ] admire men’s persons and pay people flattering compliments to gain advantage .
65001017	But you must remember , beloved , the predictions which were made by the apostles ( the special messengers ) of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
65001018	They told you beforehand , In the last days ( in the end time ) there will be scoffers [ who seek to gratify their own unholy desires ] , following after their own ungodly passions .
65001019	It is these who are [ agitators ] setting up distinctions and causing divisions -- merely sensual [ creatures , carnal , worldly-minded people ] , devoid of the [ Holy ] Spirit and destitute of any higher spiritual life .
65001020	But you , beloved , build yourselves up [ founded ] on your most holy faith [ make progress , rise like an edifice higher and higher ] , praying in the Holy Spirit ;
65001021	Guard and keep yourselves in the love of God ; expect and patiently wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) -- [ which will bring you ] unto life eternal .
65001022	And refute [ so as to ] convict some who dispute with you , and on some have mercy who waver and doubt .
65001023	[ Strive to ] save others , snatching [ them ] out of [ the ] fire ; on others take pity [ but ] with fear , loathing even the garment spotted by the flesh and polluted by their sensuality .
65001024	Now to Him Who is able to keep you without stumbling or slipping or falling , and to present [ you ] unblemished ( blameless and faultless ) before the presence of His glory in triumphant joy and exultation [ with unspeakable , ecstatic delight ] --
65001025	To the one only God , our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory ( splendor ) , majesty , might and dominion , and power and authority , before all time and now and forever ( unto all the ages of eternity ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
66001001	[ THIS IS ] the revelation of Jesus Christ [ His unveiling of the divine mysteries ] . God gave it to Him to disclose and make known to His bond servants certain things which must shortly and speedily come to pass in their entirety . And He sent and communicated it through His angel ( messenger ) to His bond servant John ,
66001002	Who has testified to and vouched for all that he saw [ in his visions ] , the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ .
66001003	Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) is the man who reads aloud [ in the assemblies ] the word of this prophecy ; and blessed ( happy , to be envied ) are those who hear [ it read ] and who keep themselves true to the things which are written in it [ heeding them and laying them to heart ] , for the time [ for them to be fulfilled ] is near .
66001004	John to the seven assemblies ( churches ) that are in Asia : May grace ( God’s unmerited favor ) be granted to you and spiritual peace ( the peace of Christ’s kingdom ) from Him Who is and Who was and Who is to come , and from the seven Spirits [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit ] before His throne ,
66001005	And from Jesus Christ the faithful and trustworthy Witness , the Firstborn of the dead [ first to be brought back to life ] and the Prince ( Ruler ) of the kings of the earth . To Him Who ever loves us and has once [ for all ] loosed and freed us from our sins by His own blood ,
66001006	And formed us into a kingdom ( a royal race ) , priests to His God and Father -- to Him be the glory and the power and the majesty and the dominion throughout the ages and forever and ever . Amen ( so be it ) .
66001007	Behold , He is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see Him , even those who pierced Him ; and all the tribes of the earth shall gaze upon Him and beat their breasts and mourn and lament over Him . Even so [ must it be ] . Amen ( so be it ) .
66001008	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End , says the Lord God , He Who is and Who was and Who is to come , the Almighty ( the Ruler of all ) .
66001009	I , John , your brother and companion ( sharer and participator ) with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance [ which are ] in Jesus Christ , was on the isle called Patmos , [ banished ] on account of [ my witnessing to ] the Word of God and the testimony ( the proof , the evidence ) for Jesus Christ .
66001010	I was in the Spirit [ rapt in His power ] on the Lord’s Day , and I heard behind me a great voice like the calling of a war trumpet ,
66001011	Saying , I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last . Write promptly what you see ( your vision ) in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia -- to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea .
66001012	Then I turned to see [ whose was ] the voice that was speaking to me , and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands ,
66001013	And in the midst of the lampstands [ One ] like a Son of Man , clothed with a robe which reached to His feet and with a girdle of gold about His breast .
66001014	His head and His hair were white like white wool , [ as white ] as snow , and His eyes [ flashed ] like a flame of fire .
66001015	His feet glowed like burnished ( bright ) bronze as it is refined in a furnace , and His voice was like the sound of many waters .
66001016	In His right hand He held seven stars , and from His mouth there came forth a sharp two-edged sword , and His face was like the sun shining in full power at midday .
66001017	When I saw Him , I fell at His feet as if dead . But He laid His right hand on me and said , Do not be afraid ! I am the First and the Last ,
66001018	And the Ever-living One [ I am living in the eternity of the eternities ] . I died , but see , I am alive forevermore ; and I possess the keys of death and Hades ( the realm of the dead ) .
66001019	Write therefore the things you see , what they are [ and signify ] and what is to take place hereafter .
66001020	As to the hidden meaning ( the mystery ) of the seven stars which you saw on My right hand and the seven lampstands of gold : the seven stars are the seven angels ( messengers ) of the seven assemblies ( churches ) and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .
66002001	TO THE angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Ephesus write : These are the words of Him Who holds the seven stars [ which are the messengers of the seven churches ] in His right hand , Who goes about among the seven golden lampstands [ which are the seven churches ] :
66002002	I know your industry and activities , laborious toil and trouble , and your patient endurance , and how you cannot tolerate wicked [ men ] and have tested and critically appraised those who call [ themselves ] apostles ( special messengers of Christ ) and yet are not , and have found them to be impostors and liars .
66002003	I know you are enduring patiently and are bearing up for My name’s sake , and you have not fainted or become exhausted or grown weary .
66002004	But I have this [ one charge to make ] against you : that you have left ( abandoned ) the love that you had at first [ you have deserted Me , your first love ] .
66002005	Remember then from what heights you have fallen . Repent ( change the inner man to meet God’s will ) and do the works you did previously [ when first you knew the Lord ] , or else I will visit you and remove your lampstand from its place , unless you change your mind and repent .
66002006	Yet you have this [ in your favor and to your credit ] : you hate the works of the Nicolaitans [ what they are doing as corrupters of the people ] , which I Myself also detest .
66002007	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and give heed to what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) . To him who overcomes ( is victorious ) , I will grant to eat [ of the fruit ] of the tree of life , which is in the paradise of God .
66002008	And to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Smyrna write : These are the words of the First and the Last , Who died and came to life again :
66002009	I know your affliction and distress and pressing trouble and your poverty -- but you are rich ! and how you are abused and reviled and slandered by those who say they are Jews and are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Fear nothing that you are about to suffer . [ Dismiss your dread and your fears ! ] Behold , the devil is indeed about to throw some of you into prison , that you may be tested and proved and critically appraised , and for ten days you will have affliction . Be loyally faithful unto death [ even if you must die for it ] , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) . He who overcomes ( is victorious ) shall in no way be injured by the second death .
66002012	Then to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Pergamum write : These are the words of Him Who has and wields the sharp two-edged sword :
66002013	I know where you live -- a place where Satan sits enthroned . [ Yet ] you are clinging to and holding fast My name , and you did not deny My faith , even in the days of Antipas , My witness , My faithful one , who was killed ( martyred ) in your midst -- where Satan dwells .
66002014	Nevertheless , I have a few things against you : you have some people there who are clinging to the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak to set a trap and a stumbling block before the sons of Israel , [ to entice them ] to eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and to practice lewdness [ giving themselves up to sexual vice ] .
66002015	You also have some who in a similar way are clinging to the teaching of the Nicolaitans [ those corrupters of the people ] which thing I hate .
66002016	Repent [ then ] ! Or else I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth .
66002017	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) . To him who overcomes ( conquers ) , I will give to eat of the manna that is hidden , and I will give him a white stone with a new name engraved on the stone , which no one knows or understands except he who receives it .
66002018	And to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Thyatira write : These are the words of the Son of God , Who has eyes that flash like a flame of fire , and Whose feet glow like bright and burnished and white-hot bronze :
66002019	I know your record and what you are doing , your love and faith and service and patient endurance , and that your recent works are more numerous and greater than your first ones .
66002020	But I have this against you : that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess [ claiming to be inspired ] , and who is teaching and leading astray my servants and beguiling them into practicing sexual vice and eating food sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I gave her time to repent , but she has no desire to repent of her immorality [ symbolic of idolatry ] and refuses to do so .
66002022	Take note : I will throw her on a bed [ of anguish ] , and those who commit adultery with her [ her paramours ] I will bring down to pressing distress and severe affliction , unless they turn away their minds from conduct [ such as ] hers and repent of their doings .
66002023	And I will strike her children ( her proper followers ) dead [ thoroughly exterminating them ] . And all the assemblies ( churches ) shall recognize and understand that I am He Who searches minds ( the thoughts , feelings , and purposes ) and the [ inmost ] hearts , and I will give to each of you [ the reward for what you have done ] as your work deserves .
66002024	But to the rest of you in Thyatira , who do not hold this teaching , who have not explored and known the depths of Satan , as they say -- I tell you that I do not lay upon you any other [ fresh ] burden :
66002025	Only hold fast to what you have until I come .
66002026	And he who overcomes ( is victorious ) and who obeys My commands to the [ very ] end [ doing the works that please Me ] , I will give him authority and power over the nations ;
66002027	And he shall rule them with a sceptre ( rod ) of iron , as when earthen pots are broken in pieces , and [ his power over them shall be ] like that which I Myself have received from My Father ;
66002028	And I will give him the Morning Star .
66002029	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the [ Holy ] Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) .
66003001	AND TO the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Sardis write : These are the words of Him Who has the seven Spirits of God [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit ] and the seven stars : I know your record and what you are doing ; you are supposed to be alive , but [ in reality ] you are dead .
66003002	Rouse yourselves and keep awake , and strengthen and invigorate what remains and is on the point of dying ; for I have not found a thing that you have done [ any work of yours ] meeting the requirements of My God or perfect in His sight .
66003003	So call to mind the lessons you received and heard ; continually lay them to heart and obey them , and repent . In case you will not rouse yourselves and keep awake and watch , I will come upon you like a thief , and you will not know or suspect at what hour I will come .
66003004	Yet you still have a few [ persons’ ] names in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes , and they shall walk with Me in white , because they are worthy and deserving .
66003005	Thus shall he who conquers ( is victorious ) be clad in white garments , and I will not erase or blot out his name from the Book of Life ; I will acknowledge him [ as Mine ] and I will confess his name openly before My Father and before His angels .
66003006	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the [ Holy ] Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) .
66003007	And to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Philadelphia write : These are the words of the Holy One , the True One , He Who has the key of David , Who opens and no one shall shut , Who shuts and no one shall open :
66003008	I know your [ record of ] works and what you are doing . See ! I have set before you a door wide open which no one is able to shut ; I know that you have but little power , and yet you have kept My Word and guarded My message and have not renounced or denied My name .
66003009	Take note ! I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and are not , but lie -- behold , I will make them come and bow down before your feet and learn and acknowledge that I have loved you .
66003010	Because you have guarded and kept My word of patient endurance [ have held fast the lesson of My patience with the expectant endurance that I give you ] , I also will keep you [ safe ] from the hour of trial ( testing ) which is coming on the whole world to try those who dwell upon the earth .
66003011	I am coming quickly ; hold fast what you have , so that no one may rob you and deprive you of your crown .
66003012	He who overcomes ( is victorious ) , I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God ; he shall never be put out of it or go out of it , and I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God , the new Jerusalem , which descends from My God out of heaven , and My own new name .
66003013	He who can hear , let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) .
66003014	And to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Laodicea write : These are the words of the Amen , the trusty and faithful and true Witness , the Origin and Beginning and Author of God’s creation :
66003015	I know your [ record of ] works and what you are doing ; you are neither cold nor hot . Would that you were cold or hot !
66003016	So , because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot , I will spew you out of My mouth !
66003017	For you say , I am rich ; I have prospered and grown wealthy , and I am in need of nothing ; and you do not realize and understand that you are wretched , pitiable , poor , blind , and naked .
66003018	Therefore I counsel you to purchase from Me gold refined and tested by fire , that you may be [ truly ] wealthy , and white clothes to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nudity from being seen , and salve to put on your eyes , that you may see .
66003019	Those whom I [ dearly and tenderly ] love , I tell their faults and convict and convince and reprove and chasten [ I discipline and instruct them ] . So be enthusiastic and in earnest and burning with zeal and repent [ changing your mind and attitude ] .
66003020	Behold , I stand at the door and knock ; if anyone hears and listens to and heeds My voice and opens the door , I will come in to him and will eat with him , and he [ will eat ] with Me .
66003021	He who overcomes ( is victorious ) , I will grant him to sit beside Me on My throne , as I Myself overcame ( was victorious ) and sat down beside My Father on His throne .
66003022	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the [ Holy ] Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) .
66004001	AFTER THIS I looked , and behold , a door standing open in heaven ! And the first voice which I had heard addressing me like [ the calling of ] a war trumpet said , Come up here , and I will show you what must take place in the future .
66004002	At once I came under the [ Holy ] Spirit’s power , and behold , a throne stood in heaven , with One seated on the throne !
66004003	And He Who sat there appeared like [ the crystalline brightness of ] jasper and [ the fiery ] sardius , and encircling the throne there was a halo that looked like [ a rainbow of ] emerald .
66004004	Twenty-four other thrones surrounded the throne , and seated on these thrones were twenty-four elders ( the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin ) , arrayed in white clothing , with crowns of gold upon their heads .
66004005	Out from the throne came flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder , and in front of the throne seven blazing torches burned , which are the seven Spirits of God [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit ] ;
66004006	And in front of the throne there was also what looked like a transparent glassy sea , as if of crystal . And around the throne , in the center at each side of the throne , were four living creatures ( beings ) who were full of eyes in front and behind [ with intelligence as to what is before and at the rear of them ] .
66004007	The first living creature ( being ) was like a lion , the second living creature like an ox , the third living creature had the face of a man , and the fourth living creature [ was ] like a flying eagle .
66004008	And the four living creatures , individually having six wings , were full of eyes all over and within [ underneath their wings ] ; and day and night they never stop saying , Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty ( Omnipotent ) , Who was and Who is and Who is to come .
66004009	And whenever the living creatures offer glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him Who sits on the throne , Who lives forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) ,
66004010	The twenty-four elders ( the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin ) fall prostrate before Him Who is sitting on the throne , and they worship Him Who lives forever and ever ; and they throw down their crowns before the throne , crying out ,
66004011	Worthy are You , our Lord and God , to receive the glory and the honor and dominion , for You created all things ; by Your will they were [ brought into being ] and were created .
66005001	AND I saw lying on the open hand of Him Who was seated on the throne a scroll ( book ) written within and on the back , closed and sealed with seven seals ;
66005002	And I saw a strong angel announcing in a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the scroll ? And [ who is entitled and deserves and is morally fit ] to break its seals ?
66005003	And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth [ in the realm of the dead , Hades ] was able to open the scroll or to take a [ single ] look at its contents .
66005004	And I wept audibly and bitterly because no one was found fit to open the scroll or to inspect it .
66005005	Then one of the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] said to me , Stop weeping ! See , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root ( Source ) of David , has won ( has overcome and conquered ) ! He can open the scroll and break its seven seals !
66005006	And there between the throne and the four living creatures ( beings ) and among the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] I saw a Lamb standing , as though it had been slain , with seven horns and with seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God [ the sevenfold Holy Spirit ] Who have been sent [ on duty far and wide ] into all the earth .
66005007	He then went and took the scroll from the right hand of Him Who sat on the throne .
66005008	And when He had taken the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] prostrated themselves before the Lamb . Each was holding a harp ( lute or guitar ) , and they had golden bowls full of incense ( fragrant spices and gums for burning ) , which are the prayers of God’s people ( the saints ) .
66005009	And [ now ] they sing a new song , saying , You are worthy to take the scroll and to break the seals that are on it , for You were slain ( sacrificed ) , and with Your blood You purchased men unto God from every tribe and language and people and nation .
66005010	And You have made them a kingdom ( royal race ) and priests to our God , and they shall reign [ as kings ] over the earth !
66005011	Then I looked , and I heard the voices of many angels on every side of the throne and of the living creatures and the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] , and they numbered ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands ,
66005012	Saying in a loud voice , Deserving is the Lamb , Who was sacrificed , to receive all the power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and majesty ( glory , splendor ) and blessing !
66005013	And I heard every created thing in heaven and on earth and under the earth [ in Hades , the place of departed spirits ] and on the sea and all that is in it , crying out together , To Him Who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed the blessing and the honor and the majesty ( glory , splendor ) and the power ( might and dominion ) forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) !
66005014	Then the four living creatures ( beings ) said , Amen ( so be it ) ! And the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] prostrated themselves and worshiped Him Who lives forever and ever .
66006001	THEN I saw as the Lamb broke open one of the seven seals , and as if in a voice of thunder I heard one of the four living creatures call out , Come !
66006002	And I looked , and saw there a white horse whose rider carried a bow . And a crown was given him , and he rode forth conquering and to conquer .
66006003	And when He broke the second seal , I heard the second living creature call out , Come !
66006004	And another horse came out , flaming red . And its rider was empowered to take the peace from the earth , so that men slaughtered one another ; and he was given a huge sword .
66006005	When He broke open the third seal , I heard the third living creature call out , Come and look ! And I saw , and behold , a black horse , and in his hand the rider had a pair of scales ( a balance ) .
66006006	And I heard what seemed to be a voice from the midst of the four living creatures , saying , A quart of wheat for a denarius [ a whole day’s wages ] , and three quarts of barley for a denarius ; but do not harm the oil and the wine !
66006007	When the Lamb broke open the fourth seal , I heard the fourth living creature call out , Come !
66006008	So I looked , and behold , an ashy pale horse [ black and blue as if made so by bruising ] , and its rider’s name was Death , and Hades ( the realm of the dead ) followed him closely . And they were given authority and power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with plague ( pestilence , disease ) and with wild beasts of the earth .
66006009	When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal , I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed for [ adhering to ] the Word of God and for the testimony they had borne .
66006010	They cried in a loud voice , O [ Sovereign ] Lord , holy and true , how long now before You will sit in judgment and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth ?
66006011	Then they were each given a long and flowing and festive white robe and told to rest and wait patiently a little while longer , until the number should be complete of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed as they themselves had been .
66006012	When He [ the Lamb ] broke open the sixth seal , I looked , and there was a great earthquake ; and the sun grew black as sackcloth of hair , [ the full disc of ] the moon became like blood .
66006013	And the stars of the sky dropped to the earth like a fig tree shedding its unripe fruit out of season when shaken by a strong wind .
66006014	And the sky rolled up like a scroll and vanished , and every mountain and island was dislodged from its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth and their noblemen and their magnates and their military chiefs and the wealthy and the strong and [ everyone , whether ] slave or free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains ,
66006016	And they called to the mountains and the rocks , Fall on ( before ) us and hide us from the face of Him Who sits on the throne and from the deep-seated indignation and wrath of the Lamb .
66006017	For the great day of His wrath ( vengeance , retribution , indignation ) has come , and who is able to stand before it ?
66007001	AFTER THIS I saw four angels stationed at the four corners of the earth , firmly holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow on the earth or sea or upon any tree .
66007002	Then I saw a second angel coming up from the east ( the rising of the sun ) and carrying the seal of the living God . And with a loud voice he called out to the four angels who had been given authority and power to injure earth and sea ,
66007003	Saying , Harm neither the earth nor the sea nor the trees , until we have sealed the bond servants of our God upon their foreheads .
66007004	And [ then ] I heard how many were sealed ( marked ) out of every tribe of the sons of Israel : there were 144,000 .
66007005	Twelve thousand were sealed ( marked ) out of the tribe of Judah , 12,000 of the tribe of Reuben , 12,000 of the tribe of Gad ,
66007006	Twelve thousand of the tribe of Asher , 12,000 of the tribe of Naphtali , 12,000 of the tribe of Manasseh ,
66007007	Twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon , 12,000 of the tribe of Levi , 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar ,
66007008	Twelve thousand of the tribe of Zebulun , 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph , 12,000 of the tribe of Benjamin .
66007009	After this I looked and a vast host appeared which no one could count , [ gathered out ] of every nation , from all tribes and peoples and languages . These stood before the throne and before the Lamb ; they were attired in white robes , with palm branches in their hands .
66007010	In loud voice they cried , saying , [ Our ] salvation is due to our God , Who is seated on the throne , and to the Lamb [ to Them we owe our deliverance ] !
66007011	And all the angels were standing round the throne and round the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] and the four living creatures , and they fell prostrate before the throne and worshiped God .
66007012	Amen ! ( So be it ! ) they cried . Blessing and glory and majesty and splendor and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and might [ be ascribed ] to our God to the ages and ages ( forever and ever , throughout the eternities of the eternities ) ! Amen ! ( So be it ! )
66007013	Then , addressing me , one of the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] said , Who are these [ people ] clothed in the long white robes ? And from where have they come ?
66007014	I replied , Sir , you know . And he said to me , These are they who have come out of the great tribulation ( persecution ) , and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	For this reason they are [ now ] before the [ very ] throne of God and serve Him day and night in His sanctuary ( temple ) ; and He Who is sitting upon the throne will protect and spread His tabernacle over and shelter them with His presence .
66007016	They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun smite them , nor any scorching heat .
66007017	For the Lamb Who is in the midst of the throne will be their Shepherd , and He will guide them to the springs of the waters of life ; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes .
66008001	WHEN HE [ the Lamb ] broke open the seventh seal , there was silence for about half an hour in heaven .
66008002	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and to them were given seven trumpets .
66008003	And another angel came and stood over the altar . He had a golden censer , and he was given very much incense ( fragrant spices and gums which exhale perfume when burned ) , that he might mingle it with the prayers of all the people of God ( the saints ) upon the golden altar before the throne .
66008004	And the smoke of the incense ( the perfume ) arose in the presence of God , with the prayers of the people of God ( the saints ) , from the hand of the angel .
66008005	So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and cast it upon the earth . Then there followed peals of thunder and loud rumblings and blasts and noises , and flashes of lightning and an earthquake .
66008006	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them .
66008007	The first angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and there was a storm of hail and fire mingled with blood cast upon the earth . And a third part of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees was burned up and all the green grass was burned up .
66008008	The second angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and something resembling a great mountain , blazing with fire , was hurled into the sea .
66008009	And a third of the sea was turned to blood , a third of the living creatures in the sea perished , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	The third angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and a huge star fell from heaven , burning like a torch , and it dropped on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water --
66008011	And the name of the star is Wormwood . A third part of the waters was changed into wormwood , and many people died from using the water , because it had become bitter .
66008012	Then the fourth angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and a third of the sun was smitten , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that [ the light of ] a third of them was darkened , and a third of the daylight [ itself ] was withdrawn , and likewise a third [ of the light ] of the night was kept from shining .
66008013	Then I [ looked and I ] saw a solitary eagle flying in midheaven , and as it flew I heard it crying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe to those who dwell on the earth , because of the rest of the trumpet blasts which the three angels are about to sound !
66009001	THEN THE fifth angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth ; and to the angel was given the key of the shaft of the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) .
66009002	He opened the long shaft of the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) , and smoke like the smoke of a huge furnace puffed out of the long shaft , so that the sun and the atmosphere were darkened by the smoke from the long shaft .
66009003	Then out of the smoke locusts came forth on the earth , and such power was granted them as the power the earth’s scorpions have .
66009004	They were told not to injure the herbage of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree , but only [ to attack ] such human beings as do not have the seal ( mark ) of God on their foreheads .
66009005	They were not permitted to kill them , but to torment ( distress , vex ) them for five months ; and the pain caused them was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a person .
66009006	And in those days people will seek death and will not find it ; and they will yearn to die , but death evades and flees from them .
66009007	The locusts resembled horses equipped for battle . On their heads was something like golden crowns . Their faces resembled the faces of people .
66009008	They had hair like the hair of women , and their teeth were like lions’ teeth .
66009009	Their breastplates ( scales ) resembled breastplates made of iron , and the [ whirring ] noise made by their wings was like the roar of a vast number of horse-drawn chariots going at full speed into battle .
66009010	They have tails like scorpions , and they have stings , and in their tails lies their ability to hurt men for [ the ] five months .
66009011	Over them as king they have the angel of the Abyss ( of the bottomless pit ) . In Hebrew his name is Abaddon [ destruction ] , but in Greek he is called Apollyon [ destroyer ] .
66009012	The first woe ( calamity ) has passed ; behold , two others are yet to follow .
66009013	Then the sixth angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and from the four horns of the golden altar which stands before God I heard a solitary voice ,
66009014	Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , Liberate the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates .
66009015	So the four angels who had been in readiness for that hour in the appointed day , month , and year were liberated to destroy a third of mankind .
66009016	The number of their troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand ( 200,000,000 ) ; I heard what their number was .
66009017	And in [ my ] vision the horses and their riders appeared to me like this : the riders wore breastplates the color of fiery red and sapphire blue and sulphur ( brimstone ) yellow . The heads of the horses looked like lions’ heads , and from their mouths there poured fire and smoke and sulphur ( brimstone ) .
66009018	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues -- by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur ( brimstone ) that poured from the mouths of the horses .
66009019	For the power of the horses to do harm is in their mouths and also in their tails . Their tails are like serpents , for they have heads , and it is by means of them that they wound people .
66009020	And the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues even then did not repent of [ the worship of ] the works of their [ own ] hands , so as to cease paying homage to the demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor move .
66009021	And they did not repent of their murders or their practice of magic ( sorceries ) or their sexual vice or their thefts .
66010001	THEN I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven , robed in a cloud , with a [ halo like a ] rainbow over his head ; his face was like the sun , and his feet ( legs ) were like columns of fire .
66010002	He had a little book ( scroll ) open in his hand . He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
66010003	And he shouted with a loud voice like the roaring of a lion ; and when he had shouted , the seven thunders gave voice and uttered their message in distinct words .
66010004	And when the seven thunders had spoken ( sounded ) , I was going to write [ it down ] , but I heard a voice from heaven saying , Seal up what the seven thunders have said ! Do not write it down !
66010005	Then the [ mighty ] angel whom I had seen stationed on sea and land raised his right hand to heaven ( the sky ) ,
66010006	And swore in the name of ( by ) Him Who lives forever and ever , Who created the heavens ( sky ) and all they contain , and the earth and all that it contains , and the sea and all that it contains . [ He swore ] that no more time should intervene and there should be no more waiting or delay ,
66010007	But that when the days come when the trumpet call of the seventh angel is about to be sounded , then God’s mystery ( His secret design , His hidden purpose ) , as He had announced the glad tidings to His servants the prophets , should be fulfilled ( accomplished , completed ) .
66010008	Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke again to me , saying , Go and take the little book ( scroll ) which is open on the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land .
66010009	So I went up to the angel and asked him to give me the little book . And he said to me , Take it and eat it . It will embitter your stomach , though in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey .
66010010	So I took the little book from the angel’s hand and ate and swallowed it ; it was as sweet as honey in my mouth , but once I had swallowed it , my stomach was embittered .
66010011	Then they said to me , You are to make a fresh prophecy concerning many peoples and races and nations and languages and kings .
66011001	A REED [ as a measuring rod ] was then given to me , [ shaped ] like a staff , and I was told : Rise up and measure the sanctuary of God and the altar [ of incense ] , and [ number ] those who worship there .
66011002	But leave out of your measuring the court outside the sanctuary of God ; omit that , for it is given over to the Gentiles ( the nations ) , and they will trample the holy city underfoot for 42 months ( three and one-half years ) .
66011003	And I will grant the power of prophecy to My two witnesses for 1,260 ( 42 months ; three and one-half years ) , dressed in sackcloth .
66011004	These [ witnesses ] are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	And if anyone attempts to injure them , fire pours from their mouth and consumes their enemies ; if anyone should attempt to harm them , thus he is doomed to be slain .
66011006	These [ two witnesses ] have power to shut up the sky , so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying ( their prediction of events relating to Christ’s kingdom and its speedy triumph ) ; and they also have power to turn the waters into blood and to smite and scourge the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they choose .
66011007	But when they have finished their testimony and their evidence is all in , the beast ( monster ) that comes up out of the Abyss ( bottomless pit ) will wage war on them , and conquer them and kill them .
66011008	And their dead bodies [ will lie exposed ] in the open street ( a public square ) of the great city which is in a spiritual sense called [ by the mystical and allegorical names of ] Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	For three and a half days men from the races and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be put in a tomb .
66011010	And those who dwell on the earth will gloat and exult over them and rejoice exceedingly , taking their ease and sending presents [ in congratulation ] to one another , because these two prophets had been such a vexation and trouble and torment to all the dwellers on the earth .
66011011	But after three and a half days , by God’s gift the breath of life again entered into them , and they rose up on their feet , and great dread and terror fell on those who watched them .
66011012	Then [ the two witnesses ] heard a strong voice from heaven calling to them , Come up here ! And before the very eyes of their enemies they ascended into heaven in a cloud .
66011013	And at that [ very ] hour there was a tremendous earthquake and one tenth of the city was destroyed ( fell ) ; seven thousand people perished in the earthquake , and those who remained were filled with dread and terror and were awe-struck , and they glorified the God of heaven .
66011014	The second woe ( calamity ) has passed ; now the third woe is speedily to come .
66011015	The seventh angel then blew [ his ] trumpet , and there were mighty voices in heaven , shouting , The dominion ( kingdom , sovereignty , rule ) of the world has now come into the possession and become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ ( the Messiah ) , and He shall reign forever and ever ( for the eternities of the eternities ) !
66011016	Then the twenty-four elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] , who sit on their thrones before God , prostrated themselves before Him and worshiped ,
66011017	Exclaiming , To You we give thanks , Lord God Omnipotent , [ the One ] Who is and [ ever ] was , for assuming the high sovereignty and the great power that are Yours and for beginning to reign .
66011018	And the heathen ( the nations ) raged , but Your wrath ( retribution , indignation ) came , the time when the dead will be judged and Your servants the prophets and saints rewarded -- and those who revere ( fear ) Your name , both low and high and small and great -- and [ the time ] for destroying the corrupters of the earth .
66011019	Then the sanctuary of God in heaven was thrown open , and the ark of His covenant was seen standing inside in His sanctuary ; and there were flashes of lightning , loud rumblings ( blasts , mutterings ) , peals of thunder , an earthquake , and a terrific hailstorm .
66012001	AND A great sign ( wonder ) -- [ warning of future events of ominous significance ] appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , with the moon under her feet , and with a crownlike garland ( tiara ) of twelve stars on her head .
66012002	She was pregnant and she cried out in her birth pangs , in the anguish of her delivery .
66012003	Then another ominous sign ( wonder ) was seen in heaven : Behold , a huge , fiery-red dragon , with seven heads and ten horns , and seven kingly crowns ( diadems ) upon his heads .
66012004	His tail swept [ across the sky ] and dragged down a third of the stars and flung them to the earth . And the dragon stationed himself in front of the woman who was about to be delivered , so that he might devour her child as soon as she brought it forth .
66012005	And she brought forth a male Child , One Who is destined to shepherd ( rule ) all the nations with an iron staff ( scepter ) , and her Child was caught up to God and to His throne .
66012006	And the woman [ herself ] fled into the desert ( wilderness ) , where she has a retreat prepared [ for her ] by God , in which she is to be fed and kept safe for 1,260 days ( 42 months ; three and one-half years ) .
66012007	Then war broke out in heaven ; Michael and his angels went forth to battle with the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought .
66012008	But they were defeated , and there was no room found for them in heaven any longer .
66012009	And the huge dragon was cast down and out -- that age-old serpent , who is called the Devil and Satan , he who is the seducer ( deceiver ) of all humanity the world over ; he was forced out and down to the earth , and his angels were flung out along with him .
66012010	Then I heard a strong ( loud ) voice in heaven , saying , Now it has come -- the salvation and the power and the kingdom ( the dominion , the reign ) of our God , and the power ( the sovereignty , the authority ) of His Christ ( the Messiah ) ; for the accuser of our brethren , he who keeps bringing before our God charges against them day and night , has been cast out !
66012011	And they have overcome ( conquered ) him by means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony , for they did not love and cling to life even when faced with death [ holding their lives cheap till they had to die for their witnessing ] .
66012012	Therefore be glad ( exult ) , O heavens and you that dwell in them ! But woe to you , O earth and sea , for the devil has come down to you in fierce anger ( fury ) , because he knows that he has [ only ] a short time [ left ] !
66012013	And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth , he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male Child .
66012014	But the woman was supplied with the two wings of a giant eagle , so that she might fly from the presence of the serpent into the desert ( wilderness ) , to the retreat where she is to be kept safe and fed for a time , and times , and half a time ( three and one-half years , or 1,260 days ) .
66012015	Then out of his mouth the serpent spouted forth water like a flood after the woman , that she might be carried off with the torrent .
66012016	But the earth came to the rescue of the woman , and the ground opened its mouth and swallowed up the stream of water which the dragon had spouted from his mouth .
66012017	So then the dragon was furious ( enraged ) at the woman , and he went away to wage war on the remainder of her descendants -- [ on those ] who obey God’s commandments and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ [ and adhere to it and bear witness to Him ] .
66013001	[ AS ] I stood on the sandy beach , I saw a beast coming up out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads . On his horns he had ten royal crowns ( diadems ) and blasphemous titles ( names ) on his heads .
66013002	And the beast that I saw resembled a leopard , but his feet were like those of a bear and his mouth was like that of a lion . And to him the dragon gave his [ own ] might and power and his [ own ] throne and great dominion .
66013003	And one of his heads seemed to have a deadly wound . But his death stroke was healed ; and the whole earth went after the beast in amazement and admiration .
66013004	They fell down and paid homage to the dragon , because he had bestowed on the beast all his dominion and authority ; they also praised and worshiped the beast , exclaiming , Who is a match for the beast , and , Who can make war against him ?
66013005	And the beast was given the power of speech , uttering boastful and blasphemous words , and he was given freedom to exert his authority and to exercise his will during forty-two months ( three and a half years ) .
66013006	And he opened his mouth to speak slanders against God , blaspheming His name and His abode , [ even vilifying ] those who live in heaven .
66013007	He was further permitted to wage war on God’s holy people ( the saints ) and to overcome them . And power was given him to extend his authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation ,
66013008	And all the inhabitants of the earth will fall down in adoration and pay him homage , everyone whose name has not been recorded in the Book of Life of the Lamb that was slain [ in sacrifice ] from the foundation of the world .
66013009	If anyone is able to hear , let him listen :
66013010	Whoever leads into captivity will himself go into captivity ; if anyone slays with the sword , with the sword must he be slain . Herein is [ the call for ] the patience and the faith and fidelity of the saints ( God’s people ) .
66013011	Then I saw another beast rising up out of the land [ itself ] ; he had two horns like a lamb , and he spoke ( roared ) like a dragon .
66013012	He exerts all the power and right of control of the former beast in his presence , and causes the earth and those who dwell upon it to exalt and deify the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed , and to worship him .
66013013	He performs great signs ( startling miracles ) , even making fire fall from the sky to the earth in men’s sight .
66013014	And because of the signs ( miracles ) which he is allowed to perform in the presence of the [ first ] beast , he deceives those who inhabit the earth , commanding them to erect a statue ( an image ) in the likeness of the beast who was wounded by the [ small ] sword and still lived .
66013015	And he is permitted [ also ] to impart the breath of life into the beast’s image , so that the statue of the beast could actually talk and cause to be put to death those who would not bow down and worship the image of the beast .
66013016	Also he compels all [ alike ] , both small and great , both the rich and the poor , both free and slave , to be marked with an inscription [ stamped ] on their right hands or on their foreheads ,
66013017	So that no one will have power to buy or sell unless he bears the stamp ( mark , inscription ) , [ that is ] the name of the beast or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is [ room for ] discernment [ a call for the wisdom of interpretation ] . Let anyone who has intelligence ( penetration and insight enough ) calculate the number of the beast , for it is a human number [ the number of a certain man ] ; his number is 666 .
66014001	THEN I looked , and behold , the Lamb stood on Mount Zion , and with Him 144,000 [ men ] who had His name and His Father’s name inscribed on their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of great waters and like the rumbling of mighty thunder ; the voice I heard [ seemed like the music ] of harpists accompanying themselves on their harps .
66014003	And they sang a new song before the throne [ of God ] and before the four living creatures and before the elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] . No one could learn [ to sing ] that song except the 144,000 who had been ransomed ( purchased , redeemed ) from the earth .
66014004	These are they who have not defiled themselves by relations with women , for they are [ pure as ] virgins . These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He goes . These are they who have been ransomed ( purchased , redeemed ) from among men as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb .
66014005	No lie was found to be upon their lips , for they are blameless ( spotless , untainted , without blemish ) before the throne of God .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying in midair , with an eternal Gospel ( good news ) to tell to the inhabitants of the earth , to every race and tribe and language and people .
66014007	And he cried with a mighty voice , Revere God and give Him glory ( honor and praise in worship ) , for the hour of His judgment has arrived . Fall down before Him ; pay Him homage and adoration and worship Him Who created heaven and earth , the sea and the springs ( fountains ) of water .
66014008	Then another angel , a second , followed , declaring , Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She who made all nations drink of the [ maddening ] wine of her passionate unchastity [ idolatry ] .
66014009	Then another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a mighty voice , Whoever pays homage to the beast and his statue and permits the [ beast’s ] stamp ( mark , inscription ) to be put on his forehead or on his hand ,
66014010	He too shall [ have to ] drink of the wine of God’s indignation and wrath , poured undiluted into the cup of His anger ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb .
66014011	And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever ; and they have no respite ( no pause , no intermission , no rest , no peace ) day or night -- these who pay homage to the beast and to his image and whoever receives the stamp of his name upon him .
66014012	Here [ comes in a call for ] the steadfastness of the saints [ the patience , the endurance of the people of God ] , those who [ habitually ] keep God’s commandments and [ their ] faith in Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard further [ perceiving the distinct words of ] a voice from heaven , saying , Write this : Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) are the dead from now on who die in the Lord ! Yes , blessed ( happy , to be envied indeed ) , says the Spirit , [ in ] that they may rest from their labors , for their works ( deeds ) do follow ( attend , accompany ) them !
66014014	Again I looked , and behold , [ I saw ] a white cloud , and sitting on the cloud One resembling a Son of Man , with a crown of gold on His head and a sharp scythe ( sickle ) in His hand .
66014015	And another angel came out of the temple sanctuary , calling with a mighty voice to Him Who was sitting upon the cloud , Put in Your scythe and reap , for the hour has arrived to gather the harvest , for the earth’s crop is fully ripened .
66014016	So He Who was sitting upon the cloud swung His scythe ( sickle ) on the earth , and the earth’s crop was harvested .
66014017	Then another angel came out of the temple [ sanctuary ] in heaven , and he also carried a sharp scythe ( sickle ) .
66014018	And another angel came forth from the altar , [ the angel ] who has authority and power over fire , and he called with a loud cry to him who had the sharp scythe ( sickle ) , Put forth your scythe and reap the fruitage of the vine of the earth , for its grapes are entirely ripe .
66014019	So the angel swung his scythe on the earth and stripped the grapes and gathered the vintage from the vines of the earth and cast it into the huge winepress of God’s indignation and wrath .
66014020	And [ the grapes in ] the winepress were trodden outside the city , and blood poured from the winepress , [ reaching ] as high as horses’ bridles , for a distance of 1,600 stadia ( about 200 miles ) .
66015001	THEN I saw another wonder ( sign , token , symbol ) in heaven , great and marvelous [ warning of events of ominous significance ] : There were seven angels bringing seven plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) , which are the last , for with them God’s wrath ( indignation ) is completely expressed [ reaches its climax and is ended ] .
66015002	Then I saw what seemed to be a glassy sea blended with fire , and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his statue and from the number corresponding to his name were standing beside the glassy sea , with harps of God in their hands .
66015003	And they sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb , saying , Mighty and marvelous are Your works , O Lord God the Omnipotent ! Righteous ( just ) and true are Your ways , O Sovereign of the ages ( King of the nations ) !
66015004	Who shall not reverence and glorify Your name , O Lord [ giving You honor and praise in worship ] ? For You only are holy . All the nations shall come and pay homage and adoration to You , for Your just judgments ( Your righteous sentences and deeds ) have been made known and displayed .
66015005	After this I looked and the sanctuary of the tent of the testimony in heaven was thrown open ,
66015006	And there came out of the temple sanctuary the seven angels bringing the seven plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) . They were arrayed in pure gleaming linen , and around their breasts they wore golden girdles .
66015007	And one of the four living creatures [ then ] gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath and indignation of God , Who lives forever and ever ( in the eternities of the eternities ) .
66015008	And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory ( the radiance , the splendor ) of God and from His might and power , and no one was able to go into the sanctuary until the seven plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) of the seven angels were ended .
66016001	THEN I heard a mighty voice from the temple sanctuary saying to the seven angels , Go and empty out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s wrath and indignation .
66016002	So the first [ angel ] went and emptied his bowl on the earth , and foul and painful ulcers ( sores ) came on the people who were marked with the stamp of the beast and who did homage to his image .
66016003	The second [ angel ] emptied his bowl into the sea , and it turned into blood like that of a corpse [ thick , corrupt , ill-smelling , and disgusting ] , and every living thing that was in the sea perished .
66016004	Then the third [ angel ] emptied out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water , and they turned into ( became ) blood .
66016005	And I also heard the angel of the waters say , Righteous ( just ) are You in these Your decisions and judgments , You Who are and were , O Holy One !
66016006	Because they have poured out the blood of Your people ( the saints ) and the prophets , and You have given them blood to drink . Such is their due [ they deserve it ] !
66016007	And [ from ] the altar I heard [ the ] cry , Yes , Lord God the Omnipotent , Your judgments ( sentences , decisions ) are true and just and righteous !
66016008	Then the fourth [ angel ] emptied out his bowl upon the sun , and it was permitted to burn ( scorch ) humanity with [ fierce , glowing ] heat ( fire ) .
66016009	People were severely burned ( scorched ) by the fiery heat , and they reviled and blasphemed the name of God , Who has control of these plagues , and they did not repent of their sins [ felt no regret , contrition , and compunction for their waywardness , refusing to amend their ways ] to give Him glory .
66016010	Then the fifth [ angel ] emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was [ plunged ] in darkness ; and people gnawed their tongues for the torment [ of their excruciating distress and severe pain ]
66016011	And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their anguish and their ulcers ( sores ) , and they did not deplore their wicked deeds or repent [ for what they had done ] .
66016012	Then the sixth [ angel ] emptied his bowl on the mighty river Euphrates , and its water was dried up to make ready a road for [ the coming of ] the kings of the east ( from the rising sun ) .
66016013	And I saw three loathsome spirits like frogs , [ leaping ] from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet .
66016014	For really they are the spirits of demons that perform signs ( wonders , miracles ) . And they go forth to the rulers and leaders all over the world , to gather them together for war on the great day of God the Almighty .
66016015	Behold , I am going to come like a thief ! Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) is he who stays awake ( alert ) and who guards his clothes , so that he may not be naked and [ have the shame of being ] seen exposed !
66016016	And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon .
66016017	Then the seventh [ angel ] emptied out his bowl into the air , and a mighty voice came out of the sanctuary of heaven from the throne [ of God ] , saying , It is done ! [ It is all over , it is all accomplished , it has come ! ]
66016018	And there followed lightning flashes , loud rumblings , peals of thunder , and a tremendous earthquake ; nothing like it has ever occurred since men dwelt on the earth , so severe and far-reaching was that earthquake .
66016019	The mighty city was broken into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . And God kept in mind mighty Babylon , to make her drain the cup of His furious wrath and indignation .
66016020	And every island fled and no mountains could be found .
66016021	And great ( excessively oppressive ) hailstones , as heavy as a talent [ between fifty and sixty pounds ] , of immense size , fell from the sky on the people ; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail , so very great was [ the torture ] of that plague .
66017001	ONE OF the seven angels who had the seven bowls then came and spoke to me , saying , Come with me ! I will show you the doom ( sentence , judgment ) of the great harlot ( idolatress ) who is seated on many waters ,
66017002	[ She ] with whom the rulers of the earth have joined in prostitution ( idolatry ) and with the wine of whose immorality ( idolatry ) the inhabitants of the earth have become intoxicated .
66017003	And [ the angel ] bore me away [ rapt ] in the Spirit into a desert ( wilderness ) , and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was all covered with blasphemous titles ( names ) , and he had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and bedecked with gold , precious stones , and pearls , [ and she was ] holding in her hand a golden cup full of the accursed offenses and the filth of her lewdness and vice .
66017005	And on her forehead there was inscribed a name of mystery [ with a secret symbolic meaning ] : Babylon the great , the mother of prostitutes ( idolatresses ) and of the filth and atrocities and abominations of the earth .
66017006	I also saw that the woman was drunk , [ drunk ] with the blood of the saints ( God’s people ) and the blood of the martyrs [ who witnessed ] for Jesus . And when I saw her , I was utterly amazed and wondered greatly .
66017007	But the angel said to me , Why do you wonder ? I will explain to you the [ secret symbolic meaning of the ] mystery of the woman , as well as of the beast having the seven heads and ten horns that carries her .
66017008	The beast that you saw [ once ] was , but [ now ] is no more , and he is going to come up out of the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) and proceed to go to perdition . And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been recorded in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they look at the beast , because he [ once ] was , but [ now ] is no more , and he is [ yet ] to come .
66017009	This calls for a mind [ to consider that is packed ] with wisdom and intelligence [ it is something for a particular mode of thinking and judging of thoughts , feelings , and purposes ] . The seven heads are seven hills upon which the woman is sitting ;
66017010	And they are also seven kings , five of whom have fallen , one still exists [ and is reigning ] ; the other [ the seventh ] has not yet appeared , and when he does arrive , he must stay [ but ] a brief time .
66017011	And as for the beast that [ once ] was , but now is no more , he [ himself ] is an eighth ruler ( king , head ) , but he is of the seven and belongs to them , and he goes to perdition .
66017012	Also the ten horns that you observed are ten rulers ( kings ) who have as yet received no royal dominion , but together they are to receive power and authority as rulers for a single hour , along with the beast .
66017013	These have one common policy ( opinion , purpose ) , and they deliver their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will wage war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will triumph over them ; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings -- and those with Him and on His side are chosen and called [ elected ] and loyal and faithful followers .
66017015	And [ the angel further ] said to me , The waters that you observed , where the harlot is seated , are races and multitudes and nations and dialects ( languages ) .
66017016	And the ten horns that you saw , they and the beast will [ be the very ones to ] hate the harlot ( the idolatrous woman ) ; they will make her cheerless ( bereaved , desolate ) , and they will strip her and eat up her flesh and utterly consume her with fire .
66017017	For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His own purpose by acting in harmony in surrendering their royal power and authority to the beast , until the prophetic words ( intentions and promises ) of God shall be fulfilled .
66017018	And the woman that you saw is herself the great city which dominates and controls the rulers and the leaders of the earth .
66018001	THEN I saw another angel descending from heaven , possessing great authority , and the earth was illuminated with his radiance and splendor .
66018002	And he shouted with a mighty voice , She is fallen ! Mighty Babylon is fallen ! She has become a resort and dwelling place for demons , a dungeon haunted by every loathsome spirit , an abode for every filthy and detestable bird .
66018003	For all nations have drunk the wine of her passionate unchastity , and the rulers and leaders of the earth have joined with her in committing fornication ( idolatry ) , and the businessmen of the earth have become rich with the wealth of her excessive luxury and wantonness .
66018004	I then heard another voice from heaven saying , Come out from her , my people , so that you may not share in her sins , neither participate in her plagues .
66018005	For her iniquities ( her crimes and transgressions ) are piled up as high as heaven , and God has remembered her wickedness and [ her ] crimes [ and calls them up for settlement ] .
66018006	Repay to her what she herself has paid [ to others ] and double [ her doom ] in accordance with what she has done . Mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed [ for others ] .
66018007	To the degree that she glorified herself and reveled in her wantonness [ living deliciously and luxuriously ] , to that measure impose on her torment and anguish and tears and mourning . Since in her heart she boasts , I am not a widow ; as a queen [ on a throne ] I sit , and I shall never see suffering or experience sorrow --
66018008	So shall her plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) come thick upon her in a single day , pestilence and anguish and sorrow and famine ; and she shall be utterly consumed ( burned up with fire ) , for mighty is the Lord God Who judges her .
66018009	And the rulers and leaders of the earth who joined her in her immorality ( idolatry ) and luxuriated with her will weep and beat their breasts and lament over her when they see the smoke of her conflagration .
66018010	They will stand a long way off , in terror of her torment , and they will cry , Woe and alas , the great city , the mighty city , Babylon ! In one single hour how your doom ( judgment ) has overtaken you !
66018011	And earth’s businessmen will weep and grieve over her because no one buys their freight ( cargo ) any more .
66018012	Their merchandise is of gold , silver , precious stones , and pearls ; of fine linen , purple , silk , and scarlet [ stuffs ] ; all kinds of scented wood , all sorts of articles of ivory , all varieties of objects of costly woods , bronze , iron , and marble ;
66018013	Of cinnamon , spices , incense , ointment and perfume , and frankincense , of wine and olive oil , fine flour and wheat ; of cattle and sheep , horses and conveyances ; and of slaves ( the bodies ) and souls of men !
66018014	The ripe fruits and delicacies for which your soul longed have gone from you , and all your luxuries and dainties , your elegance and splendor are lost to you , never again to be recovered or experienced !
66018015	The dealers who handled these articles , who grew wealthy through their business with her , will stand a long way off , in terror of her doom and torment , weeping and grieving aloud , and saying ,
66018016	Alas , alas for the great city that was robed in fine linen , in purple and scarlet , bedecked and glittering with gold , with precious stones , and with pearls !
66018017	Because in one [ single ] hour all the vast wealth has been destroyed ( wiped out ) . And all ship captains and pilots , navigators and all who live by seafaring , the crews and all who ply their trade on the sea , stood a long way off ,
66018018	And exclaimed as they watched the smoke of her burning , What city could be compared to the great city !
66018019	And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and grieved , exclaiming , Woe and alas , for the great city , where all who had ships on the sea grew rich [ through her extravagance ] from her great wealth ! In one single hour she has been destroyed and has become a desert !
66018020	Rejoice ( celebrate ) over her , O heaven ! O saints ( people of God ) and apostles and prophets , because God has executed vengeance for you upon her !
66018021	Then a single powerful angel took up a boulder like a great millstone and flung it into the sea , crying , With such violence shall Babylon the great city be hurled down to destruction and shall never again be found .
66018022	And the sound of harpists and minstrels and flute players and trumpeters shall never again be heard in you , and no skilled artisan of any craft shall ever again be found in you , and the sound of the millstone shall never again be heard in you .
66018023	And never again shall the light of a lamp shine in you , and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again ; for your businessmen were the great and prominent men of the earth , and by your magic spells and poisonous charm all nations were led astray ( seduced and deluded ) .
66018024	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all those who have been slain ( slaughtered ) on earth .
66019001	AFTER THIS I heard what sounded like a mighty shout of a great crowd in heaven , exclaiming , Hallelujah ( praise the Lord ) ! Salvation and glory ( splendor and majesty ) and power ( dominion and authority ) [ belong ] to our God !
66019002	Because His judgments ( His condemnation and punishment , His sentences of doom ) are true and sound and just and upright . He has judged ( convicted , pronounced sentence , and doomed ) the great and notorious harlot ( idolatress ) who corrupted and demoralized and poisoned the earth with her lewdness and adultery ( idolatry ) . And He has avenged ( visited on her the penalty for ) the blood of His servants at her hand .
66019003	And again they shouted , Hallelujah ( praise the Lord ) ! The smoke of her [ burning ] shall continue to ascend forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) .
66019004	Then the twenty-four elders [ of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] and the four living creatures fell prostrate and worshiped [ paying divine honors to ] God , Who sits on the throne , saying , Amen ! Hallelujah ( praise the Lord ) !
66019005	Then from the throne there came a voice , saying , Praise our God , all you servants of His , you who reverence Him , both small and great !
66019006	After that I heard what sounded like the shout of a vast throng , like the boom of many pounding waves , and like the roar of terrific and mighty peals of thunder , exclaiming , Hallelujah ( praise the Lord ) ! For now the Lord our God the Omnipotent ( the All-Ruler ) reigns !
66019007	Let us rejoice and shout for joy [ exulting and triumphant ] ! Let us celebrate and ascribe to Him glory and honor , for the marriage of the Lamb [ at last ] has come , and His bride has prepared herself .
66019008	She has been permitted to dress in fine ( radiant ) linen , dazzling and white -- for the fine linen is ( signifies , represents ) the righteousness ( the upright , just , and godly living , deeds , and conduct , and right standing with God ) of the saints ( God’s holy people ) .
66019009	Then [ the angel ] said to me , Write this down : Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) are those who are summoned ( invited , called ) to the marriage supper of the Lamb . And he said to me [ further ] , These are the true words ( the genuine and exact declarations ) of God .
66019010	Then I fell prostrate at his feet to worship ( to pay divine honors ) to him , but he [ restrained me ] and said , Refrain ! [ You must not do that ! ] I am [ only ] another servant with you and your brethren who have [ accepted and hold ] the testimony borne by Jesus . Worship God ! For the substance ( essence ) of the truth revealed by Jesus is the spirit of all prophecy [ the vital breath , the inspiration of all inspired preaching and interpretation of the divine will and purpose , including both mine and yours ] .
66019011	After that I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse [ appeared ] ! The One Who was riding it is called Faithful ( Trustworthy , Loyal , Incorruptible , Steady ) and True , and He passes judgment and wages war in righteousness ( holiness , justice , and uprightness ) .
66019012	His eyes [ blaze ] like a flame of fire , and on His head are many kingly crowns ( diadems ) ; and He has a title ( name ) inscribed which He alone knows or can understand .
66019013	He is dressed in a robe dyed by dipping in blood , and the title by which He is called is The Word of God .
66019014	And the troops of heaven , clothed in fine linen , dazzling and clean , followed Him on white horses .
66019015	From His mouth goes forth a sharp sword with which He can smite ( afflict , strike ) the nations ; and He will shepherd and control them with a staff ( scepter , rod ) of iron . He will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath and indignation of God the All-Ruler ( the Almighty , the Omnipotent ) .
66019016	And on His garment ( robe ) and on His thigh He has a name ( title ) inscribed , king of kings and lord of lords .
66019017	Then I saw a single angel stationed in the sun’s light , and with a mighty voice he shouted to all the birds that fly across the sky , Come , gather yourselves together for the great supper of God ,
66019018	That you may feast on the flesh of rulers , the flesh of generals and captains , the flesh of powerful and mighty men , the flesh of horses and their riders , and the flesh of all humanity , both free and slave , both small and great !
66019019	Then I saw the beast and the rulers and leaders of the earth with their troops mustered to go into battle and make war against Him Who is mounted on the horse and against His troops .
66019020	And the beast was seized and overpowered , and with him the false prophet who in his presence had worked wonders and performed miracles by which he led astray those who had accepted or permitted to be placed upon them the stamp ( mark ) of the beast and those who paid homage and gave divine honors to his statue . Both of them were hurled alive into the fiery lake that burns and blazes with brimstone .
66019021	And the rest were killed with the sword that issues from the mouth of Him Who is mounted on the horse , and all the birds fed ravenously and glutted themselves with their flesh .
66020001	THEN I saw an angel descending from heaven ; he was holding the key of the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) and a great chain was in his hand .
66020002	And he gripped and overpowered the dragon , that old serpent [ of primeval times ] , who is the devil and Satan , and [ securely ] bound him for a thousand years .
66020003	Then he hurled him into the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) and closed it and sealed it above him , so that he should no longer lead astray and deceive and seduce the nations until the thousand years were at an end . After that he must be liberated for a short time .
66020004	Then I saw thrones , and sitting on them were those to whom authority to act as judges and to pass sentence was entrusted . Also I saw the souls of those who had been slain with axes [ beheaded ] for their witnessing to Jesus and [ for preaching and testifying ] for the Word of God , and who had refused to pay homage to the beast or his statue and had not accepted his mark or permitted it to be stamped on their foreheads or on their hands . And they lived again and ruled with Christ ( the Messiah ) a thousand years .
66020005	The remainder of the dead were not restored to life again until the thousand years were completed . This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed ( happy , to be envied ) and holy ( spiritually whole , of unimpaired innocence and proved virtue ) is the person who takes part ( shares ) in the first resurrection ! Over them the second death exerts no power or authority , but they shall be ministers of God and of Christ ( the Messiah ) , and they shall rule along with Him a thousand years .
66020007	And when the thousand years are completed , Satan will be released from his place of confinement ,
66020008	And he will go forth to deceive and seduce and lead astray the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- to muster them for war ; their number is like the sand of the sea .
66020009	And they swarmed up over the broad plain of the earth and encircled the fortress ( camp ) of God’s people ( the saints ) and the beloved city ; but fire descended from heaven and consumed them .
66020010	Then the devil who had led them astray [ deceiving and seducing them ] was hurled into the fiery lake of burning brimstone , where the beast and false prophet were ; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever ( through the ages of the ages ) .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne and the One Who was seated upon it , from Whose presence and from the sight of Whose face earth and sky fled away , and no place was found for them .
66020012	I [ also ] saw the dead , great and small ; they stood before the throne , and books were opened . Then another book was opened , which is [ the Book ] of Life . And the dead were judged ( sentenced ) by what they had done [ their whole way of feeling and acting , their aims and endeavors ] in accordance with what was recorded in the books .
66020013	And the sea delivered up the dead who were in it , death and Hades ( the state of death or disembodied existence ) surrendered the dead in them , and all were tried and their cases determined by what they had done [ according to their motives , aims , and works ] .
66020014	Then death and Hades ( the state of death or disembodied existence ) were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death , the lake of fire .
66020015	And if anyone’s [ name ] was not found recorded in the Book of Life , he was hurled into the lake of fire .
66021001	THEN I saw a new sky ( heaven ) and a new earth , for the former sky and the former earth had passed away ( vanished ) , and there no longer existed any sea .
66021002	And I saw the holy city , the new Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God , all arrayed like a bride beautified and adorned for her husband ;
66021003	Then I heard a mighty voice from the throne and I perceived its distinct words , saying , See ! The abode of God is with men , and He will live ( encamp , tent ) among them ; and they shall be His people , and God shall personally be with them and be their God .
66021004	God will wipe away every tear from their eyes ; and death shall be no more , neither shall there be anguish ( sorrow and mourning ) nor grief nor pain any more , for the old conditions and the former order of things have passed away .
66021005	And He Who is seated on the throne said , See ! I make all things new . Also He said , Record this , for these sayings are faithful ( accurate , incorruptible , and trustworthy ) and true ( genuine ) .
66021006	And He [ further ] said to me , It is done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . To the thirsty I [ Myself ] will give water without price from the fountain ( springs ) of the water of Life .
66021007	He who is victorious shall inherit all these things , and I will be God to him and he shall be My son .
66021008	But as for the cowards and the ignoble and the contemptible and the cravenly lacking in courage and the cowardly submissive , and as for the unbelieving and faithless , and as for the depraved and defiled with abominations , and as for murderers and the lewd and adulterous and the practicers of magic arts and the idolaters ( those who give supreme devotion to anyone or anything other than God ) and all liars ( those who knowingly convey untruth by word or deed ) -- [ all of these shall have ] their part in the lake that blazes with fire and brimstone . This is the second death .
66021009	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven final plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) came and spoke to me . He said , Come with me ! I will show you the bride , the Lamb’s wife .
66021010	Then in the Spirit He conveyed me away to a vast and lofty mountain and exhibited to me the holy ( hallowed , consecrated ) city of Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God ,
66021011	Clothed in God’s glory [ in all its splendor and radiance ] . The luster of it resembled a rare and most precious jewel , like jasper , shining clear as crystal .
66021012	It had a massive and high wall with twelve [ large ] gates , and at the gates [ there were stationed ] twelve angels , and [ on the gates ] the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were written :
66021013	On the east side three gates , on the north side three gates , on the south side three gates , and on the west side three gates .
66021014	And the wall of the city had twelve foundation [ stones ] , and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	And he who spoke to me had a golden measuring reed ( rod ) to measure the city and its gates and its wall .
66021016	The city lies in a square , its length being the same as its width . And he measured the city with his reed -- 12,000 stadia ( about 1,500 miles ) ; its length and width and height are the same .
66021017	He measured its wall also -- 144 cubits ( about 72 yards ) by a man’s measure [ of a cubit from his elbow to his third fingertip ] , which is [ the measure ] of the angel .
66021018	The wall was built of jasper , while the city [ itself was of ] pure gold , clear and transparent like glass .
66021019	The foundation [ stones ] of the wall of the city were ornamented with all of the precious stones . The first foundation [ stone ] was jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony ( or white agate ) , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	The fifth onyx , the sixth sardius , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls , each separate gate being built of one solid pearl . And the main street ( the broadway ) of the city was of gold as pure and translucent as glass .
66021022	I saw no temple in the city , for the Lord God Omnipotent [ Himself ] and the Lamb [ Himself ] are its temple .
66021023	And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to give light to it , for the splendor and radiance ( glory ) of God illuminate it , and the Lamb is its lamp .
66021024	The nations shall walk by its light and the rulers and leaders of the earth shall bring into it their glory .
66021025	And its gates shall never be closed by day , and there shall be no night there .
66021026	They shall bring the glory ( the splendor and majesty ) and the honor of the nations into it .
66021027	But nothing that defiles or profanes or is unwashed shall ever enter it , nor anyone who commits abominations ( unclean , detestable , morally repugnant things ) or practices falsehood , but only those whose names are recorded in the Lamb’s Book of Life .
66022001	THEN HE showed me the river whose waters give life , sparkling like crystal , flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66022002	Through the middle of the broadway of the city ; also , on either side of the river was the tree of life with its twelve varieties of fruit , yielding each month its fresh crop ; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing and the restoration of the nations .
66022003	There shall no longer exist there anything that is accursed ( detestable , foul , offensive , impure , hateful , or horrible ) . But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it , and His servants shall worship Him [ pay divine honors to Him and do Him holy service ] .
66022004	They shall see His face , and His name shall be on their foreheads .
66022005	And there shall be no more night ; they have no need for lamplight or sunlight , for the Lord God will illuminate them and be their light , and they shall reign [ as kings ] forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) .
66022006	And he [ of the seven angels further ] said to me , These statements are reliable ( worthy of confidence ) and genuine ( true ) . And the Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , has sent His messenger ( angel ) to make known and exhibit to His servants what must soon come to pass .
66022007	And behold , I am coming speedily . Blessed ( happy and to be envied ) is he who observes and lays to heart and keeps the truths of the prophecy ( the predictions , consolations , and warnings ) contained in this [ little ] book .
66022008	And I , John , am he who heard and witnessed these things . And when I heard and saw them , I fell prostrate before the feet of the messenger ( angel ) who showed them to me , to worship him .
66022009	But he said to me , Refrain ! [ You must not do that ! ] I am [ only ] a fellow servant along with yourself and with your brethren the prophets and with those who are mindful of and practice [ the truths contained in ] the messages of this book . Worship God !
66022010	And he [ further ] told me , Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book and make no secret of them , for the time when things are brought to a crisis and the period of their fulfillment is near .
66022011	He who is unrighteous ( unjust , wicked ) , let him be unrighteous still ; and he who is filthy ( vile , impure ) , let him be filthy still ; and he who is righteous ( just , upright , in right standing with God ) , let him do right still ; and he who is holy , let him be holy still .
66022012	Behold , I am coming soon , and I shall bring My wages and rewards with Me , to repay and render to each one just what his own actions and his own work merit .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last ( the Before all and the End of all ) .
66022014	Blessed ( happy and to be envied ) are those who cleanse their garments , that they may have the authority and right to [ approach ] the tree of life and to enter through the gates into the city .
66022015	[ But ] without are the dogs and those who practice sorceries ( magic arts ) and impurity [ the lewd , adulterers ] and the murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and deals in falsehood ( untruth , error , deception , cheating ) .
66022016	I , Jesus , have sent My messenger ( angel ) to you to witness and to give you assurance of these things for the churches ( assemblies ) . I am the Root ( the Source ) and the Offspring of David , the radiant and brilliant Morning Star .
66022017	The [ Holy ] Spirit and the bride ( the church , the true Christians ) say , Come ! And let him who is listening say , Come ! And let everyone come who is thirsty [ who is painfully conscious of his need of those things by which the soul is refreshed , supported , and strengthened ] ; and whoever [ earnestly ] desires to do it , let him come , take , appropriate , and drink the water of Life without cost .
66022018	I [ personally solemnly ] warn everyone who listens to the statements of the prophecy [ the predictions and the consolations and admonitions pertaining to them ] in this book : If anyone shall add anything to them , God will add and lay upon him the plagues ( the afflictions and the calamities ) that are recorded and described in this book .
66022019	And if anyone cancels or takes away from the statements of the book of this prophecy [ these predictions relating to Christ’s kingdom and its speedy triumph , together with the consolations and admonitions or warnings pertaining to them ] , God will cancel and take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the city of holiness ( purity and hallowedness ) , which are described and promised in this book .
66022020	He Who gives this warning and affirms and testifies to these things says , Yes ( it is true ) . [ Surely ] I am coming quickly ( swiftly , speedily ) . Amen ( so let it be ) ! Yes , come , Lord Jesus !
66022021	The grace ( blessing and favor ) of the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with all the saints ( God’s holy people , those set apart for God , to be , as it were , exclusively His ) . Amen ( so let it be ) !
