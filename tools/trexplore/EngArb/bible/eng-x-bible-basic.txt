40001001	The book of the generations of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
40001002	The son of Abraham was Isaac ; and the son of Isaac was Jacob ; and the sons of Jacob were Judah and his brothers ;
40001003	And the sons of Judah were Perez and Zerah by Tamar ; and the son of Perez was Hezron ; and the son of Hezron was Ram ;
40001004	And the son of Ram was Amminadab ; and the son of Amminadab was Nahshon ; and the son of Nahshon was Salmon ;
40001005	And the son of Salmon by Rahab was Boaz ; and the son of Boaz by Ruth was Obed ; and the son of Obed was Jesse ;
40001006	And the son of Jesse was David the king ; and the son of David was Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah ;
40001007	And the son of Solomon was Rehoboam ; and the son of Rehoboam was Abijah ; and the son of Abijah was Asa ;
40001008	And the son of Asa was Jehoshaphat ; and the son of Jehoshaphat was Joram ; and the son of Joram was Uzziah ;
40001009	And the son of Uzziah was Jotham ; and the son of Jotham was Ahaz ; and the son of Ahaz was Hezekiah ;
40001010	And the son of Hezekiah was Manasseh ; and the son of Manasseh was Amon ; and the son of Amon was Josiah ;
40001011	And the sons of Josiah were Jechoniah and his brothers , at the time of the taking away to Babylon .
40001012	And after the taking away to Babylon , Jechoniah had a son Shealtiel ; and Shealtiel had Zerubbabel ;
40001013	And Zerubbabel had Abiud ; and Abiud had Eliakim ; and Eliakim had Azor ;
40001014	And Azor had Zadok ; and Zadok had Achim ; and Achim had Eliud ;
40001015	And Eliud had Eleazar ; and Eleazar had Matthan ; and Matthan had Jacob ;
40001016	And the son of Jacob was Joseph the husband of Mary , who gave birth to Jesus , whose name is Christ .
40001017	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David to the taking away to Babylon , fourteen generations ; and from the taking away to Babylon to the coming of Christ , fourteen generations .
40001018	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way : when his mother Mary was going to be married to Joseph , before they came together the discovery was made that she was with child by the Holy Spirit .
40001019	And Joseph , her husband , being an upright man , and not desiring to make her a public example , had a mind to put her away privately .
40001020	But when he was giving thought to these things , an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream , saying , Joseph , son of David , have no fear of taking Mary as your wife ; because that which is in her body is of the Holy Spirit .
40001021	And she will give birth to a son ; and you will give him the name Jesus ; for he will give his people salvation from their sins .
40001022	Now all this took place so that the word of the Lord by the prophet might come true ,
40001023	See , the virgin will be with child , and will give birth to a son , and they will give him the name Immanuel , that is , God with us .
40001024	And Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had said to him , and took her as his wife ;
40001025	And he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son ; and he gave him the name Jesus .
40002001	Now when the birth of Jesus took place in Beth-lehem of Judaea , in the days of Herod the king , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
40002002	Saying , Where is the King of the Jews whose birth has now taken place ? We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship .
40002003	And when it came to the ears of Herod the king , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be .
40002005	And they said to him , In Beth-lehem of Judaea ; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet ,
40002006	You Beth-lehem , in the land of Judah , are not the least among the chiefs of Judah : out of you will come a ruler , who will be the keeper of my people Israel .
40002007	Then Herod sent for the wise men privately , and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen .
40002008	And he sent them to Beth-lehem and said , Go and make certain where the young child is ; and when you have seen him , let me have news of it , so that I may come and give him worship .
40002009	And after hearing the king , they went on their way ; and the star which they saw in the east went before them , till it came to rest over the place where the young child was .
40002010	And when they saw the star they were full of joy .
40002011	And they came into the house , and saw the young child with Mary , his mother ; and falling down on their faces they gave him worship ; and from their store they gave him offerings of gold , perfume , and spices .
40002012	And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod ; so they went into their country by another way .
40002013	And when they had gone , an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream , saying , Get up and take the young child and his mother , and go into Egypt , and do not go from there till I give you word ; for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death .
40002014	So he took the young child and his mother by night , and went into Egypt ;
40002015	And was there till the death of Herod ; so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true , Out of Egypt have I sent for my son .
40002016	Then Herod , when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men , was very angry ; and he sent out , and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it , from two years old and under , acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men .
40002017	Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true ,
40002018	In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow , Rachel weeping for her children , and she would not be comforted for their loss .
40002019	But when Herod was dead , an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
40002020	Saying , Get up and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : because they who were attempting to take the young child's life are dead .
40002021	And he got up , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
40002022	But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod , he was in fear of going there ; and God having given him news of the danger in a dream , he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee .
40002023	And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth : so that the word of the prophets might come true , He will be named a Nazarene .
40003001	And in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the waste land of Judaea ,
40003002	Saying , Let your hearts be turned from sin ; for the kingdom of heaven is near .
40003003	For this is he of whom Isaiah the prophet said , The voice of one crying in the waste land , Make ready the way of the Lord , make his roads straight .
40003004	Now John was clothed in camel's hair , with a leather band about him ; and his food was locusts and honey .
40003005	Then Jerusalem and all Judaea went out to him , and all the people from near Jordan ;
40003006	And they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan , saying openly that they had done wrong .
40003007	But when he saw a number of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said to them , Offspring of snakes , at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come ?
40003008	Let your change of heart be seen in your works :
40003009	And say not to yourselves , We have Abraham for our father ; because I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children for Abraham .
40003010	And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees ; every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down , and put into the fire .
40003011	Truly , I give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed ; but he who comes after me is greater than I , whose shoes I am not good enough to take up : he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire :
40003012	In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain ; he will put the good grain in his store , but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out .
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan , to be given baptism by him .
40003014	But John would have kept him back , saying , It is I who have need of baptism from you , and do you come to me ?
40003015	But Jesus made answer , saying to him , Let it be so now : because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete . Then he gave him baptism .
40003016	And Jesus , having been given baptism , straight away went up from the water ; and , the heavens opening , he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him as a dove ;
40003017	And a voice came out of heaven , saying , This is my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well pleased .
40004001	Then Jesus was sent by the Spirit into the waste land to be tested by the Evil One .
40004002	And after going without food for forty days and forty nights , he was in need of it .
40004003	And the Evil One came and said to him , If you are the Son of God , give the word for these stones to become bread .
40004004	But he made answer and said , It is in the Writings , Bread is not man's only need , but every word which comes out of the mouth of God .
40004005	Then the Evil One took him to the holy town ; and he put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him ,
40004006	If you are the Son of God , let yourself go down ; for it is in the Writings , He will give his angels care over you ; and , In their hands they will keep you up , so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone .
40004007	Jesus said to him , Again it is in the Writings , You may not put the Lord your God to the test .
40004008	Again , the Evil One took him up to a very high mountain , and let him see all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them ;
40004009	And he said to him , All these things will I give you , if you will go down on your face and give me worship .
40004010	Then said Jesus to him , Away , Satan : for it is in the Writings , Give worship to the Lord your God and be his servant only .
40004011	Then the Evil One went away from him , and angels came and took care of him .
40004012	Now when it came to his ears that John had been put in prison , he went away to Galilee ;
40004013	And going away from Nazareth , he came and made his living-place in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali :
40004014	So that the word of the prophet Isaiah might come true ,
40004015	The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , by the way of the sea , the other side of Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ,
40004016	The people who were in the dark saw a great light , and to those in the land of the shade of death did the dawn come up .
40004017	From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying , Let your hearts be turned from sin , for the kingdom of heaven is near .
40004018	And when he was walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon , whose other name was Peter , and Andrew , his brother , who were putting a net into the sea ; for they were fishermen .
40004019	And he said to them , Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men .
40004020	And straight away they let go the nets and went after him .
40004021	And going on from there he saw two other brothers , James , the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother , in the boat with their father , stitching up their nets ; and he said , Come .
40004022	And they went straight from the boat and their father and came after him .
40004023	And Jesus went about in all Galilee , teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom , and making well those who were ill with any disease among the people .
40004024	And news of him went out through all Syria ; and they took to him all who were ill with different diseases and pains , those having evil spirits and those who were off their heads , and those who had no power of moving . And he made them well .
40004025	And there went after him great numbers from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from the other side of Jordan .
40005001	And seeing great masses of people he went up into the mountain ; and when he was seated his disciples came to him .
40005002	And with these words he gave them teaching , saying ,
40005003	Happy are the poor in spirit : for the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
40005004	Happy are those who are sad : for they will be comforted .
40005005	Happy are the gentle : for the earth will be their heritage .
40005006	Happy are those whose heart's desire is for righteousness : for they will have their desire .
40005007	Happy are those who have mercy : for they will be given mercy .
40005008	Happy are the clean in heart : for they will see God .
40005009	Happy are the peacemakers : for they will be named sons of God .
40005010	Happy are those who are attacked on account of righteousness : for the kingdom of heaven will be theirs .
40005011	Happy are you when men give you a bad name , and are cruel to you , and say all evil things against you falsely , because of me .
40005012	Be glad and full of joy ; for great is your reward in heaven : for so were the prophets attacked who were before you .
40005013	You are the salt of the earth ; but if its taste goes from the salt , how will you make it salt again ? it is then good for nothing but to be put out and crushed under foot by men .
40005014	You are the light of the world . A town put on a hill may be seen by all .
40005015	And a burning light is not put under a vessel , but on its table ; so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house .
40005016	Even so let your light be shining before men , so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven .
40005017	Let there be no thought that I have come to put an end to the law or the prophets . I have not come for destruction , but to make complete .
40005018	Truly I say to you , Till heaven and earth come to an end , not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law , till all things are done .
40005019	Whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws , teaching men to do the same , will be named least in the kingdom of heaven ; but he who keeps the laws , teaching others to keep them , will be named great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I say to you , If your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , you will never go into the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	You have knowledge that it was said in old times , You may not put to death ; and , Whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged :
40005022	But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged ; and he who says to his brother , Raca , will be in danger from the Sanhedrin ; and whoever says , You foolish one , will be in danger of the hell of fire .
40005023	If then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you ,
40005024	While your offering is still before the altar , first go and make peace with your brother , then come and make your offering .
40005025	Come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law , while you are with him on the way , for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison .
40005026	Truly I say to you , You will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing .
40005027	You have knowledge that it was said , You may not have connection with another man's wife :
40005028	But I say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart .
40005029	And if your right eye is a cause of trouble to you , take it out and put it away from you ; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part , than for all your body to go into hell .
40005030	And if your right hand is a cause of trouble to you , let it be cut off and put it away from you ; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part , than for all your body to go into hell .
40005031	Again , it was said , Whoever puts away his wife has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose :
40005032	But I say to you that everyone who puts away his wife for any other cause but the loss of her virtue , makes her false to her husband ; and whoever takes her as his wife after she is put away , is no true husband to her .
40005033	Again , you have knowledge that it was said in old times , Do not take false oaths , but give effect to your oaths to the Lord :
40005034	But I say to you , Take no oaths at all : not by the heaven , because it is the seat of God ;
40005035	Or by the earth , because it is the resting-place for his foot ; or by Jerusalem , because it is the town of the great King .
40005036	You may not take an oath by your head , because you are not able to make one hair white or black .
40005037	But let your words be simply , Yes or No : and whatever is more than these is of the Evil One .
40005038	You have knowledge that it was said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
40005039	But I say to you , Do not make use of force against an evil man ; but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned .
40005040	And if any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat , do not keep back your robe from him .
40005041	And whoever makes you go one mile , go with him two .
40005042	Give to him who comes with a request , and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it .
40005043	You have knowledge that it was said , Have love for your neighbour , and hate for him who is against you :
40005044	But I say to you , Have love for those who are against you , and make prayer for those who are cruel to you ;
40005045	So that you may be the sons of your Father in heaven ; for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good , and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner .
40005046	For if you have love for those who have love for you , what credit is it to you ? do not the tax-farmers the same ?
40005047	And if you say , Good day , to your brothers only , what do you do more than others ? do not even the Gentiles the same ?
40005048	Be then complete in righteousness , even as your Father in heaven is complete .
40006001	Take care not to do your good works before men , to be seen by them ; or you will have no reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	When then you give money to the poor , do not make a noise about it , as the false-hearted men do in the Synagogues and in the streets , so that they may have glory from men . Truly , I say to you , They have their reward .
40006003	But when you give money , let not your left hand see what your right hand does :
40006004	So that your giving may be in secret ; and your Father , who sees in secret , will give you your reward .
40006005	And when you make your prayers , be not like the false-hearted men , who take pleasure in getting up and saying their prayers in the Synagogues and at the street turnings so that they may be seen by men . Truly I say to you , They have their reward .
40006006	But when you make your prayer , go into your private room , and , shutting the door , say a prayer to your Father in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will give you your reward .
40006007	And in your prayer do not make use of the same words again and again , as the Gentiles do : for they have the idea that God will give attention to them because of the number of their words .
40006008	So be not like them ; because your Father has knowledge of your needs even before you make your requests to him .
40006009	Let this then be your prayer : Our Father in heaven , may your name be kept holy .
40006010	Let your kingdom come . Let your pleasure be done , as in heaven , so on earth .
40006011	Give us this day bread for our needs .
40006012	And make us free of our debts , as we have made those free who are in debt to us .
40006013	And let us not be put to the test , but keep us safe from the Evil One .
40006014	For if you let men have forgiveness for their sins , you will have forgiveness from your Father in heaven .
40006015	But if you do not let men have forgiveness for their sins , you will not have forgiveness from your Father for your sins .
40006016	And when you go without food , be not sad-faced as the false-hearted are . For they go about with changed looks , so that men may see that they are going without food . Truly I say to you , They have their reward .
40006017	But when you go without food , put oil on your head and make your face clean ;
40006018	So that no one may see that you are going without food , but your Father in secret ; and your Father , who sees in secret , will give you your reward .
40006019	Make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth , where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather , and where thieves may come in by force and take it away .
40006020	But make a store for yourselves in heaven , where it will not be turned to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away :
40006021	For where your wealth is , there will your heart be .
40006022	The light of the body is the eye ; if then your eye is true , all your body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eye is evil , all your body will be dark . If then the light which is in you is dark , how dark it will be !
40006024	No man is able to be a servant to two masters : for he will have hate for the one and love for the other , or he will keep to one and have no respect for the other . You may not be servants of God and of wealth .
40006025	So I say to you , Take no thought for your life , about food or drink , or about clothing for your body . Is not life more than food , and the body more than its clothing ?
40006026	See the birds of heaven ; they do not put seeds in the earth , they do not get in grain , or put it in store-houses ; and your Father in heaven gives them food . Are you not of much more value than they ?
40006027	And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself a cubit taller ?
40006028	And why are you troubled about clothing ? See the flowers of the field , how they come up ; they do no work , they make no thread :
40006029	But I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these .
40006030	But if God gives such clothing to the grass of the field , which is here today and tomorrow is put into the oven , will he not much more give you clothing , O you of little faith ?
40006031	Then do not be full of care , saying , What are we to have for food or drink ? or , With what may we be clothed ?
40006032	Because the Gentiles go in search of all these things : for your Father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things :
40006033	But let your first care be for his kingdom and his righteousness ; and all these other things will be given to you in addition .
40006034	Then have no care for tomorrow : tomorrow will take care of itself . Take the trouble of the day as it comes .
40007001	Be not judges of others , and you will not be judged .
40007002	For as you have been judging , so you will be judged , and with your measure will it be measured to you .
40007003	And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye , but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye ?
40007004	Or how will you say to your brother , Let me take out the grain of dust from your eye , when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye ?
40007005	You false one , first take out the bit of wood from your eye , then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brother's eye .
40007006	Do not give that which is holy to the dogs , or put your jewels before pigs , for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you .
40007007	Make a request , and it will be answered ; what you are searching for you will get ; give the sign , and the door will be open to you :
40007008	Because to everyone who makes a request , it will be given ; and he who is searching will get his desire , and to him who gives the sign , the door will be open .
40007009	Or which of you , if his son makes a request for bread , will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he makes a request for a fish , will give him a snake ?
40007011	If you , then , being evil , are able to give good things to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him ?
40007012	All those things , then , which you would have men do to you , even so do you to them : because this is the law and the prophets .
40007013	Go in by the narrow door ; for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction , and great numbers go in by it .
40007014	For narrow is the door and hard the road to life , and only a small number make discovery of it .
40007015	Be on the watch for false prophets , who come to you in sheep's clothing , but inside they are cruel wolves .
40007016	By their fruits you will get knowledge of them . Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles ?
40007017	Even so , every good tree gives good fruit ; but the bad tree gives evil fruit .
40007018	It is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit , and a bad tree will not give good fruit .
40007019	Every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire .
40007020	So by their fruits you will get knowledge of them .
40007021	Not everyone who says to me , Lord , Lord , will go into the kingdom of heaven ; but he who does the pleasure of my Father in heaven .
40007022	A great number will say to me on that day , Lord , Lord , were we not prophets in your name , and did we not by your name send out evil spirits , and by your name do works of power ?
40007023	And then will I say to them , I never had knowledge of you : go from me , you workers of evil .
40007024	Everyone , then , to whom my words come and who does them , will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock ;
40007025	And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house , but it was not moved ; because it was based on the rock .
40007026	And everyone to whom my words come and who does them not , will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand ;
40007027	And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house ; and it came down and great was its fall .
40007028	And it came about , when Jesus had come to the end of these words , that the people were surprised at his teaching ,
40007029	for he was teaching as one having authority , and not as their scribes .
40008001	And when he had come down from the mountain , great numbers of people came after him .
40008002	And a leper came and gave him worship , saying , Lord , if it is your pleasure , you have power to make me clean .
40008003	And he put his hand on him , saying , It is my pleasure ; be clean . And straight away he was made clean .
40008004	And Jesus said to him , See that you say nothing about this to anyone ; but go and let the priest see you and make the offering which was ordered by Moses , for a witness to them .
40008005	And when Jesus was come into Capernaum , a certain captain came to him with a request ,
40008006	Saying , Lord , my servant is ill in bed at the house , with no power in his body , and in great pain .
40008007	And he said to him , I will come and make him well .
40008008	And the captain in answer said , Lord , I am not good enough for you to come under my roof ; but only say the word , and my servant will be made well .
40008009	Because I myself am a man under authority , having under me fighting men ; and I say to this one , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my servant , Do this , and he does it .
40008010	And when these words came to the ears of Jesus he was surprised , and said to those who came after him , Truly I say to you , I have not seen such great faith , no , not in Israel .
40008011	And I say to you that numbers will come from the east and the west , and will take their seats with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven :
40008012	But the sons of the kingdom will be put out into the dark , and there will be weeping and cries of pain .
40008013	And Jesus said to the captain , Go in peace ; as your faith is , so let it be done to you . And the servant was made well in that hour .
40008014	And when Jesus had come into Peter's house , he saw his wife's mother in bed , very ill .
40008015	And he put his hand on hers and the disease went from her , and she got up and took care of his needs .
40008016	And in the evening , they took to him a number of people who had evil spirits ; and he sent the spirits out of them with a word , and made well all who were ill ;
40008017	So that the word of Isaiah the prophet might come true : He himself took our pains and our diseases .
40008018	Now when Jesus saw a great mass of people about him , he gave an order to go to the other side .
40008019	And there came a scribe and said to him , Master , I will come after you wherever you go .
40008020	And Jesus said to him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of heaven have a resting-place ; but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head .
40008021	And another of the disciples said to him , Lord , let me first go and give the last honours to my father .
40008022	But Jesus said to him , Come after me ; and let the dead take care of their dead .
40008023	And when he had got into a boat , his disciples went after him .
40008024	And there came up a great storm in the sea , so that the boat was covered with the waves : but he was sleeping .
40008025	And they came to him , and , awaking him , said , Help , Lord ; destruction is near .
40008026	And he said to them , Why are you full of fear , O you of little faith ? Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
40008027	And the men were full of wonder , saying , What sort of man is this , that even the winds and the sea do his orders ?
40008028	And when he had come to the other side , to the country of the Gadarenes , there came out to him from the place of the dead , two who had evil spirits , so violent that no man was able to go that way .
40008029	And they gave a loud cry , saying , What have we to do with you , you Son of God ? Have you come here to give us punishment before the time ?
40008030	Now there was , some distance away , a great herd of pigs taking their food .
40008031	And the evil spirits made strong prayers to him , saying , If you send us out , let us go into the herd of pigs .
40008032	And he said to them , Go . And they came out , and went into the pigs ; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water .
40008033	And their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything , and of the men who had the evil spirits .
40008034	And all the town came out to Jesus ; and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country .
40009001	And he got into a boat and went across and came to his town .
40009002	And they took to him a man stretched on a bed who had no power of moving ; and Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the man who was ill , Son , take heart ; you have forgiveness for your sins .
40009003	And some of the scribes said among themselves , This man has no respect for God .
40009004	And Jesus , having knowledge of what was in their minds , said , Why are your thoughts evil ?
40009005	For which is the simpler , to say , You have forgiveness for your sins ; or to say , Get up and go ?
40009006	But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins , ( then said he to the man who was ill , ) Get up , and take up your bed , and go to your house .
40009007	And he got up and went away to his house .
40009008	But when the people saw it they were full of fear , and gave glory to God who had given such authority to men .
40009009	And when Jesus was going from there , he saw a man whose name was Matthew , seated at the place where taxes were taken ; and he said to him , Come after me . And he got up and went after him .
40009010	And it came about , when he was in the house taking food , that a number of tax-farmers and sinners came and took their places with Jesus and his disciples .
40009011	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said to his disciples , Why does your Master take food with tax-farmers and sinners ?
40009012	But on hearing this he said , Those who are well have no need of a medical man , but those who are ill .
40009013	But go and take to heart the sense of these words , My desire is for mercy , not offerings : for I have come not to get the upright , but sinners .
40009014	Then the disciples of John came to him , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees frequently go without food , but your disciples do not ?
40009015	And Jesus said to them , Will the friends of the newly-married man be sad as long as he is with them ? But the days will come when he will be taken away from them , and then will they go without food .
40009016	And no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat , for by pulling away from the old , it makes a worse hole .
40009017	And men do not put new wine into old wine-skins ; or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out , and the skins are of no more use : but they put new wine into new wine-skins , and so the two will be safe .
40009018	While he was saying these things to them , there came a ruler and gave him worship , saying , My daughter is even now dead ; but come and put your hand on her , and she will come back to life .
40009019	And Jesus got up and went after him , and so did his disciples .
40009020	And a woman , who for twelve years had had a flow of blood , came after him , and put her hand on the edge of his robe :
40009021	Because , she said to herself , if I may but put my hand on his robe , I will be made well .
40009022	But Jesus , turning and seeing her , said , Daughter , take heart ; your faith has made you well . And the woman was made well from that hour .
40009023	And when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise ,
40009024	He said , Make room ; for the girl is not dead , but sleeping . And they were laughing at him .
40009025	But when the people were sent out , he went in and took her by the hand ; and the girl got up .
40009026	And the news of it went out into all that land .
40009027	And when Jesus went on from there , two blind men came after him , crying out , Have mercy on us , you Son of David .
40009028	And when he had come into the house , the blind men came to him ; and Jesus said to them , Have you faith that I am able to do this ? They said to him , Yes , Lord .
40009029	Then he put his hand on their eyes , saying , As your faith is , let it be done to you .
40009030	And their eyes were made open . And Jesus said to them sharply , Let no man have knowledge of it .
40009031	But they went out and gave news of him in all that land .
40009032	And while they were going away , there came to him a man without the power of talking , and with an evil spirit .
40009033	And when the evil spirit had been sent out , the man had the power of talking : and they were all surprised , saying , Such a thing has never been seen in Israel .
40009034	But the Pharisees said , By the ruler of evil spirits , he sends evil spirits out of men .
40009035	And Jesus went about all the towns and small places , teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain .
40009036	But when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them , because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , There is much grain but not enough men to get it in .
40009038	Make prayer , then , to the Lord of the grain-fields , that he may send out workers to get in his grain .
40010001	And he got together his twelve disciples and gave them the power of driving out unclean spirits , and of making well all sorts of disease and pain .
40010002	Now the names of the twelve are these : The first , Simon , who is named Peter , and Andrew , his brother ; James , the son of Zebedee , and John , his brother ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew , the tax-farmer ; James , the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Zealot , and Judas Iscariot , who was false to him .
40010005	These twelve Jesus sent out and gave them orders , saying , Do not go among the Gentiles , or into any town of Samaria ,
40010006	But go to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel ,
40010007	And , on your way , say , The kingdom of heaven is near .
40010008	Make well those who are ill , give life to the dead , make lepers clean , send evil spirits out of men ; freely it has been given to you , freely give .
40010009	Take no gold or silver or copper in your pockets ;
40010010	Take no bag for your journey and do not take two coats or shoes or a stick : for the workman has a right to his food .
40010011	And into whatever town or small place you go , make search there for someone who is respected , and make his house your resting-place till you go away .
40010012	And when you go in , say , May peace be on this house .
40010013	And if the house is good enough , let your peace come on it : but if not , let your peace come back to you .
40010014	And whoever will not take you in , or give ear to your words , when you go out from that house or that town , put off its dust from your feet .
40010015	Truly I say to you , It will be better for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of God's judging than for that town .
40010016	See , I send you out as sheep among wolves . Be then as wise as snakes , and as gentle as doves .
40010017	But be on the watch against men : for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins , and in their Synagogues they will give you blows ;
40010018	And you will come before rulers and kings because of me , for a witness to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	But when you are given up into their hands , do not be troubled about what to say or how to say it : for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you ;
40010020	Because it is not you who say the words , but the Spirit of your Father in you .
40010021	And brother will give up brother to death , and the father his child : and children will go against their fathers and mothers , and put them to death .
40010022	And you will be hated by all men because of my name : but he who is strong to the end will have salvation .
40010023	But when they are cruel to you in one town , go in flight to another : for truly , I say to you , You will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of man comes .
40010024	A disciple is not greater than his master , or a servant than his lord .
40010025	It is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have given the name Beelzebub to the master of the house , how much more to those of his house !
40010026	Have , then , no fear of them : because nothing is covered which will not come to light , or secret which will not be made clear .
40010027	What I say to you in the dark , say in the light : and what comes to your ear secretly , say publicly from the house-tops .
40010028	And have no fear of those who put to death the body , but are not able to put to death the soul . But have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell .
40010029	Are not sparrows two a farthing ? and not one of them comes to an end without your Father :
40010030	But the hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	Then have no fear ; you are of more value than a flock of sparrows .
40010032	To everyone , then , who gives witness to me before men , I will give witness before my Father in heaven .
40010033	But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me , I will say that I have no knowledge of him before my Father in heaven .
40010034	Do not have the thought that I have come to send peace on the earth ; I came not to send peace but a sword .
40010035	For I have come to put a man against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law :
40010036	And a man will be hated by those of his house .
40010037	He who has more love for his father or mother than for me is not good enough for me ; he who has more love for son or daughter than for me is not good enough for me .
40010038	And he who does not take his cross and come after me is not good enough for me .
40010039	He who has the desire to keep his life will have it taken from him , and he who gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him .
40010040	He who gives honour to you gives honour to me ; and he who gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me .
40010041	He who gives honour to a prophet , in the name of a prophet , will be given a prophet's reward ; and he who gives honour to an upright man , in the name of an upright man , will be given an upright man's reward .
40010042	And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only , in the name of a disciple , truly I say to you , he will not go without his reward .
40011001	And it came about that when Jesus had come to the end of giving these orders to his twelve disciples , he went away from there , teaching and preaching in their towns .
40011002	Now when John had news in prison of the works of the Christ , he sent his disciples
40011003	To say to him , Are you he who is to come , or are we waiting for another ?
40011004	And Jesus , answering , said to them , Go and give news to John of the things which you are seeing and hearing :
40011005	The blind see ; those who were not able to , are walking ; lepers are made clean ; those who were without hearing , now have their ears open ; the dead come to life again , and the poor have the good news given to them .
40011006	And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me .
40011007	And when they were going away , Jesus , talking of John , said to all the people , What went you out into the waste land to see ? a tall stem moving in the wind ?
40011008	But what went you out to see ? a man delicately clothed ? Those who have fair robes are in kings ' houses .
40011009	But why did you go out ? to see a prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	This is he of whom it has been said , See , I send my servant before your face , who will make ready your way before you .
40011011	Truly I say to you , Among the sons of women there has not been a greater than John the Baptist : but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
40011012	And from the days of John the Baptist till now , the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in , and men of force take it .
40011013	For all the prophets and the law were in force till John .
40011014	And if you are able to see it , this is Elijah who was to come .
40011015	He who has ears , let him give ear .
40011016	But what comparison may I make of this generation ? It is like children seated in the market-places , crying out to one another ,
40011017	We made music for you and you did not take part in the dance ; we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief .
40011018	For John came , taking no food or drink , and they say , He has an evil spirit .
40011019	The Son of man has come feasting , and they say , See , a lover of food and wine , a friend of tax-farmers and sinners ! And wisdom is judged to be right by her works .
40011020	Then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done , because they had not been turned from their sins .
40011021	Unhappy are you , Chorazin ! Unhappy are you , Beth-saida ! For if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by , clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on their heads .
40011022	But I say to you , It will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judging , than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , were you not to be lifted up to heaven ? you will go down into hell : for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have been here to this day .
40011024	But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom in the day of judging , than for you .
40011025	At that time Jesus made answer and said , I give praise to you , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning , and have made them clear to little children .
40011026	Yes , Father , for so it was pleasing in your eyes .
40011027	All things have been given to me by my Father ; and no one has knowledge of the Son , but the Father ; and no one has knowledge of the Father , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will make it clear .
40011028	Come to me , all you who are troubled and weighted down with care , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke on you and become like me , for I am gentle and without pride , and you will have rest for your souls ;
40011030	For my yoke is good , and the weight I take up is not hard .
40012001	At that time Jesus went through the fields on the Sabbath day ; and his disciples , being in need of food , were taking the heads of grain .
40012002	But the Pharisees , when they saw it , said to him , See , your disciples do that which it is not right to do on the Sabbath .
40012003	But he said to them , Have you no knowledge of what David did when he had need of food , and those who were with him ?
40012004	How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread which it was not right for him or for those who were with him to take , but only for the priests ?
40012005	Or is it not said in the law , how the Sabbath is broken by the priests in the Temple and they do no wrong ?
40012006	But I say to you that a greater thing than the Temple is here .
40012007	But if these words had been in your minds , My desire is for mercy and not for offerings , you would not have been judging those who have done no wrong .
40012008	For the Son of man is lord of the Sabbath .
40012009	And he went from there into their Synagogue :
40012010	And there was a man with a dead hand . And they put a question to him , saying , Is it right to make a man well on the Sabbath day ? so that they might have something against him .
40012011	And he said to them , Which of you , having a sheep , if it gets into a hole on the Sabbath day , will not put out a helping hand and get it back ?
40012012	Of how much more value is a man than a sheep ! For this reason it is right to do good on the Sabbath day .
40012013	Then said he to the man , Put out your hand . And he put it out , and it was made as well as the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and made designs against him , how they might put him to death .
40012015	And Jesus , having knowledge of this , went away from there , and a great number went after him ; and he made them all well ,
40012016	Ordering them not to give people word of him :
40012017	So that what was said by Isaiah the prophet might come true ,
40012018	See my servant , the man of my selection , my loved one in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit on him , and he will make my decision clear to the Gentiles .
40012019	His coming will not be with fighting or loud cries ; and his voice will not be lifted up in the streets .
40012020	The crushed stem will not be broken by him ; and the feebly burning light will he not put out , till he has made righteousness overcome all .
40012021	And in his name will the Gentiles put their hope .
40012022	Then they took to him one with an evil spirit , who was blind and had no power of talking : and he made him well so that he had the power of talking and seeing .
40012023	And all the people were surprised and said , Is not this the Son of David ?
40012024	But the Pharisees , hearing of it , said , This man only sends evil spirits out of men by Beelzebub , the ruler of evil spirits .
40012025	And having knowledge of their thoughts he said to them , Every kingdom having division in itself is made waste , and every town or house having division in itself will come to destruction .
40012026	And if Satan sends out Satan , he makes war against himself ; how then will he keep his kingdom ?
40012027	And if I by Beelzebub send evil spirits out of men , by whom do your sons send them out ? So let them be your judges .
40012028	But if I by the Spirit of God send out evil spirits , then is the kingdom of God come on you .
40012029	Or how may one go into a strong man's house and take his goods , if he does not first put cords round the strong man ? and then he may take his goods .
40012030	Whoever is not with me is against me ; and he who does not take part with me in getting people together , is driving them away .
40012031	So I say to you , Every sin and every evil word against God will have forgiveness ; but for evil words against the Spirit there will be no forgiveness .
40012032	And whoever says a word against the Son of man , will have forgiveness ; but whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit , will not have forgiveness in this life or in that which is to come .
40012033	Make the tree good , and its fruit good ; or make the tree bad , and its fruit bad ; for by its fruit you will get knowledge of the tree .
40012034	You offspring of snakes , how are you , being evil , able to say good things ? because out of the heart's store come the words of the mouth .
40012035	The good man out of his good store gives good things ; and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil things .
40012036	And I say to you that in the day when they are judged , men will have to give an account of every foolish word they have said .
40012037	For by your words will your righteousness be seen , and by your words you will be judged .
40012038	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees , hearing this , said to him , Master , we are looking for a sign from you .
40012039	But he , answering , said to them , An evil and false generation is looking for a sign ; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah :
40012040	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish , so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation : because they were turned from their sins at the preaching of Jonah ; and now a greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	The queen of the South will come up in the day of judging and give her decision against this generation : for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon ; and now a greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	But the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of a man , goes through dry places looking for rest , and getting it not .
40012044	Then he says , I will go back into my house from which I came out ; and when he comes , he sees that there is no one in it , but that it has been made fair and clean .
40012045	Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself , and they go in and make it their living-place : and the last condition of that man is worse than the first . Even so will it be with this evil generation .
40012046	While he was still talking to the people , his mother and his brothers came , desiring to have talk with him .
40012047	And one said to him , See , your mother and your brothers are outside , desiring to have talk with you .
40012048	But he in answer said to him who gave the news , Who is my mother and who are my brothers ?
40012049	And he put out his hand to his disciples and said , See , my mother and my brothers !
40012050	For whoever does the pleasure of my Father in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother .
40013001	On that day Jesus went out of the house and was seated by the seaside .
40013002	And great numbers of people came together to him , so that he got into a boat ; and the people took up their position by the sea .
40013003	And he gave them teaching in the form of a story , saying , A man went out to put seed in the earth ;
40013004	And while he did so , some seeds were dropped by the wayside , and the birds came and took them for food :
40013005	And some of the seed went among the stones , where it had not much earth , and straight away it came up because the earth was not deep :
40013006	And when the sun was high , it was burned ; and because it had no root it became dry and dead .
40013007	And some seeds went among thorns , and the thorns came up and they had no room for growth :
40013008	And some , falling on good earth , gave fruit , some a hundred , some sixty , some thirty times as much .
40013009	He who has ears , let him give ear .
40013010	And the disciples came and said to him , Why do you say things to them in the form of stories ?
40013011	And he said to them in answer , To you is given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
40013012	Because whoever has , to him will be given , and he will have more ; but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
40013013	For this reason I put things into the form of stories ; because they see without seeing , and give ear without hearing , and the sense is not clear to them .
40013014	And for them the words of Isaiah have come true , Though you give ear , you will not get knowledge ; and seeing , you will see , but the sense will not be clear to you :
40013015	For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut ; for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me , so that I might make them well .
40013016	But a blessing be on your eyes , because they see ; and on your ears , because they are open .
40013017	For truly , I say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see , and saw them not ; and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears , and they had it not .
40013018	Give ear , then , to the story of the man who put the seed in the earth .
40013019	When the word of the kingdom comes to anyone , and the sense of it is not clear to him , then the Evil One comes , and quickly takes away that which was put in his heart . He is the seed dropped by the wayside .
40013020	And that which went on the stones , this is he who , hearing the word , straight away takes it with joy ;
40013021	But having no root in himself , he goes on for a time ; and when trouble comes or pain , because of the word , he quickly becomes full of doubts .
40013022	And that which was dropped among the thorns , this is he who has the word ; and the cares of this life , and the deceits of wealth , put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit .
40013023	And the seed which was put in good earth , this is he who gives ear to the word , and gets the sense of it ; who gives fruit , some a hundred , some sixty , some thirty times as much .
40013024	And he gave them another story , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field :
40013025	But while men were sleeping , one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain , and went away .
40013026	But when the green stem came up and gave fruit , the evil plants were seen at the same time .
40013027	And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him , Sir , did you not put good seed in your field ? how then has it evil plants ?
40013028	And he said , Someone has done this in hate . And the servants say to him , Is it your pleasure that we go and take them up ?
40013029	But he says , No , for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants , you may be rooting up the grain with them .
40013030	Let them come up together till the getting in of the grain ; and then I will say to the workers , Take up first the evil plants , and put them together for burning : but put the grain into my store-house .
40013031	He put another story before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field :
40013032	Which is smaller than all seeds ; but when it has come up it is greater than the plants , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of heaven come and make their resting-places in its branches .
40013033	Another story he gave to them : The kingdom of heaven is like leaven , which a woman took , and put in three measures of meal , till it was all leavened .
40013034	All these things Jesus said to the people in the form of stories ; and without a story he said nothing to them :
40013035	That it might come true which was said by the prophet , Opening my mouth , I will give out stories ; I will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time .
40013036	Then he went away from the people , and went into the house ; and his disciples came to him , saying , Make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field .
40013037	And he made answer and said , He who puts the good seed in the earth is the Son of man ;
40013038	And the field is the world ; and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom ; and the evil seeds are the sons of the Evil One ;
40013039	And he who put them in the earth is Satan ; and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world ; and those who get it in are the angels .
40013040	As then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire , so will it be in the end of the world .
40013041	The Son of man will send out his angels , and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error , and all those who do wrong ,
40013042	And will put them into the fire ; there will be weeping and cries of sorrow .
40013043	Then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears , let him give ear .
40013044	The kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field , which a man came across and put back again ; and in his joy he goes and gives all he has , to get that field .
40013045	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a trader searching for beautiful jewels .
40013046	And having come across one jewel of great price , he went and gave all he had in exchange for it .
40013047	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net , which was put into the sea and took in every sort of fish :
40013048	When it was full , they took it up on the sands ; and seated there they put the good into vessels , but the bad they put away .
40013049	So will it be in the end of the world : the angels will come and take out the bad from the good ,
40013050	And will put them into the fire : there will be weeping and cries of sorrow .
40013051	Are all these things now clear to you ? They say to him , Yes .
40013052	And he said to them , For this reason every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house , who gives out from his store things new and old .
40013053	And when Jesus had come to the end of these stories he went away from there .
40013054	And coming into his country , he gave them teaching in their Synagogue , so that they were greatly surprised and said , Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power ?
40013055	Is not this the woodworker's son ? is not his mother named Mary ? and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
40013056	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? from where , then , has he all these things ?
40013057	And they were bitter against him . But Jesus said to them , A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family .
40013058	And the works of power which he did there were small in number because they had no faith .
40014001	At that time news of Jesus came to Herod the king ;
40014002	And he said to his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he has come back from the dead , and so these powers are working in him .
40014003	For Herod had taken John and put him in prison because of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife .
40014004	Because John had said to him , It is not right for you to have her .
40014005	And he would have put him to death , but for his fear of the people , because in their eyes John was a prophet .
40014006	But when Herod's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias was dancing before them , and Herod was pleased with her .
40014007	So he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for .
40014008	And she , at her mother's suggestion , said , Give me here on a plate the head of John the Baptist .
40014009	And the king was sad ; but because of his oaths and because of his guests , he gave the order for it to be given to her ;
40014010	And he sent and had John's head cut off in the prison .
40014011	And his head was put on a plate and given to the girl ; and she took it to her mother .
40014012	And his disciples came , and took up his body and put it in the earth ; and they went and gave Jesus news of what had taken place .
40014013	Now when it came to the ears of Jesus , he went away from there in a boat , to a waste place by himself : and the people hearing of it , went after him on foot from the towns .
40014014	And he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them , and made well those of them who were ill .
40014015	And when evening had come , the disciples came to him , saying , This place is waste land , and the time is now past ; send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food .
40014016	But Jesus said to them , There is no need for them to go away ; give them food yourselves .
40014017	And they say to him , We have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes .
40014018	And he said , Give them to me .
40014019	And he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass ; and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and , looking up to heaven , he said words of blessing , and made division of the food , and gave it to the disciples , and the disciples gave it to the people .
40014020	And they all took of the food and had enough : and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used .
40014021	And those who had food were about five thousand men , in addition to women and children .
40014022	And straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side , till he had sent the people away .
40014023	And after he had sent the people away , he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer : and when evening was come , he was there by himself .
40014024	But the boat was now in the middle of the sea , and was troubled by the waves : for the wind was against them .
40014025	And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea .
40014026	And when they saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they gave cries of fear .
40014027	But straight away Jesus said to them , Take heart ; it is I , have no fear .
40014028	And Peter , answering , said to him , Lord , if it is you , give me the order to come to you on the water .
40014029	And he said , Come . And Peter got out of the boat , and walking on the water , went to Jesus .
40014030	But when he saw the wind he was in fear and , starting to go down , he gave a cry , saying , Help , Lord .
40014031	And straight away Jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him , and said to him , O man of little faith , why were you in doubt ?
40014032	And when they had got into the boat , the wind went down .
40014033	And those who were in the boat gave him worship , saying , Truly you are the Son of God .
40014034	And when they had gone across , they came to land at Gennesaret .
40014035	And when the men of that place had news of him , they sent into all the country round about , and took to him all who were ill ,
40014036	With the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe : and all those who did so were made well .
40015001	Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes , saying ,
40015002	Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers ? for they take food with unwashed hands .
40015003	And in answer he said to them , Why do you , yourselves , go against the word of God on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you ?
40015004	For God said , Give honour to your father and mother : and , He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death .
40015005	But you say , If a man says to his father or his mother , That by which you might have had profit from me is given to God ;
40015006	There is no need for him to give honour to his father . And you have made the word of God without effect because of your teaching .
40015007	You false ones , well did Isaiah say of you ,
40015008	These people give me honour with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
40015009	But their worship is to no purpose , while they give as their teaching the rules of men .
40015010	And he got the people together and said to them , Give ear , and let my words be clear to you :
40015011	Not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean , but that which comes out of the mouth .
40015012	Then the disciples came and said to him , Did you see that the Pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears ?
40015013	But he said in answer , Every plant which my Father in heaven has not put in the earth , will be taken up by the roots .
40015014	Let them be : they are blind guides . And if a blind man is guiding a blind man , the two will go falling into a hole together .
40015015	Then Peter said to him , Make the story clear to us .
40015016	And he said , Are you , like them , still without wisdom ?
40015017	Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach , and is sent out as waste ?
40015018	But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart ; and they make a man unclean .
40015019	For out of the heart come evil thoughts , the taking of life , broken faith between the married , unclean desires of the flesh , taking of property , false witness , bitter words :
40015020	These are the things which make a man unclean ; but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean .
40015021	And Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	And a woman of Canaan came out from those parts , crying and saying , Have pity on me , O Lord , Son of David ; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit .
40015023	But he gave her no answer . And his disciples came and said to him , Send her away , for she is crying after us .
40015024	But he made answer and said , I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel .
40015025	But she came and gave him worship , saying , Help , Lord .
40015026	And he made answer and said , It is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs .
40015027	But she said , Yes , Lord : but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters ' table .
40015028	Then Jesus , answering , said to her , O woman , great is your faith : let your desire be done . And her daughter was made well from that hour .
40015029	And Jesus went from there and came to the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and took his seat there .
40015030	And there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body , or blind , or without voice , or wounded , or ill in any way , and a number of others ; they put them down at his feet and he made them well :
40015031	So that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking , the feeble were made strong , those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking , and the blind were able to see : and they gave glory to the God of Israel .
40015032	And Jesus got his disciples together and said , I have pity for the people , because they have now been with me three days and have no food : and I will not send them away without food , or they will have no strength for the journey .
40015033	And the disciples say to him , How may we get enough bread in a waste place , to give food to such a number of people ?
40015034	And Jesus says to them , How much bread have you ? And they said , Seven cakes , and some small fishes .
40015035	Then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth ,
40015036	And he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes ; and having given praise , he gave the broken bread to the disciples , and the disciples gave it to the people .
40015037	And they all took food , and had enough ; and they took up of the broken bits , seven baskets full .
40015038	And there were four thousand men who took food , together with women and children .
40015039	And when he had sent the people away , he got into the boat , and came into the country of Magadan .
40016001	And the Pharisees and Sadducees came and , testing him , made a request to him to give them a sign from heaven .
40016002	But in answer he said to them , At nightfall you say , The weather will be good , for the sky is red .
40016003	And in the morning , The weather will be bad today , for the sky is red and angry . You are able to see the face of heaven , but not the signs of the times .
40016004	An evil and false generation is searching after a sign ; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah . And he went away from them .
40016005	And when the disciples came to the other side they had not taken thought to get bread .
40016006	And Jesus said to them , Take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016007	And they were reasoning among themselves , saying , We took no bread .
40016008	And Jesus , seeing it , said , O you of little faith , why are you reasoning among yourselves , because you have no bread ?
40016009	Do you still not see , or keep in mind the five cakes of bread of the five thousand , and the number of baskets you took up ?
40016010	Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand , and the number of baskets you took up ?
40016011	How is it that you do not see that I was not talking to you about bread , but about keeping away from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ?
40016012	Then they saw that it was not the leaven of bread which he had in mind , but the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	Now when Jesus had come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he said , questioning his disciples , Who do men say that the Son of man is ?
40016014	And they said , Some say , John the Baptist ; some , Elijah ; and others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets .
40016015	He says to them , But who do you say that I am ?
40016016	And Simon Peter made answer and said , You are the Christ , the Son of the living God .
40016017	And Jesus made answer and said to him , A blessing on you , Simon Bar-jonah : because this knowledge has not come to you from flesh and blood , but from my Father in heaven .
40016018	And I say to you that you are Peter , and on this rock will my church be based , and the doors of hell will not overcome it .
40016019	I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatever is fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven : and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven .
40016020	Then he gave orders to the disciples to give no man word that he was the Christ .
40016021	From that time Jesus went on to make clear to his disciples how he would have to go up to Jerusalem , and undergo much at the hands of those in authority and the chief priests and scribes , and be put to death , and the third day come again from the dead .
40016022	And Peter , protesting , said to him , Be it far from you , Lord ; it is impossible that this will come about .
40016023	But he , turning to Peter , said , Get out of my way , Satan : you are a danger to me because your mind is not on the things of God , but on the things of men .
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , If any man would come after me , let him give up all , and take up his cross , and come after me .
40016025	Because whoever has a desire to keep his life safe will have it taken from him ; but whoever gives up his life because of me , will have it given back to him .
40016026	For what profit has a man , if he gets all the world with the loss of his life ? or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
40016027	For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he will give to every man the reward of his works .
40016028	Truly I say to you , There are some of those here who will not have a taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
40017001	And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter , and James , and John , his brother , and makes them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	And he was changed in form before them ; and his face was shining like the sun , and his clothing became white as light .
40017003	And Moses and Elijah came before their eyes , talking with him .
40017004	And Peter made answer and said to Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if you will let me , I will make here three tents , one for you , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah .
40017005	While he was still talking , a bright cloud came over them : and a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well pleased ; give ear to him .
40017006	And at these words the disciples went down on their faces in great fear .
40017007	And Jesus came and put his hand on them and said , Get up and have no fear .
40017008	And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , but Jesus only .
40017009	And when they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus gave them orders , saying , Let no man have word of what you have seen , till the Son of man has come again from the dead .
40017010	And his disciples , questioning him , said , Why then do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first ?
40017011	And in answer he said , Elijah truly has to come and put all things right :
40017012	But I say to you that Elijah has come , and they had no knowledge of him , but did to him whatever they were pleased to do ; the same will the Son of man undergo at their hands .
40017013	Then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of John the Baptist .
40017014	And when they came to the people , a man went down on his knees to him , saying ,
40017015	Lord have mercy on my son : for he is off his head , and is in great pain ; and frequently he goes falling into the fire , and frequently into the water .
40017016	And I took him to your disciples , and they were not able to make him well .
40017017	And Jesus , answering , said , O false and foolish generation , how long will I be with you ? how long will I put up with you ? let him come here to me .
40017018	And Jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit , and it went out of him : and the boy was made well from that hour .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus privately , and said , Why were we not able to send it out ?
40017020	And he says to them , Because of your little faith : for truly I say to you , If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , Be moved from this place to that ; and it will be moved ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
40017022	And while they were going about in Galilee , Jesus said to them , The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men ;
40017023	And they will put him to death , and the third day he will come again from the dead . And they were very sad .
40017024	And when they had come to Capernaum , those who took the Temple tax came to Peter and said , Does not your master make payment of the Temple tax ?
40017025	He says , Yes . And when he came into the house , Jesus said to him , What is your opinion , Simon ? from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax ? from their sons or from other people ?
40017026	And when he said , From other people , Jesus said to him , Then are the sons free .
40017027	But , so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them , go to the sea , and let down a hook , and take the first fish which comes up ; and in his mouth you will see a bit of money : take that , and give it to them for me and you .
40018001	In that hour the disciples came to Jesus , saying , Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
40018002	And he took a little child , and put him in the middle of them ,
40018003	And said , Truly , I say to you , If you do not have a change of heart and become like little children , you will not go into the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Whoever , then , will make himself as low as this little child , the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	And whoever gives honour to one such little child in my name , gives honour to me :
40018006	But whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me , it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck , and to come to his end in the deep sea .
40018007	A curse is on the earth because of trouble ! for it is necessary for trouble to come ; but unhappy is that man through whom the trouble comes .
40018008	And if your hand or your foot is a cause of trouble , let it be cut off and put it away from you : it is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than , having two hands or two feet , to go into the eternal fire .
40018009	And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you , take it out , and put it away from you : it is better for you to go into life with one eye than , having two eyes , to go into the hell of fire .
40018010	Let it not seem to you that one of these little ones is of no value ; for I say to you that in heaven their angels see at all times the face of my Father in heaven .
40018012	What would you say now ? if a man has a hundred sheep , and one of them has gone wandering away , will he not let the ninety-nine be , and go to the mountains in search of the wandering one ?
40018013	And if he comes across it , truly I say to you , he has more joy over it than over the ninety-nine which have not gone out of the way .
40018014	Even so it is not the pleasure of your Father in heaven for one of these little ones to come to destruction .
40018015	And if your brother does wrong to you , go , make clear to him his error between you and him in private : if he gives ear to you , you have got your brother back again .
40018016	But if he will not give ear to you , take with you one or two more , that by the lips of two or three witnesses every word may be made certain .
40018017	And if he will not give ear to them , let it come to the hearing of the church : and if he will not give ear to the church , let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax-farmer .
40018018	Truly I say to you , Whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven : and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven .
40018019	Again , I say to you , that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three are come together in my name , there am I among them .
40018021	Then Peter came and said to him , Lord , what number of times may my brother do wrong against me , and I give him forgiveness ? till seven times ?
40018022	Jesus says to him , I say not to you , Till seven times ; but , Till seventy times seven .
40018023	For this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king , who went over his accounts with his servants .
40018024	And at the start , one came to him who was in his debt for ten thousand talents .
40018025	And because he was not able to make payment , his lord gave orders for him , and his wife , and his sons and daughters , and all he had , to be given for money , and payment to be made .
40018026	So the servant went down on his face and gave him worship , saying , Lord , give me time to make payment and I will give you all .
40018027	And the lord of that servant , being moved with pity , let him go , and made him free of the debt .
40018028	But that servant went out , and meeting one of the other servants , who was in debt to him for one hundred pence , he took him by the throat , saying , Make payment of your debt .
40018029	So that servant went down on his face , requesting him and saying , Give me time and I will make payment to you .
40018030	And he would not : but went and put him into prison till he had made payment of the debt .
40018031	So when the other servants saw what was done they were very sad , and came and gave word to their lord of what had been done .
40018032	Then his lord sent for him and said , You evil servant ; I made you free of all that debt , because of your request to me :
40018033	Was it not right for you to have mercy on the other servant , even as I had mercy on you ?
40018034	And his lord was very angry , and put him in the hands of those who would give him punishment till he made payment of all the debt .
40018035	So will my Father in heaven do to you , if you do not everyone , from your hearts , give forgiveness to his brother .
40019001	And it came about that after saying these words , Jesus went away from Galilee , and came into the parts of Judaea on the other side of Jordan .
40019002	And a great number went after him ; and he made them well there .
40019003	And certain Pharisees came to him , testing him , and saying , Is it right for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
40019004	And he said in answer , Have you not seen in the Writings , that he who made them at the first made them male and female , and said ,
40019005	For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother , and be joined to his wife ; and the two will become one flesh ?
40019006	So that they are no longer two , but one flesh . Then let not that which has been joined by God be parted by man .
40019007	They say to him , Why then did Moses give orders that a husband might give her a statement in writing and be free from her ?
40019008	He says to them , Moses , because of your hard hearts , let you put away your wives : but it has not been so from the first .
40019009	And I say to you , Whoever puts away his wife for any other cause than the loss of her virtue , and takes another , is a false husband : and he who takes her as his wife when she is put away , is no true husband to her .
40019010	The disciples say to him , If this is the position of a man in relation to his wife , it is better not to be married .
40019011	But he said to them , Not all men are able to take in this saying , but only those to whom it is given .
40019012	For there are men who , from birth , were without sex : and there are some who were made so by men : and there are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven . He who is able to take it , let him take it .
40019013	Then some people took little children to him , so that he might put his hands on them in blessing : and the disciples said sharp words to them .
40019014	But Jesus said , Let the little ones come to me , and do not keep them away : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
40019015	And he put his hands on them , and went away .
40019016	And one came to him and said , Master , what good thing have I to do , so that I may have eternal life ?
40019017	And he said to him , Why are you questioning me about what is good ? One there is who is good : but if you have a desire to go into life , keep the rules of the law .
40019018	He says to him , Which ? And Jesus said , Do not put anyone to death , Do not be untrue in married life , Do not take what is not yours , Do not give false witness ,
40019019	Give honour to your father and your mother : and , Have love for your neighbour as for yourself .
40019020	The young man says to him , All these things have I done : what more is there ?
40019021	Jesus said to him , If you have a desire to be complete , go , get money for your property , and give it to the poor , and you will have wealth in heaven : and come after me .
40019022	But hearing these words the young man went away sorrowing : for he had much property .
40019023	And Jesus said to his disciples , Truly I say to you , It is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	And again I say to you , It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye , than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of God .
40019025	And the disciples , hearing this , were greatly surprised , saying , Who then may have salvation ?
40019026	And Jesus , looking at them , said , With men this is not possible ; but with God all things are possible .
40019027	Then Peter said to him , See , we have given up everything and have come after you ; what then will we have ?
40019028	And Jesus said to them , Truly I say to you that in the time when all things are made new , and the Son of man is seated in his glory , you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And everyone who has given up houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or child , or land , for my name , will be given a hundred times as much , and have eternal life .
40019030	But a great number who are first will be last , and some who are last will be first .
40020001	For the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house , who went out early in the morning to get workers into his vine-garden .
40020002	And when he had made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day , he sent them into his vine-garden .
40020003	And he went out about the third hour , and saw others in the market-place doing nothing ;
40020004	And he said to them , Go into the vine-garden with the others , and whatever is right I will give you . And they went to work .
40020005	Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour , and did the same .
40020006	And about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing ; and he says to them , Why are you here all the day doing nothing ?
40020007	They say to him , Because no man has given us work . He says to them , Go in with the rest , into the vine-garden .
40020008	And when evening came , the lord of the vine-garden said to his manager , Let the workers come , and give them their payment , from the last to the first .
40020009	And when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour , they were given every man a penny .
40020010	Then those who came first had the idea that they would get more ; and they , like the rest , were given a penny .
40020011	And when they got it , they made a protest against the master of the house ,
40020012	Saying , These last have done only one hour's work , and you have made them equal to us , who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat .
40020013	But he in answer said to one of them , Friend , I do you no wrong : did you not make an agreement with me for a penny ?
40020014	Take what is yours , and go away ; it is my pleasure to give to this last , even as to you .
40020015	Have I not the right to do as seems good to me in my house ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ?
40020016	So the last will be first , and the first last .
40020017	And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples on one side , and said to them ,
40020018	See , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes ; and they will give orders for him to be put to death ,
40020019	And will give him up to the Gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross : and the third day he will come back again from the dead .
40020020	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons , giving him worship and making a request of him .
40020021	And he said to her , What is your desire ? She says to him , Let my two sons be seated , the one at your right hand , and the other at your left , in your kingdom .
40020022	But Jesus made answer and said , You have no idea what you are requesting . Are you able to take of the cup which I am about to take ?
40020023	They say to him , We are able . He says to them , Truly , you will take of my cup : but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give , but it is for those for whom my Father has made it ready .
40020024	And when it came to the ears of the ten , they were angry with the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus said to them , You see that the rulers of the Gentiles are lords over them , and their great ones have authority over them .
40020026	Let it not be so among you : but if anyone has a desire to become great among you , let him be your servant ;
40020027	And whoever has a desire to be first among you , let him take the lowest place :
40020028	Even as the Son of man did not come to have servants , but to be a servant , and to give his life for the salvation of men .
40020029	And when they were going out from Jericho , a great number went after him .
40020030	And two blind men seated by the wayside , when they had the news that Jesus was going by , gave a loud cry , saying , Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us .
40020031	And the people gave them orders to be quiet ; but they went on crying even louder , Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us .
40020032	And Jesus , stopping , sent for them , and said , What would you have me do to you ?
40020033	They say to him , Lord , that our eyes may be open .
40020034	And Jesus , being moved with pity , put his fingers on their eyes : and straight away they were able to see , and went after him .
40021001	And when they were near Jerusalem , and had come to Beth-phage , to the Mountain of Olives , Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	Saying to them , Go into the little town in front of you , and straight away you will see an ass with a cord round her neck , and a young one with her ; let them loose and come with them to me .
40021003	And if anyone says anything to you , you will say , The Lord has need of them ; and straight away he will send them .
40021004	Now this took place so that these words of the prophet might come true ,
40021005	Say to the daughter of Zion , See , your King comes to you , gentle and seated on an ass , and on a young ass .
40021006	And the disciples went and did as Jesus had given them orders ,
40021007	And got the ass and the young one , and put their clothing on them , and he took his seat on it .
40021008	And all the people put their clothing down in the way ; and others got branches from the trees , and put them down in the way .
40021009	And those who went before him , and those who came after , gave loud cries , saying , Glory to the Son of David : A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord : Glory in the highest .
40021010	And when he came into Jerusalem , all the town was moved , saying , Who is this ?
40021011	And the people said , This is the prophet Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee .
40021012	And Jesus went into the Temple and sent out all who were trading there , overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those trading in doves .
40021013	And he said to them , It is in the Writings , My house is to be named a house of prayer , but you are making it a hole of thieves .
40021014	And the blind and the broken in body came to him in the Temple , and he made them well .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the works of power which he did , and the children crying out in the Temple , Glory to the son of David , they were angry and said to him ,
40021016	Have you any idea what these are saying ? And Jesus said to them , Yes : have you not seen in the Writings , From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete ?
40021017	And he went away from them , and went out of the town to Bethany , and was there for the night .
40021018	Now in the morning when he was coming back to the town , he had a desire for food .
40021019	And seeing a fig-tree by the wayside , he came to it , and saw nothing on it but leaves only ; and he said to it , Let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever . And straight away the fig-tree became dry and dead .
40021020	And when the disciples saw it they were surprised , saying , How did the fig-tree become dry in so short a time ?
40021021	And Jesus in answer said to them , Truly I say to you , If you have faith , without doubting , not only may you do what has been done to the fig-tree , but even if you say to this mountain , Be taken up and put into the sea , it will be done .
40021022	And all things , whatever you make request for in prayer , having faith , you will get .
40021023	And when he had come into the Temple , the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching , and said , By what authority do you do these things ? and who gave you this authority ?
40021024	And Jesus said to them in answer , I will put one question to you , and if you give me the answer , I will say by what authority I do these things .
40021025	The baptism of John , where did it come from ? from heaven or from men ? And they were reasoning among themselves , saying , If we say , From heaven ; he will say to us , Why then did you not have faith in him ?
40021026	But if we say , From men ; we are in fear of the people , because all take John to be a prophet .
40021027	And they made answer and said , We have no idea . Then he said to them , And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things .
40021028	But how does it seem to you ? A man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go and do work today in the vine-garden .
40021029	And he said in answer , I will not : but later , changing his decision , he went .
40021030	And he came to the second and said the same . And he made answer and said , I go , sir : and went not .
40021031	Which of the two did his father's pleasure ? They say , The first . Jesus said to them , Truly I say to you , that tax-farmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of God before you .
40021032	For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you had no faith in him , but the tax-farmers and the loose women had faith in him : and you , when you saw it , did not even have regret for your sins , so as to have faith in him .
40021033	Give ear to another story . A master of a house made a vine garden , and put a wall round it , and made a place for crushing out the wine , and made a tower , and let it out to field-workers , and went into another country .
40021034	And when the time for the fruit came near , he sent his servants to the workmen , to get the fruit .
40021035	And the workmen made an attack on his servants , giving blows to one , putting another to death , and stoning another .
40021036	Again , he sent other servants more in number than the first : and they did the same to them .
40021037	But after that he sent his son to them , saying , They will have respect for my son .
40021038	But when the workmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is he who will one day be the owner of the property ; come , let us put him to death and take his heritage .
40021039	And they took him and , driving him out of the vine-garden , put him to death .
40021040	When , then , the lord of the vine-garden comes , what will he do to those workmen ?
40021041	They say to him , He will put those cruel men to a cruel death , and will let out the vine-garden to other workmen , who will give him the fruit when it is ready .
40021042	Jesus says to them , Did you never see in the Writings , The stone which the builders put on one side , the same has been made the chief stone of the building : this was the Lord's doing , and it is a wonder in our eyes ?
40021043	For this reason I say to you , The kingdom of God will be taken away from you , and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it .
40021044	Any man falling on this stone will be broken , but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust .
40021045	And when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the Pharisees , they saw that he was talking of them .
40021046	And though they had a desire to take him , they were in fear of the people , because in their eyes he was a prophet .
40022001	And Jesus , talking to them again in stories , said :
40022002	The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king , who made a feast when his son was married ,
40022003	And sent out his servants to get in the guests to the feast : and they would not come .
40022004	Again he sent out other servants , with orders to say to the guests , See , I have made ready my feast : my oxen and my fat beasts have been put to death , and all things are ready : come to the feast .
40022005	But they gave no attention , and went about their business , one to his farm , another to his trade :
40022006	And the rest put violent hands on his servants , and did evil to them , and put them to death .
40022007	But the king was angry ; and he sent his armies , and those who had put his servants to death he gave to destruction , burning down their town with fire .
40022008	Then he said to his servants , The feast is ready but the guests were not good enough .
40022009	Go then to the cross-roads , and get all those whom you see to come to the bride-feast .
40022010	And those servants went out into the streets , and got together all those whom they came across , bad and good : and the feast was full of guests .
40022011	But when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who had not on a guest's robe ;
40022012	And he says to him , Friend , how came you in here not having a guest's robe ? And he had nothing to say .
40022013	Then the king said to the servants , Put cords round his hands and feet and put him out into the dark ; there will be weeping and cries of sorrow .
40022014	For out of all to whom the good news has come , only a small number will get salvation .
40022015	Then the Pharisees went and had a meeting to see how they might make use of his words to take him .
40022016	And they sent to him their disciples , with the Herodians , saying , Master , we see that you are true , and that you are teaching the true way of God , and have no fear of anyone , because you have no respect for a man's position .
40022017	Give us , then , your opinion of this : Is it right to give tax to Caesar , or not ?
40022018	But Jesus saw their trick and said , Oh false ones , why are you attempting to put me in the wrong ?
40022019	Let me see the tax money . And they gave him a penny .
40022020	And he said to them , Whose is this image and name on it ?
40022021	They say to him , Caesar's . Then he said to them , Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's , and to God the things which are God's .
40022022	And hearing it , they were full of wonder , and went away from him .
40022023	On the same day there came to him the Sadducees , who say that there is no coming back from the dead : and they put a question to him , saying ,
40022024	Master , Moses said , If a man , at the time of his death , has no children , let his brother take his wife , and get a family for his brother ;
40022025	Now there were among us seven brothers ; and the first was married and at his death , having no seed , gave his wife to his brother ;
40022026	In the same way the second and the third , up to the seventh .
40022027	And last of all the woman came to her end .
40022028	When they come back from the dead , then , whose wife will she be of the seven ? because they all had her .
40022029	But Jesus said to them in answer , You are in error , not having knowledge of the Writings , or of the power of God .
40022030	For when they come back from the dead there are no husbands and wives , but they are as the angels in heaven .
40022031	But about the dead coming back to life , have you no knowledge of what was said to you by God in the Writings :
40022032	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead but of the living .
40022033	And the people hearing it were surprised at his teaching .
40022034	But the Pharisees , hearing how the mouths of the Sadducees had been stopped , came together ;
40022035	And one of them , a teacher of the law , put a question to him , testing him , and saying ,
40022036	Master , which is the chief rule in the law ?
40022037	And he said to him , Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind .
40022038	This is the first and greatest rule .
40022039	And a second like it is this , Have love for your neighbour as for yourself .
40022040	On these two rules all the law and the prophets are based .
40022041	Now while the Pharisees were together , Jesus put a question to them , saying ,
40022042	What is your opinion of the Christ ? whose son is he ? They say to him , The Son of David .
40022043	He says to them , How then does David in the Spirit give him the name of Lord , saying ,
40022044	The Lord said to my Lord , Be seated at my right hand , till I put under your feet all those who are against you ?
40022045	If David then gives him the name of Lord , how is he his son ?
40022046	And no one was able to give him an answer , and so great was their fear of him , that from that day no one put any more questions to him .
40023001	Then Jesus said to the people and to his disciples :
40023002	The scribes and the Pharisees have the authority of Moses ;
40023003	All things , then , which they give you orders to do , these do and keep : but do not take their works as your example , for they say and do not .
40023004	They make hard laws and put great weights on men's backs ; but they themselves will not put a finger to them .
40023005	But all their works they do so as to be seen by men : for they make wide their phylacteries , and the edges of their robes ,
40023006	And the things desired by them are the first places at feasts , and the chief seats in the Synagogues ,
40023007	And words of respect in the market-places , and to be named by men , Teacher .
40023008	But you may not be named Teacher : for one is your teacher , and you are all brothers .
40023009	And give no man the name of father on earth : because one is your Father , who is in heaven .
40023010	And you may not be named guides : because one is your Guide , even Christ .
40023011	But let the greatest among you be your servant .
40023012	And whoever makes himself high will be made low , and whoever makes himself low will be made high .
40023013	But a curse is on you , scribes and Pharisees , false ones ! because you are shutting the kingdom of heaven against men : for you do not go in yourselves , and those who are going in , you keep back .
40023015	A curse is on you , scribes and Pharisees , false ones ! for you go about land and sea to get one disciple and , having him , you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves .
40023016	A curse is on you , blind guides , who say , Whoever takes an oath by the Temple , it is nothing ; but whoever takes an oath by the gold of the Temple , he is responsible .
40023017	You foolish ones and blind : which is greater , the gold , or the Temple which makes the gold holy ?
40023018	And , Whoever takes an oath by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever takes an oath by the offering which is on it , he is responsible .
40023019	You blind ones : which is greater , the offering , or the altar which makes the offering holy ?
40023020	He , then , who takes an oath by the altar , takes it by the altar and by all things on it .
40023021	And he who takes an oath by the Temple , takes it by the Temple and by him whose house it is .
40023022	And he who takes an oath by heaven , takes it by the seat of God , and by him who is seated on it .
40023023	A curse is on you , scribes and Pharisees , false ones ! for you make men give a tenth of all sorts of sweet-smelling plants , but you give no thought to the more important things of the law , righteousness , and mercy , and faith ; but it is right for you to do these , and not to let the others be undone .
40023024	You blind guides , who take out a fly from your drink , but make no trouble over a camel .
40023025	A curse is on you , scribes and Pharisees , false ones ! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the plate , but inside they are full of violent behaviour and uncontrolled desire .
40023026	You blind Pharisee , first make clean the inside of the cup and of the plate , so that the outside may become equally clean .
40023027	A curse is on you , scribes and Pharisees , false ones ! for you are like the resting-places of the dead , which are made white , and seem beautiful on the outside , but inside are full of dead men's bones and of all unclean things .
40023028	Even so you seem to men to be full of righteousness , but inside you are all false and full of wrongdoing .
40023029	A curse is on you , scribes and Pharisees , false ones ! because you put up buildings for housing the dead bodies of the prophets , and make fair the last resting-places of good men , and say ,
40023030	If we had been living in the days of our fathers , we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the prophets .
40023031	So that you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the sons of those who put the prophets to death .
40023032	Make full , then , the measure of your fathers .
40023033	You snakes , offspring of snakes , how will you be kept from the punishment of hell ?
40023034	For this reason , I send you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : some of them you will put to death and put on the cross , and to some of them you will give blows in your Synagogues , driving them from town to town ;
40023035	So that on you may come all the blood of the upright on the earth , from the blood of upright Abel to the blood of Zachariah , son of Barachiah , whom you put to death between the Temple and the altar .
40023036	Truly I say to you , All these things will come on this generation .
40023037	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , putting to death the prophets , and stoning those who are sent to her ! Again and again would I have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings , and you would not !
40023038	See , your house is made waste .
40023039	For I say to you , You will not see me from this time till you say , A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord .
40024001	And Jesus went out of the Temple , and on the way his disciples came to him , pointing out the buildings of the Temple .
40024002	But he , answering , said to them , See you not all these things ? truly I say to you that here there will not be one stone resting on another , which will not be pulled down .
40024003	And while he was seated on the Mountain of Olives , the disciples came to him privately , saying , Make clear to us , when will these things be ? and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world ?
40024004	And Jesus said to them in answer , Take care that you are not tricked .
40024005	For people will come in my name , saying , I am the Christ ; and a number will be turned from the true way through them .
40024006	And news will come to you of wars and talk of wars : do not be troubled , for these things have to be ; but it is still not the end .
40024007	For nation will be moved against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and men will be without food , and the earth will be shaking in different places ;
40024008	But all these things are the first of the troubles .
40024009	Then they will be cruel to you , and will put you to death : and you will be hated by all nations because of my name .
40024010	And numbers of people will be turned from the right way , and will give one another up and have hate for one another .
40024011	And a number of false prophets will come , causing error .
40024012	And because wrongdoing will be increased , the love of most people will become cold .
40024013	But he who goes through to the end will get salvation .
40024014	And this good news of the kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations ; and then the end will come .
40024015	When , then , you see in the holy place the unclean thing which makes destruction , of which word was given by Daniel the prophet ( let this be clear to the reader ) ,
40024016	Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains :
40024017	Let not him who is on the house-top go down to take anything out of his house :
40024018	And let not him who is in the field go back to get his coat .
40024019	But it will be hard for women who are with child and for those with babies at the breast in those days .
40024020	And say a prayer that your flight may not be in the winter , or on a Sabbath .
40024021	Because in those days there will be great sorrow , such as there has not been from the start of the world till now , or ever will be .
40024022	And if those days had not been made short there would have been no salvation for any , but because of the saints those days will be made short .
40024023	Then if any man says to you , See , here is the Christ , or , Here ; do not put faith in him ;
40024024	For there will come up false Christs , and false prophets , who will do great signs and wonders ; so that if possible even the saints might be tricked .
40024025	See , I have made it clear to you before it comes about .
40024026	If , then , they say to you , See , he is in the waste land ; go not out : See , he is in the inner rooms ; put no faith in it .
40024027	Because as in a thunderstorm the bright light coming from the east is seen even in the west ; so will be the coming of the Son of man .
40024028	Wherever the dead body is , there will the eagles come together .
40024029	But straight away , after the trouble of those days , the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light and the stars will come down from heaven and the powers of heaven will be moved :
40024030	And then the sign of the Son of man will be seen in heaven : and then all the nations of the earth will have sorrow , and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
40024031	And he will send out his angels with a great sound of a horn , and they will get his saints together from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
40024032	Now take an example from the fig-tree : when her branch has become soft and puts out its leaves , you are certain that the summer is near ;
40024033	Even so , when you see all these things , you may be certain that he is near , even at the doors .
40024034	Truly I say to you , This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete .
40024035	Heaven and earth will come to an end , but my words will not come to an end .
40024036	But of that day and hour no one has knowledge , not even the angels in heaven , or the Son , but the Father only .
40024037	And as were the days of Noah , so will be the coming of the Son of man .
40024038	Because as in those days before the overflowing of the waters , they were feasting and taking wives and getting married , till the day when Noah went into the ark ,
40024039	And they had no care till the waters came and took them all away ; so will be the coming of the Son of man .
40024040	Then two men will be in the field ; one is taken , and one let go ;
40024041	Two women will be crushing grain ; one is taken , and one let go .
40024042	Be watching , then ! for you have no knowledge on what day your Lord will come .
40024043	But be certain of this , that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming , he would have been watching , and would not have let his house be broken into .
40024044	Be ready then ; for at a time which you have no thought of the Son of man will come .
40024045	Who is the true and wise servant , whom his lord has put over those in his house , to give them their food at the right time ?
40024046	A blessing on that servant , who will be doing so when his lord comes .
40024047	Truly , I say to you , he will put him over all he has .
40024048	But if that evil servant says in his heart , My lord is a long time in coming ;
40024049	And is cruel to the other servants , taking his pleasure with those who are overcome with wine ;
40024050	The lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not looking for him , and in an hour of which he has no knowledge ,
40024051	And will have him cut in two , and will give him a part in the fate of the false ones : there will be weeping and cries of sorrow .
40025001	Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins , the friends of the bride , who took their lights , and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband .
40025002	And five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
40025003	For the foolish , when they took their lights , took no oil with them .
40025004	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights .
40025005	Now the husband was a long time in coming , and they all went to sleep .
40025006	But in the middle of the night there is a cry , The husband comes ! Go out to him .
40025007	Then all those virgins got up , and made ready their lights .
40025008	And the foolish said to the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our lights are going out .
40025009	But the wise made answer , saying , There may not be enough for us and you ; it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves .
40025010	And while they went to get oil , the master came ; and those who were ready went in with him to the feast : and the door was shut .
40025011	After that the other virgins came , saying , Lord , Lord , let us in .
40025012	But he made answer and said , Truly I say to you , I have no knowledge of you .
40025013	Keep watch , then , because you are not certain of the day or of the hour .
40025014	For it is as when a man , about to take a journey , got his servants together , and gave them his property .
40025015	And to one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to everyone as he was able ; and he went on his journey .
40025016	Straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them , and made five more .
40025017	In the same way he who had been given the two got two more .
40025018	But he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth , and kept his lord's money in a secret place .
40025019	Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes , and makes up his account with them .
40025020	And he who had the five talents came with his other five talents , saying , Lord , you gave into my care five talents : see , I have got five more .
40025021	His lord said to him , Well done , good and true servant : you have been true in a small thing , I will give you control over great things : take your part in the joy of your lord .
40025022	And he who had the two talents came and said , Lord , you gave into my care two talents : see , I have got two more .
40025023	His lord said to him , Well done , good and true servant : you have been true in a small thing , I will give you control over great things : take your part in the joy of your lord .
40025024	And he who had had the one talent came and said , Lord , I had knowledge that you are a hard man , getting in grain where you have not put seed , and making profits for which you have done no work :
40025025	And I was in fear , and went away , and put your talent in the earth : here is what is yours .
40025026	But his lord in answer said to him , You are a bad and unready servant ; if you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed , and make profits for which I have done no work ,
40025027	Why , then , did you not put my money in the bank , and at my coming I would have got back what is mine with interest ?
40025028	Take away , then , his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents .
40025029	For to everyone who has will be given , and he will have more : but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
40025030	And put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark : there will be weeping and cries of sorrow .
40025031	But when the Son of man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then will he be seated in his glory :
40025032	And before him all the nations will come together ; and they will be parted one from another , as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper .
40025033	And he will put the sheep on his right , but the goats on the left .
40025034	Then will the King say to those on his right , Come , you who have the blessing of my Father , into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was :
40025035	For I was in need of food , and you gave it to me : I was in need of drink , and you gave it to me : I was wandering , and you took me in ;
40025036	I had no clothing , and you gave it to me : when I was ill , or in prison , you came to me .
40025037	Then will the upright make answer to him , saying , Lord , when did we see you in need of food , and give it to you ? or in need of drink , and give it to you ?
40025038	And when did we see you wandering , and take you in ? or without clothing , and give it to you ?
40025039	And when did we see you ill , or in prison , and come to you ?
40025040	And the King will make answer and say to them , Truly I say to you , Because you did it to the least of these my brothers , you did it to me .
40025041	Then will he say to those on the left , Go from me , you cursed ones , into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels :
40025042	For I was in need of food , and you gave it not to me ; I was in need of drink , and you gave it not to me :
40025043	I was wandering , and you took me not in ; without clothing , and you gave me no clothing ; ill , and in prison , and you came not to me .
40025044	Then will they make answer , saying , Lord , when did we see you in need of food or drink , or wandering , or without clothing , or ill , or in prison , and did not take care of you ?
40025045	Then will he make answer to them , saying , Truly I say to you , Because you did it not to the least of these , you did it not to me .
40025046	And these will go away into eternal punishment ; but the upright into eternal life .
40026001	And when Jesus had come to the end of all these words , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	After two days is the Passover , and the Son of man will be given up to the death of the cross .
40026003	Then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest , who was named Caiaphas .
40026004	And they made designs together to take Jesus by some trick , and put him to death .
40026005	But they said , Not while the feast is going on , for fear of trouble among the people .
40026006	Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper ,
40026007	There came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price , and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table .
40026008	But when the disciples saw it they were angry , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
40026009	For we might have got much money for this and given it to the poor .
40026010	But Jesus , seeing it , said to them , Why are you troubling the woman ? she has done a kind act to me .
40026011	For the poor you have ever with you , but me you have not for ever .
40026012	For in putting this perfume on my body , she did it to make me ready for my last resting-place .
40026013	Truly I say to you , Wherever this good news goes out in all the world , what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her .
40026014	Then one of the twelve , who was named Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests and said ,
40026015	What will you give me , if I give him up to you ? And the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver .
40026016	And from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands .
40026017	Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying , Where are we to make ready for you to take the Passover meal ?
40026018	And he said to them , Go into the town to such a man , and say to him , The Master says , My time is near : I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples .
40026019	And the disciples did as Jesus had said to them ; and they made ready the Passover .
40026020	Now when evening was come , he was seated at table with the twelve disciples ;
40026021	And while they were taking food , he said , Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me .
40026022	And they were very said , and said to him , one by one , Is it I , Lord ?
40026023	And he made answer and said , He who puts his hand into the plate with me , the same will be false to me .
40026024	The Son of man goes , even as the Writings say of him : but a curse is on that man through whom the Son of man is given up ; it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world .
40026025	And Judas , who was false to him , made answer and said , Is it I , Master ? He says to him , Yes .
40026026	And when they were taking food , Jesus took bread and , after blessing it , he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said , Take it ; this is my body .
40026027	And he took a cup and , having given praise , he gave it to them , saying ,
40026028	Take of it , all of you , for this is my blood of the testament , which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	But I say to you that from now I will not take of this fruit of the vine , till that day when I take it new with you in my Father's kingdom .
40026030	And after a song of praise to God , they went out to the Mountain of Olives .
40026031	Then said Jesus to them , All of you will be turned away from me this night : for it is said in the Writings , I will put to death the keeper of the sheep , and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight .
40026032	But after I am come back from the dead , I will go before you into Galilee .
40026033	But Peter made answer and said to him , Though all may be turned away from you , I will never be turned away .
40026034	Jesus said to him , Truly I say to you that this night , before the hour of the cock's cry , you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me .
40026035	Peter says to him , Even if I am put to death with you , I will not be false to you . So said all the disciples .
40026036	Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane , and says to his disciples , Be seated here , while I go over there for prayer .
40026037	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and became sad and very troubled .
40026038	Then says he to them , My soul is very sad , even to death : keep watch with me here .
40026039	And he went forward a little , and falling down on his face in prayer , he said , O my Father , if it is possible , let this cup go from me ; but let not my pleasure , but yours be done .
40026040	And he comes to the disciples , and sees that they are sleeping , and says to Peter , What , were you not able to keep watch with me one hour ?
40026041	Keep watch with prayer , so that you may not be put to the test : the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is feeble .
40026042	Again , a second time he went away , and said in prayer , O my Father , if this may not go from me without my taking it , let your pleasure be done .
40026043	And he came again and saw them sleeping , for their eyes were tired .
40026044	And he went away from them again , and a third time said the same prayer .
40026045	Then he comes to the disciples ; and says to them , Go on sleeping now , and take your rest : for the hour is come , and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men .
40026046	Up , let us be going : see , he who gives me up is near .
40026047	And while he was still talking , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a band armed with swords and sticks , from the chief priests and those in authority over the people .
40026048	Now the false one had given them a sign saying , The one to whom I give a kiss , that is he : take him .
40026049	And straight away he came to Jesus and said , Master ! and gave him a kiss .
40026050	And Jesus said to him , Friend , do that for which you have come . Then they came and put hands on Jesus , and took him .
40026051	And one of those who were with Jesus put out his hand , and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow , cutting off his ear .
40026052	Then says Jesus to him , Put up your sword again into its place : for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword .
40026053	Does it not seem possible to you that if I make request to my Father he will even now send me an army of angels ?
40026054	But how then would the Writings come true , which say that so it has to be ?
40026055	In that hour Jesus said to the people , Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me ? I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not .
40026056	But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true . Then all his disciples went from him in flight .
40026057	And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together .
40026058	But Peter went after him at a distance , to the house of the high priest , and went in and took his seat with the servants , to see the end .
40026059	Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus , so that they might put him to death ;
40026060	And they were not able to get it , though a number of false witnesses came .
40026061	But later there came two who said , This man said , I am able to give the Temple of God to destruction , and to put it up again in three days .
40026062	And the high priest got up and said to him , Have you no answer ? what is it which these say against you ?
40026063	But Jesus said not a word . And the high priest said to him , I put you on oath , by the living God , that you will say to us if you are the Christ , the Son of God .
40026064	Jesus says to him , You say so : but I say to you , From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power , and coming on the clouds of heaven .
40026065	Then the high priest , violently parting his robes , said , He has said evil against God : what more need have we of witnesses ? for now his words against God have come to your ears :
40026066	What is your opinion ? They made answer and said , It is right for him to be put to death .
40026067	Then they put shame on him , and were cruel to him : and some gave him blows , saying ,
40026068	Be a prophet , O Christ , and say who gave you a blow !
40026069	Now Peter was seated in the open square outside the house : and a servant-girl came to him , saying , You were with Jesus the Galilaean .
40026070	But he said before them all that it was false , saying , I have no knowledge of what you say .
40026071	And when he had gone out into the doorway , another saw him and says to those who were there , This man was with Jesus the Nazarene .
40026072	And again he said with an oath , I have no knowledge of the man .
40026073	And after a little time those who were near came and said to Peter , Truly you are one of them ; because your talk is witness against you .
40026074	Then with curses and oaths he said , I have no knowledge of the man . And straight away there came the cry of a cock .
40026075	And the word of Jesus came back to Peter , when he said , Before the hour of the cock's cry , you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me . And he went out , weeping bitterly .
40027001	Now when it was morning , all the chief priests and those in authority took thought together with the purpose of putting Jesus to death .
40027002	And they put cords on him and took him away , and gave him up to Pilate , the ruler .
40027003	Then Judas , who was false to him , seeing that he was to be put to death , in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority ,
40027004	Saying , I have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man . But they said , What is that to us ? it is your business .
40027005	And he put down the silver in the Temple and went out , and put himself to death by hanging .
40027006	And the chief priests took the silver and said , It is not right to put it in the Temple store for it is the price of blood .
40027007	And they made a decision to get with the silver the potter's field , as a place for the dead of other countries .
40027008	For this cause that field was named , The field of blood , to this day .
40027009	Then came true that which was said by Jeremiah the prophet , And they took the thirty bits of silver , the price of him who was valued by the children of Israel ;
40027010	And they gave them for the potter's field , as I had word from the Lord .
40027011	And Jesus was before the ruler , who put a question to him , Are you the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said to him , You say so .
40027012	But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him , he gave no answer .
40027013	Then says Pilate to him , Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you ?
40027014	And he gave him no answer , not even a word : so that the ruler was greatly surprised .
40027015	Now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner , at their selection .
40027016	And they had then an important prisoner , whose name was Barabbas .
40027017	So when they came together , Pilate said to them , Whom will you have ? Barabbas , or Jesus , who is named Christ ?
40027018	For he saw that for envy they had given him up .
40027019	And while he was on the judge's seat , his wife sent to him , saying , Have nothing to do with that upright man , for I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him .
40027020	Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas , and for Jesus to be put to death .
40027021	But the ruler made answer and said to them , Which of the two is it your pleasure that I let go free ? And they said , Barabbas .
40027022	Pilate says to them , What , then , am I to do with Jesus , who is named Christ ? They all say , Let him be put to death on the cross .
40027023	And he said , Why , what evil has he done ? But they gave loud cries , saying , To the cross with him !
40027024	So when Pilate saw that he was able to do nothing , but that trouble was working up , he took water and , washing his hands before the people , said , The blood of this upright man is not on my hands : you are responsible .
40027025	And all the people made answer and said , Let his blood be on us , and on our children .
40027026	Then he let Barabbas go free : but after having Jesus whipped , he gave him up to be put to death on the cross .
40027027	Then the ruler's armed men took Jesus into the open square , and got all their band together .
40027028	And they took off his clothing , and put on him a red robe .
40027029	And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and put a rod in his right hand , and they went down on their knees before him , and made sport of him , saying , Long life to the King of the Jews .
40027030	And they put shame on him , and gave him blows on the head with the rod .
40027031	And when they had made sport of him , they took the robe off him , and put his clothing on him , and took him away to put him on the cross .
40027032	And while they were coming out , they saw a man of Cyrene , Simon by name , and they made him go with them , so that he might take up his cross .
40027033	And when they came to the place named Golgotha , that is to say , Dead Man's Head ,
40027034	They gave him wine mixed with bitter drink : and after tasting it , he took no more .
40027035	And when they had put him on the cross , they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance .
40027036	And they were seated there watching him .
40027037	And they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing , THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
40027038	Then two thieves were put on crosses with him , one on the right and one on the left .
40027039	And those who went by said bitter words to him , shaking their heads and saying ,
40027040	You who would give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days , get yourself free : if you are the Son of God , come down from the cross .
40027041	In the same way , the chief priests , making sport of him , with the scribes and those in authority , said ,
40027042	A saviour of others , he has no salvation for himself . If he is the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will have faith in him .
40027043	He put his faith in God ; let God be his saviour now , if he will have him ; for he said , I am the Son of God .
40027044	And the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him .
40027045	Now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour .
40027046	And about the ninth hour Jesus gave a loud cry , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is , My God , my God , why are you turned away from me ?
40027047	And some of those who were near by , hearing it , said , This man is crying to Elijah .
40027048	And straight away one of them went quickly , and took a sponge , and made it full of bitter wine , and put it on a rod and gave him drink .
40027049	And the rest said , Let him be ; let us see if Elijah will come to his help .
40027050	And Jesus gave another loud cry , and gave up his spirit .
40027051	And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end ; and there was an earth-shock ; and the rocks were broken ;
40027052	And the resting-places of the dead came open ; and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life ;
40027053	And coming out of their resting-places , after he had come again from the dead , they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people .
40027054	Now the captain and those who were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earth-shock and the things which were done , were in great fear and said , Truly this was a son of God .
40027055	And a number of women were there , watching from a distance , who had come with Jesus from Galilee , waiting on his needs .
40027056	Among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary , the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
40027057	And in the evening , there came a man of wealth from Arimathaea , Joseph by name , who was a disciple of Jesus :
40027058	This man went in to Pilate , and made a request for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate gave orders for it to be given to him .
40027059	And Joseph took the body , folding it in clean linen ,
40027060	And put it in the resting-place which had been cut out of the rock for himself ; and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away .
40027061	And Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , seated by the place of the dead .
40027062	Now on the day after the getting ready of the Passover , the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate ,
40027063	Saying , Sir , we have in mind how that false man said , while he was still living , After three days I will come again from the dead .
40027064	Give orders , then , that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day , for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people , He has come back from the dead : and the last error will be worse than the first .
40027065	Pilate said to them , You have watchmen ; go and make it as safe as you are able .
40027066	So they went , and made safe the place where his body was , putting a stamp on the stone , and the watchmen were with them .
40028001	Now late on the Sabbath , when the dawn of the first day of the week was near , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the place where his body was .
40028002	And there was a great earth-shock ; for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and , rolling back the stone , took his seat on it .
40028003	His form was shining like the light , and his clothing was white as snow :
40028004	And for fear of him the watchmen were shaking , and became as dead men .
40028005	And the angel said to the women , Have no fear : for I see that you are searching for Jesus , who was put to death on the cross .
40028006	He is not here , for he has come to life again , even as he said . Come , see the Lord's resting-place .
40028007	And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead , and is going before you into Galilee ; there you will see him , as I have said to you .
40028008	And they went away quickly , with fear and great joy , to give his disciples the news .
40028009	And on the way , Jesus came to them , saying , Be glad . And they came and put their hands on his feet , and gave him worship .
40028010	Then said Jesus to them , Have no fear : go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee , and there they will see me .
40028011	Now , while they were going , some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place .
40028012	And when they had come together with those in authority , and had made their decision , they gave much money to the watchmen , saying ,
40028013	Say , His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping .
40028014	And if this comes to the ruler's ears , we will see that he does not make you responsible .
40028015	So they took the money , and did as they had been ordered : and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time .
40028016	But the eleven disciples went into Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go .
40028017	And when they saw him they gave him worship : but some were in doubt .
40028018	And Jesus came to them and said , All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth .
40028019	Go then , and make disciples of all the nations , giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit :
40028020	Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you : and see , I am ever with you , even to the end of the world .
41001001	The first words of the good news of Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	Even as it is said in the book of Isaiah the prophet , See , I send my servant before your face , who will make ready your way ;
41001003	The voice of one crying in the waste land , Make ready the way of the Lord , make his roads straight ;
41001004	John came , and gave baptism in the waste land , preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed .
41001005	And there went out to him all the people of Judaea , and all those of Jerusalem , and they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan , saying that they were sinners .
41001006	And John was clothed in camel's hair , with a leather band about him ; and his food was locusts and honey .
41001007	And he said to them all , There is one coming after me who is greater than I , whose shoes I am not good enough to undo .
41001008	I have given you baptism with water , but he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit .
41001009	And it came about in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was given baptism by John in the Jordan .
41001010	And straight away , coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens broken open and the Spirit coming down on him as a dove :
41001011	And a voice came out of heaven , You are my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well pleased .
41001012	And straight away the Spirit sent him out into the waste land .
41001013	And he was in the waste land for forty days , being tested by Satan ; and he was with the beasts ; and the angels took care of him .
41001014	Now after John had been put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the good news of God ,
41001015	And saying , The time has come , and the kingdom of God is near : let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news .
41001016	And going by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon , and Andrew , the brother of Simon , putting a net into the sea : for they were fishermen .
41001017	And Jesus said to them , Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men .
41001018	And they went straight from their nets , and came after him .
41001019	And going on a little farther , he saw James , the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who were in their boat stitching up their nets .
41001020	And he said , Come after me : and they went away from their father Zebedee , who was in the boat with the servants , and came after him .
41001021	And they came to Capernaum ; and on the Sabbath he went into the Synagogue and gave teaching .
41001022	And they were full of wonder at his teaching , because he gave it as one having authority , and not like the scribes .
41001023	And there was in their Synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he gave a cry ,
41001024	Saying , What have we to do with you , Jesus of Nazareth ? have you come to put an end to us ? I see well who you are , the Holy One of God .
41001025	And Jesus said to him sharply , Be quiet , and come out of him .
41001026	And the unclean spirit , shaking him violently , and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
41001027	And they were all greatly surprised , so that they put questions to one another , saying , What is this ? a new teaching ! with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits , and they do what he says .
41001028	And news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of Galilee round about .
41001029	And when they came out of the Synagogue , they went into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
41001030	Now Simon's wife's mother was ill , with a burning heat ; and they gave him word of her :
41001031	And he came and took her by the hand , lifting her up ; and she became well , and took care of their needs .
41001032	And in the evening , at sundown , they took to him all who were diseased , and those who had evil spirits .
41001033	And all the town had come together at the door .
41001034	And a number , who were ill with different diseases , he made well , and sent out evil spirits ; but he did not let the evil spirits say anything , because they had knowledge of him .
41001035	And in the morning , a long time before daylight , he got up and went out to a quiet place , and there he gave himself up to prayer .
41001036	And Simon and those who were with him came after him .
41001037	And when they came up with him , they said to him , Everyone is looking for you .
41001038	And he said to them , Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns , so that I may give teaching there , because for this purpose I came .
41001039	And he went into their Synagogues in every part of Galilee , preaching and driving out evil spirits .
41001040	And a leper came to him and , going down on his knees before him , made a request , saying , If it is your pleasure , you have the power to make me clean .
41001041	And being moved with pity , he put out his hand , and touching him said to him , It is my pleasure ; be made clean .
41001042	And straight away the disease went from him , and he was made clean .
41001043	And he sent him away , saying to him very sharply ,
41001044	See that you say nothing to any man : but go and let the priest see you , and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses , for a witness to them .
41001045	But he went out , and made it public , giving an account of it everywhere , so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town , but was outside in the waste land ; and they came to him from every part .
41002001	And when he came into Capernaum again after some days , the news went about that he was in the house .
41002002	And a great number had come together , so that there was no longer room for them , no , not even about the door : and he gave them teaching .
41002003	And four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving .
41002004	And when they were unable to get near him because of all the people , they got the roof uncovered where he was : and when it was broken up , they let down the bed on which the man was .
41002005	And Jesus , seeing their faith , said to him , Son , you have forgiveness for your sins .
41002006	But there were certain of the scribes seated there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
41002007	Why does this man say such things ? he has no respect for God : from whom does forgiveness come but from God only ?
41002008	And Jesus , having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts , said to them , Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts ?
41002009	Which is the simpler , to say to a man who is ill , You have forgiveness for your sins , or , Get up , take up your bed , and go ?
41002010	But so that you may see that the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins on earth , ( he said to the man , )
41002011	I say to you , Get up , take up your bed , and go to your house .
41002012	And he got up , and straight away took up the bed and went out before them all , so that they were all full of wonder , and gave glory to God , saying , We have never seen anything like this .
41002013	And he went out again by the seaside ; and all the people came to him , and he gave them teaching .
41002014	And when he went by , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus , seated at the place where taxes were taken , and he said to him , Come with me . And he got up , and went with him .
41002015	And it came about that he was seated at meat in his house , and a number of tax-farmers and sinners were at table with Jesus and his disciples : for there were a great number of them , and they came after him .
41002016	And the scribes of the Pharisees , when they saw that he was taking food with the tax-farmers and sinners , said to his disciples , Why does he take food and drink with such men ?
41002017	And Jesus , hearing it , said to them , Those who are well have no need of a medical man , but those who are ill : I have come not to get the upright but sinners .
41002018	And John's disciples and the Pharisees were taking no food : and they came and said to him , Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees go without food , but your disciples do not ?
41002019	And Jesus said to them , Will the friends of a newly-married man go without food while he is with them ? as long as they have him with them they will not go without food .
41002020	But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them , and then they will go without food .
41002021	No man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat : or the new , by pulling away from the old , makes a worse hole .
41002022	And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins : or the skins will be burst by the wine , and the wine and the skins will be wasted : but new wine has to be put into new wine-skins .
41002023	And it came about that on the Sabbath day he was going through the grain-fields ; and while they were walking , his disciples took the heads of grain .
41002024	And the Pharisees said to him , Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath ?
41002025	And he said to them , Have you no knowledge of what David did , when he had need and was without food , he , and those who were with him ?
41002026	How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest , and took for food the holy bread , which only the priests may take , and gave it to those who were with him ?
41002027	And he said to them , The Sabbath was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath ;
41002028	So that the Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath .
41003001	And he went again into the Synagogue ; and there was a man there whose hand was dead .
41003002	And they were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath day , so that they might have something against him .
41003003	And he said to the man , Get up and come forward .
41003004	And he said to them , Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil ? to give life or to put to death ? But they said nothing .
41003005	And looking round on them he was angry , being sad because of their hard hearts ; and he said to the man , Put out your hand . And he put it out , and his hand was made well .
41003006	And the Pharisees went out , and straight away made designs with the Herodians about how they might put him to death .
41003007	And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea , and a great number from Galilee came after him : and from Judaea ,
41003008	And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and the other side of Jordan , and the country about Tyre and Sidon , a great number , hearing what great things he did , came to him .
41003009	And he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him , so that he might not be crushed by the people ;
41003010	For he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him .
41003011	And the unclean spirits , whenever they saw him , went down before him , crying out , and saying , You are the Son of God .
41003012	And he gave them special orders not to say who he was .
41003013	And he went up into the mountain , and sent for those whom it was his pleasure to have with him : and they went to him .
41003014	And he took twelve to be with him , so that he might send them out as preachers ,
41003015	And give them the power of driving out evil spirits :
41003016	To Simon he gave the second name of Peter ;
41003017	And to James , the son of Zebedee , and John , the brother of James , he gave the second name of Boanerges , which is , Sons of thunder :
41003018	And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James , the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Zealot ;
41003019	And Judas Iscariot , who was false to him .
41003020	And he went into a house . And the people came together again , so that they were not even able to take bread .
41003021	And when his friends had news of it , they went out to get him , saying , He is off his head .
41003022	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem , said , He has Beelzebub , and , By the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men .
41003023	And turning to them , he said to them in the form of a story , How is it possible for Satan to put out Satan ?
41003024	If there is division in a kingdom , that kingdom will come to destruction ;
41003025	And if there is division in a house , that house will come to destruction ;
41003026	And if Satan is at war with himself , and there is division in him , he will not keep his place but will come to an end .
41003027	But no one is able to go into the house of the strong man and take his goods , without first putting cords round the strong man , and then he will take his goods .
41003028	Truly , I say to you , The sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say :
41003029	But whoever says evil things against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness , but the evil he has done will be with him for ever :
41003030	Because they said , He has an unclean spirit .
41003031	And his mother and brothers came and were outside , and sent for him , requesting to see him .
41003032	And a great number were seated round him ; and they said to him , See , your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you .
41003033	And he said in answer , Who are my mother and my brothers ?
41003034	And looking round at those who were seated about him , he said , See , my mother and my brothers !
41003035	Whoever does God's pleasure , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
41004001	And again he was teaching by the seaside . And a very great number of people had come to him , so that he got into a boat on the sea and took his seat ; and all the people were on the land by the seaside .
41004002	And he gave them teaching about a number of things in the form of stories , and said to them in his teaching , Give ear :
41004003	A man went out to put seed in the earth :
41004004	And while he was doing it , some was dropped by the wayside , and the birds came and took it for food .
41004005	And some went on the stones , where it had not much earth ; and it came up straight away , because the earth was not deep :
41004006	And when the sun was high , it was burned ; and because it had no root , it became dry and dead .
41004007	And some went among the thorns , and the thorns came up , and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit .
41004008	And some , falling on good earth , gave fruit , coming up and increasing , and giving thirty , sixty , and a hundred times as much .
41004009	And he said to them , Whoever has ears , let him give ear .
41004010	And when he was by himself , those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories .
41004011	And he said to them , To you is given the secret of the kingdom of God , but to those who are outside , all things are given in the form of stories ;
41004012	So that seeing they may see , and it will not be clear to them ; and hearing it , they will not get the sense ; for fear that they may be turned again to me and have forgiveness .
41004013	And he said to them , If you are not clear about this story , how will you be clear about the others ?
41004014	The seed is the word .
41004015	And these are they by the wayside , where the word is planted ; and when they have given ear , the Evil One comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them .
41004016	And in the same way , these are they who are planted on the stones , who , when the word has come to their ears , straight away take it with joy ;
41004017	And they have no root in themselves , but go on for a time ; then , when trouble comes or pain , because of the word , they quickly become full of doubts .
41004018	And others are those planted among the thorns ; these are they who have given ear to the word ,
41004019	And the cares of this life , and the deceits of wealth , and the desire for other things coming in , put a stop to the growth of the word , and it gives no fruit .
41004020	And these are they who were planted on the good earth ; such as give ear to the word , and take it into their hearts , and give fruit , thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much .
41004021	And he said to them , When the light comes in , do people put it under a vessel , or under the bed , and not on its table ?
41004022	There is nothing covered which will not be seen openly , and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light .
41004023	If any man has ears , let him give ear .
41004024	And he said to them , Take care what you give ear to : in the same measure as you give you will get , and more will be given to you .
41004025	He who has , to him will be given : and he who has not , from him will be taken even that which he has .
41004026	And he said , Such is the kingdom of God , as if a man put seed in the earth ,
41004027	And went to sleep and got up , night and day , and the seed came to growth , though he had no idea how .
41004028	The earth gives fruit by herself ; first the leaf , then the head , then the full grain .
41004029	But when the grain is ready , he quickly sends men to get it cut , because the time for cutting has come .
41004030	And he said , What picture may we give of the kingdom of God , or with what story may we make it clear ?
41004031	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is put in the earth , is smaller than all the seeds on the earth ,
41004032	But when it is planted , it comes up , and becomes taller than all the plants , and puts out great branches , so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade .
41004033	And with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching , as they were able to take it :
41004034	And without a story he said nothing to them : but privately to his disciples he made all things clear .
41004035	And on that day , when the evening had come , he said to them , Let us go over to the other side .
41004036	And going away from the people , they took him with them , as he was , in the boat . And other boats were with him .
41004037	And a great storm of wind came up , and the waves came into the boat , so that the boat was now becoming full .
41004038	And he himself was in the back of the boat , sleeping on the cushion : and they , awaking him , said , Master , is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction ?
41004039	And he came out of his sleep , and gave strong orders to the wind , and said to the sea , Peace , be at rest . And the wind went down , and there was a great calm .
41004040	And he said to them , Why are you full of fear ? have you still no faith ?
41004041	And their fear was great , and they said one to another , Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea do his orders ?
41005001	And they came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gerasenes .
41005002	And when he had got out of the boat , straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit .
41005003	He was living in the place of the dead : and no man was able to keep him down , no , not with a chain ;
41005004	Because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands , and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him : and no man was strong enough to make him quiet .
41005005	And all the time , by day and by night , in the place of the dead , and in the mountains , he was crying out and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	And when he saw Jesus from far off , he went quickly to him and gave him worship ;
41005007	And crying out with a loud voice he said , What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? In God's name , do not be cruel to me .
41005008	For Jesus had said to him , Come out of the man , you unclean spirit .
41005009	And Jesus said , What is your name ? And he made answer , My name is Legion , because there are a great number of us .
41005010	And he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country .
41005011	Now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food .
41005012	And they said to him , Send us into the pigs , so that we may go into them .
41005013	And he let them do it . And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs ; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea , about two thousand of them ; and they came to their death in the sea .
41005014	And their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country . And people came to see what had taken place .
41005015	And they came to Jesus , and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated , clothed and with full use of his senses , and they were full of fear .
41005016	And those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits , and of the fate of the pigs .
41005017	And they made a request to him to go out of their country .
41005018	And when he was getting into the boat , the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him .
41005019	And he would not let him , but said to him , Go to your house , to your friends , and give them news of the great things the Lord has done for you , and how he had mercy on you .
41005020	And he went on his way , and made public in the country of Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him : and all men were full of wonder .
41005021	And when Jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side , a great number of people came to him : and he was by the sea .
41005022	And one of the rulers of the Synagogue , Jairus by name , came , and seeing him , went down at his feet ,
41005023	And made strong prayers to him , saying , My little daughter is near to death : it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her , so that she may be made well , and have life .
41005024	And he went with him ; and a great number of people went after him , and came round him .
41005025	And a woman , who had had a flow of blood for twelve years ,
41005026	And had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men , and had given all she had , and was no better , but even worse ,
41005027	When she had news of the things which Jesus did , went among the people coming after him , and put her hand on his robe .
41005028	For she said , If I may only put my hand on his robe , I will be made well .
41005029	And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped , and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well .
41005030	And straight away Jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him ; and , turning to the people , he said , Who was touching my robe ?
41005031	And his disciples said to him , You see the people round you on every side , and you say , Who was touching me ?
41005032	And on his looking round to see her who had done this thing ,
41005033	The woman , shaking with fear , conscious of what had been done to her , came and , falling on her face before him , gave him a true account of everything .
41005034	And he said to her , Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace , and be free from your disease .
41005035	And while he was still talking , they came from the ruler of the Synagogue's house , saying , Your daughter is dead : why are you still troubling the Master ?
41005036	But Jesus , giving no attention to their words , said to the ruler of the Synagogue , Have no fear , only have faith .
41005037	And he did not let anyone come with him , but Peter and James and John , the brother of James .
41005038	And they came to the house of the ruler of the Synagogue ; and he saw people running this way and that , and weeping and crying loudly .
41005039	And when he had gone in , he said to them , Why are you making such a noise and weeping ? The child is not dead , but sleeping .
41005040	And they were laughing at him . But he , having sent them all out , took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him , and went in where the child was .
41005041	And taking her by the hand , he said to her , Talitha cumi , which is , My child , I say to you , Get up .
41005042	And the young girl got up straight away , and was walking about ; she being twelve years old . And they were overcome with wonder .
41005043	And he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this ; and he said that some food was to be given to her .
41006001	And he went away from there , and came into his country ; and his disciples went with him .
41006002	And when the Sabbath day had come , he was teaching in the Synagogue ; and a number of people hearing him were surprised , saying , From where did this man get these things ? and , What is the wisdom given to this man , and what are these works of power done by his hands ?
41006003	Is not this the woodworker , the son of Mary , and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were bitter against him .
41006004	And Jesus said to them , A prophet is nowhere without honour , but in his country , and among his relations , and in his family .
41006005	And he was unable to do any work of power there , but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill , and make them well .
41006006	And he was greatly surprised because they had no faith . And he went about the country places teaching .
41006007	And he gave orders to the twelve , and sent them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits ;
41006008	And he said that they were to take nothing for their journey , but a stick only ; no bread , no bag , no money in their pockets ;
41006009	They were to go with common shoes on their feet , and not to take two coats .
41006010	And he said to them , Wherever you go into a house , make that your resting-place till you go away .
41006011	And whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you , when you go away , put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them .
41006012	And they went out , preaching the need for a change of heart in men .
41006013	And they sent out a number of evil spirits , and put oil on a great number who were ill , and made them well .
41006014	And king Herod had news of him , because his name was on the lips of all ; and he said , John the Baptist has come back from the dead , and for this reason these powers are working in him .
41006015	But others said , It is Elijah . And others said , It is a prophet , even like one of the prophets .
41006016	But Herod , when he had news of it , said , John , whom I put to death , has come back from the dead .
41006017	For Herod himself had sent men out to take John and put him in prison , because of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife , whom he had taken for himself .
41006018	For John said to Herod , It is wrong for you to have your brother's wife .
41006019	And Herodias was bitter against him , desiring to put him to death ; but she was not able ;
41006020	For Herod was in fear of John , being conscious that he was an upright and holy man , and kept him safe . And hearing him , he was much troubled ; and he gave ear to him gladly .
41006021	And the chance came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast to his lords , and the high captains , and the chief men of Galilee ;
41006022	And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and did a dance , Herod and those who were at table with him were pleased with her ; and the king said to the girl , Make a request for anything and I will give it you .
41006023	And he took an oath , saying to her , Whatever is your desire I will give it to you , even half of my kingdom .
41006024	And she went out and said to her mother , What is my request to be ? And she said , The head of John the Baptist .
41006025	And she came in quickly to the king , and said , My desire is that you give me straight away on a plate the head of John the Baptist .
41006026	And the king was very sad ; but because of his oaths , and those who were with him at table , he would not say ' No ' to her .
41006027	And straight away the king sent out one of his armed men , and gave him an order to come back with the head : and he went and took off John's head in prison ,
41006028	And came back with the head on a plate , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
41006029	And when his disciples had news of it , they came and took up his body , and put it in its last resting-place .
41006030	And the twelve came together to Jesus ; and they gave him an account of all the things they had done , and all they had been teaching .
41006031	And he said to them , Come away by yourselves to a quiet place , and take a rest for a time . Because there were a great number coming and going , and they had no time even for food .
41006032	And they went away in the boat to a waste place by themselves .
41006033	And the people saw them going , and a number of them , having knowledge who they were , went running there together on foot from all the towns , and got there before them .
41006034	And he got out , and saw a great mass of people , and he had pity on them , because they were like sheep without a keeper : and he gave them teaching about a number of things .
41006035	And at the end of the day , his disciples came to him and said , This place is waste land , and it is late :
41006036	Send them away , so that they may go into the country and small towns round about , and get some food for themselves .
41006037	But he said to them in answer , Give them food yourselves . And they said to him , Are we to go and get bread for two hundred pence , and give it to them ?
41006038	And he said to them , How much bread have you ? go and see . And when they had seen , they said , Five cakes of bread and two fishes .
41006039	And he made them all be seated in groups on the green grass .
41006040	And they were placed in groups , by hundreds and by fifties .
41006041	And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and , looking up to heaven , he said words of blessing over them ; and when the cakes were broken , he gave them to the disciples to put before the people ; and he made division of the two fishes among them all .
41006042	And they all took of the food and had enough .
41006043	And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken bits and of the fishes .
41006044	And those who took of the bread were five thousand men .
41006045	And straight away he made his disciples get into the boat , and go before him to the other side to Beth-saida , while he himself sent the people away .
41006046	And after he had sent them away , he went up into a mountain for prayer .
41006047	And by evening , the boat was in the middle of the sea , and he by himself on the land .
41006048	And seeing that they had trouble in getting their boat through the water , because the wind was against them , about the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea ; and he would have gone past them ;
41006049	But they , when they saw him walking on the sea , took him for a spirit , and gave a loud cry :
41006050	For they all saw him , and were troubled . But straight away he said to them , Take heart , it is I , have no fear .
41006051	And he went to them into the boat , and the wind went down , and they were full of wonder in themselves ;
41006052	For it was not clear to them about the bread ; but their hearts were hard .
41006053	And when they had gone across , they came to Gennesaret , and got their boat to land .
41006054	And when they had got out of the boat , the people quickly had news of him ,
41006055	And went running through all the country round about , and took on their beds those who were ill , to where it was said that he was .
41006056	And wherever he went , into small towns , or great towns , or into the country , they took those who were ill into the market-places , requesting him that they might put their hands even on the edge of his robe : and all those who did so were made well .
41007001	And there came together to him the Pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem ,
41007002	And had seen that some of his disciples took their bread with unclean , that is , unwashed , hands .
41007003	Now the Pharisees , and all the Jews , do not take food without washing their hands with care , keeping the old rule which has been handed down to them :
41007004	And when they come from the market-place , they take no food till their hands are washed ; and a number of other orders there are , which have been handed down to them to keep--washings of cups and pots and brass vessels .
41007005	And the Pharisees and the scribes put the question to him , Why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers , but take their bread with unwashed hands ?
41007006	And he said , Well did Isaiah say of you , you false ones : These people give me honour with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
41007007	But their worship is to no purpose , while they give as their teaching the rules of men .
41007008	For , turning away from the law of God , you keep the rules of men .
41007009	And he said to them , Truly you put on one side the law of God , so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you .
41007010	For Moses said , Give honour to your father and mother , and , He who says evil of father or mother , let him have the punishment of death :
41007011	But you say , If a man says to his father or his mother , That by which you might have had profit from me is Corban , that is to say , Given to God ,
41007012	You no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother ;
41007013	Making the word of God of no effect by your rule , which you have given : and a number of other such things you do .
41007014	And turning to the people again , he said to them , Give ear to me all of you , and let my words be clear to you :
41007015	There is nothing outside the man which , going into him , is able to make him unclean : but the things which come out of the man are those which make the man unclean .
41007017	And when he had gone into the house away from all the people , his disciples put questions to him about the saying .
41007018	And he said to them , Have even you so little wisdom ? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean ,
41007019	Because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach , and goes out with the waste ? He said this , making all food clean .
41007020	And he said , That which comes out of the man , that makes the man unclean .
41007021	Because from inside , from the heart of men , come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures ,
41007022	The taking of goods and of life , broken faith between husband and wife , the desire of wealth , wrongdoing , deceit , sins of the flesh , an evil eye , angry words , pride , foolish acts :
41007023	All these evil things come from inside , and make the man unclean .
41007024	And he went away from there to the country of Tyre and Sidon . And he went into a house , desiring that no man might have knowledge of it : and he was not able to keep it secret .
41007025	But a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having had news of him , came straight away and went down at his feet .
41007026	Now the woman was a Greek , a Syro-phoenician by birth : and she made a request to him that he would send the evil spirit out of her daughter .
41007027	And he said to her , Let the children first have their food : for it is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs .
41007028	But she said to him in answer , Yes , Lord : even the dogs under the table take the bits dropped by the children .
41007029	And he said to her , For this saying go your way ; the evil spirit has gone out of your daughter .
41007030	And she went away to her house , and saw the child on the bed , and the evil spirit gone out .
41007031	And again he went out from Tyre , and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee , through the country of Decapolis .
41007032	And they came to him with one who had no power of hearing and had trouble in talking ; and they made a request to him to put his hands on him .
41007033	And he took him on one side from the people privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he put water from his mouth on the man's tongue with his finger ;
41007034	And looking up to heaven , he took a deep breath , and said to him , Ephphatha , that is , Be open .
41007035	And his ears became open , and the band of his tongue was made loose , and his words became clear .
41007036	And he gave them orders not to give news of it to anyone ; but the more he made this request , so much the more they made it public .
41007037	And they were overcome with wonder , saying , He has done all things well : he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them .
41008001	In those days again , when there was a great mass of people and they had no food , he made his disciples come to him and said to them ,
41008002	I have pity for these people because they have been with me now three days , and have no food ;
41008003	If I send them away to their houses with no food , they will be overcome by weariness on the way ; and some of them have come from far .
41008004	And his disciples said in answer , How will it be possible to get enough bread for these men here in a waste place ?
41008005	And he put the question , How much bread have you ? And they said , Seven cakes .
41008006	And he made the people be seated on the earth : and he took the seven cakes and , having given praise , he gave the broken bread to his disciples to put before them ; and they put it before the people .
41008007	And they had some small fishes ; and blessing them he had them put before the people in the same way .
41008008	And they took the food , and had enough ; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken bits .
41008009	And there were about four thousand people : and he sent them away .
41008010	And he got into the boat with his disciples straight away , and came into the country of Dalmanutha .
41008011	And the Pharisees came out and put questions to him , requesting from him a sign from heaven , testing him .
41008012	And he was very sad in spirit , and said , Why is this generation looking for a sign ? truly , I say to you , No sign will be given to this generation .
41008013	And he went away from them , and again got into the boat and went across to the other side .
41008014	And they had taken no thought to get bread ; and they had only one cake of bread with them in the boat .
41008015	And he said to them , Take care to be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod .
41008016	And they said to one another , We have no bread .
41008017	And Jesus , hearing it , said to them , Why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread ? do you still not see , and is it still not clear to you ? are your hearts so hard ?
41008018	Having eyes , do you not see ? and having ears , have you no hearing ? and have you no memory ?
41008019	When I made a division of the five cakes of bread among the five thousand , what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up ? They said to him , Twelve .
41008020	And when the seven among the four thousand , what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up ? And they said to him , Seven .
41008021	And he said to them , Is it still not clear to you ?
41008022	And they came to Beth-saida . And they took a blind man to him , requesting him to put his hands on him .
41008023	And he took the blind man by the hand , and went with him out of the town ; and when he had put water from his mouth on his eyes , and put his hands on him , he said , Do you see anything ?
41008024	And looking up , he said , I see men ; I see them like trees , walking .
41008025	Then again he put his hands on his eyes ; and looking hard , he was able to see , and saw all things clearly .
41008026	And he sent him away to his house , saying , Do not even go into the town .
41008027	And Jesus went out , with his disciples , into the little towns round Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way he put a question to his disciples , saying , Who do men say that I am ?
41008028	And they made answer , John the Baptist ; and others , Elijah ; but others , One of the prophets .
41008029	And he said to them , But who do you say I am ? Peter said in answer , You are the Christ .
41008030	And he put them under orders not to say this of him to anyone .
41008031	And teaching them , he said that the Son of man would have to undergo much , and be hated by those in authority , and the chief priests , and the scribes , and be put to death , and after three days come back from the dead .
41008032	And he said this openly . And Peter took him , and was protesting .
41008033	But he , turning about , and seeing his disciples , said sharply to Peter , Get out of my way , Satan : for your mind is not on the things of God , but on the things of men .
41008034	And turning to the mass of people with his disciples , he said to them , If any man has the desire to come after me , let him give up all other desires , and take up his cross and come after me .
41008035	Whoever has a desire to keep his life , will have it taken from him ; and whoever gives up his life because of me and the good news , will keep it .
41008036	What profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life ?
41008037	And what would a man give in exchange for his life ?
41008038	Whoever has a feeling of shame because of me and my words in this false and evil generation , the Son of man will have a feeling of shame because of him , when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
41009001	And he said to them , Truly I say to you , There are some here who will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God come with power .
41009002	And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John , and made them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves : and he was changed in form before them :
41009003	And his clothing became shining , very white , as no cleaner on earth would make it .
41009004	And there came before them Elijah with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
41009005	And Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tents ; one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah .
41009006	Because he was not certain what to say , for they were in great fear .
41009007	And a cloud came over them ; and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my dearly loved Son , give ear to him .
41009008	And suddenly looking round about , they saw no one any longer , but Jesus only with themselves .
41009009	And while they were coming down from the mountain , he gave them orders not to give word to any man of the things they had seen , till the Son of man had come back from the dead .
41009010	And they kept the saying , questioning among themselves what the coming back from the dead might be .
41009011	And they put a question to him , saying , Why do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first ?
41009012	And he said to them , Truly , Elijah does come first , and puts all things in order ; and how is it said in the Writings that the Son of man will go through much sorrow and be made as nothing ?
41009013	But I say to you that Elijah has come , and they have done to him whatever they were pleased to do , even as the Writings say about him .
41009014	And when they came to the disciples , they saw a great mass of people about them , and scribes questioning them .
41009015	And straight away all the people , when they saw him , were full of wonder , and running to him , gave him worship .
41009016	And he said , What are you questioning them about ?
41009017	And one of the number said to him in answer , Master , I came to you with my son , who has in him a spirit which takes away his power of talking ;
41009018	And wherever it takes him , it puts him down violently , streaming at the lips and twisted with pain ; and his strength goes from him ; and I made a request to your disciples to send it out , and they were not able .
41009019	And he said to them in answer , O generation without faith , how long will I have to be with you ? how long will I put up with you ? let him come to me .
41009020	And they took him to him : and when he saw him , the spirit in him straight away became violent ; and he went down on the earth , rolling about and streaming at the lips .
41009021	And Jesus questioning the father said , How long has he been like this ? And he said , From a child .
41009022	And frequently it has sent him into the fire and into the water , for his destruction ; but if you are able to do anything , have pity on us , and give us help .
41009023	And Jesus said to him , If you are able ! All things are possible to him who has faith .
41009024	Straight away the father of the child gave a cry , saying , I have faith ; make my feeble faith stronger .
41009025	And when Jesus saw that the people came running together , he gave orders to the unclean spirit , saying to him , You , spirit , who are the cause of his loss of voice and hearing , I say to you , come out of him , and never again go into him .
41009026	And after crying out and shaking him violently , it came out : and the child became like one dead ; so that most of them said , He is dead .
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand , lifting him up ; and he got up .
41009028	And when he had gone into the house , his disciples said to him privately , Why were we unable to send it out ?
41009029	And he said to them , Nothing will make this sort come out but prayer .
41009030	And they went out from there , through Galilee ; and it was his desire that no man might have knowledge of it ;
41009031	For he was giving his disciples teaching , and saying to them , The Son of man is given up into the hands of men , and they will put him to death ; and when he is dead , after three days he will come back from the dead .
41009032	But the saying was not clear to them , and they were in fear of questioning him about it .
41009033	And they came to Capernaum : and when he was in the house , he put the question to them , What were you talking about on the way ?
41009034	But they said nothing : because they had had an argument between themselves on the way , about who was the greatest .
41009035	And seating himself , he made the twelve come to him ; and he said to them , If any man has the desire to be first , he will be last of all and servant of all .
41009036	And he took a little child , and put him in the middle of them ; and taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
41009037	Whoever will give honour to one such little child in my name , gives honour to me : and whoever gives honour to me , gives honour not to me , but to him who sent me .
41009038	John said to him , Master , we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name : and we said that he might not , because he is not one of us .
41009039	But Jesus said , Say not so : for there is no man who will do a great work in my name , and be able at the same time to say evil of me .
41009040	He who is not against us is for us .
41009041	Whoever gives you a cup of water , because you are Christ's , truly I say to you , he will in no way be without his reward .
41009042	And whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me , it would be better for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea .
41009043	And if your hand is a cause of trouble to you , let it be cut off ; it is better for you to go into life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell , into the eternal fire .
41009045	And if your foot is a cause of trouble to you , let it be cut off : it is better for you to go into life with one foot than to have two feet and go into hell .
41009047	And if your eye is a cause of trouble to you , take it out : it is better for you to go into the kingdom of God with one eye than , having two eyes , to go into hell ,
41009048	Where their worm is ever living and the fire is not put out .
41009049	Everyone will be salted with fire .
41009050	Salt is good ; but if the taste goes from it , how will you make it salt again ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace one with another .
41010001	And he got up , and went into the country of Judaea on the other side of Jordan : and great numbers of people came together to him again ; and , as was his way , he gave them teaching .
41010002	And Pharisees came to him , testing him with the question , Is it right for a man to put away his wife ?
41010003	And he said to them in answer , What did Moses say you were to do ?
41010004	And they said to him , Moses let us give her a statement in writing , and be free from her .
41010005	But Jesus said to them , Because of your hard hearts he gave you this law .
41010006	But from the first , male and female made he them .
41010007	For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother , and be joined to his wife ;
41010008	And the two will become one flesh ; so that they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	Let not that which has been joined together by God be parted by man .
41010010	And in the house the disciples put questions to him again about this thing .
41010011	And he said to them , Whoever puts away his wife and takes another , is false to his wife ;
41010012	And if she herself puts away her husband and takes another , she is false to her husband .
41010013	And they took to him little children , so that he might put his hands on them : and the disciples said sharp words to them .
41010014	And when Jesus saw it , he was angry , and said to them , Let the little children come to me , and do not keep them away ; for of such is the kingdom of God .
41010015	Truly I say to you , Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child , will not come into it at all .
41010016	And he took them in his arms , and gave them a blessing , putting his hands on them .
41010017	And while he was going out into the way , a man came running to him , and went down on his knees , saying , Good Master , what have I to do so that I may have eternal life ?
41010018	And Jesus said to him , Why do you say I am good ? no one is good but one , and that is God .
41010019	You have knowledge of what is said in the law , Do not put any one to death , Do not be untrue in married life , Do not take what is not yours , Do not give false witness , Do not get money by deceit , Give honour to your father and mother .
41010020	And he said to him , Master , all these laws I have kept from the time when I was young .
41010021	And Jesus , looking on him and loving him , said , There is one thing needed : go , get money for your goods , and give it to the poor , and you will have wealth in heaven : and come with me .
41010022	But his face became sad at the saying , and he went away sorrowing : for he was one who had much property .
41010023	And Jesus , looking round about , said to his disciples , How hard it is for those who have wealth to come into the kingdom of God !
41010024	And the disciples were full of wonder at his words . But Jesus said to them again , Children , how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is simpler for a camel to go through a needle's eye , than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of God .
41010026	And they were greatly surprised , saying to him , Who then may have salvation ?
41010027	Jesus , looking on them , said , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for all things are possible with God .
41010028	Peter said to him , See , we have given up everything , and come after you .
41010029	Jesus said , Truly I say to you , There is no man who has given up house , or brothers , or sisters , or mother , or father , or children , or land , because of me and the good news ,
41010030	Who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time , houses , and brothers , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and land--though with great troubles ; and , in the world to come , eternal life .
41010031	But a great number who are first will be last : and those who are last will be first .
41010032	And they were on the way , going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus was going before them : and they were full of wonder ; but those who came after him were in fear . And again he took the twelve , and gave them word of the things which were to come on him ,
41010033	Saying , See , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man will be given up to the chief priests and the scribes ; and they will give an order for his death , and will give him up to the Gentiles :
41010034	And they will make sport of him , and put shame on him , and give him cruel blows , and will put him to death ; and after three days he will come back from the dead .
41010035	And there came to him James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying to him , Master , will you give us whatever may be our request ?
41010036	And he said to them , What would you have me do for you ?
41010037	And they said to him , Let us be seated , one at your right hand and one at your left , in your glory .
41010038	But Jesus said to them , You have no knowledge of what you are saying . Are you able to take of my cup ? or to undergo the baptism which I am to undergo ?
41010039	And they said to him , We are able . And Jesus said to them , You will take of the cup from which I take ; and the baptism which I am about to undergo you will undergo :
41010040	But to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give : but it is for those for whom it has been made ready .
41010041	And hearing this , the ten became very angry with James and John .
41010042	And Jesus made them come to him , and said to them , You see that those who are made rulers over the Gentiles are lords over them , and their great ones have authority over them .
41010043	But it is not so among you : but whoever has a desire to become great among you , let him be your servant :
41010044	And whoever has a desire to be first among you , let him be servant of all .
41010045	For truly the Son of man did not come to have servants , but to be a servant , and to give his life for the salvation of men .
41010046	And they came to Jericho : and when he was going out of Jericho , with his disciples and a great number of people , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , a blind man , was seated by the wayside , with his hand out for money .
41010047	And when it came to his ears that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he gave a cry , and said , Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me .
41010048	And some of them , turning in protest , gave him an order to be quiet : but he went on crying out all the more , Son of David , have mercy on me .
41010049	And Jesus came to a stop and said , Let him come . And crying out to the blind man , they said to him , Be comforted : come , he has sent for you .
41010050	And he , putting off his coat , got up quickly , and came to Jesus .
41010051	And Jesus said to him , What would you have me do to you ? And the blind man said , Master , make me able to see .
41010052	And Jesus said to him , Go on your way ; your faith has made you well . And straight away he was able to see , and went after him in the way .
41011001	And when they came near to Jerusalem , to Beth-phage and Bethany , at the Mountain of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
41011002	And said to them , Go into the little town opposite : and when you come to it , you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck , on which no man has ever been seated ; let him loose , and come back with him .
41011003	And if anyone says to you , Why are you doing this ? say , The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away .
41011004	And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street ; and they were getting him loose .
41011005	And some of those who were there said to them , What are you doing , taking the ass ?
41011006	And they said to them the words which Jesus had said ; and they let them go .
41011007	And they took the young ass to Jesus , and put their clothing on him , and he got on his back .
41011008	And a great number put down their clothing in the way ; and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields .
41011009	And those who went in front , and those who came after , were crying , Glory : A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord :
41011010	A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David : Glory in the highest .
41011011	And he went into Jerusalem into the Temple ; and after looking round about on all things , it being now evening , he went out to Bethany with the twelve .
41011012	And on the day after , when they had come out from Bethany , he was in need of food .
41011013	And seeing a fig-tree in the distance with leaves , he went to see if by chance it had anything on it : and when he came to it , he saw nothing but leaves , for it was not the time for the fruit .
41011014	And he said to it , Let no man take fruit from you for ever . And his disciples took note of his words .
41011015	And they came to Jerusalem ; and he went into the Temple , and sent out those who were trading there , overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money ;
41011016	And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple .
41011017	And he gave them teaching , and said to them , Is it not in the Writings , My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations ? but you have made it a hole of thieves .
41011018	And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes , and they took thought how they might put him to death ; being in fear of him , because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching .
41011019	And every evening he went out of the town .
41011020	And when they were going by in the morning , they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots .
41011021	And Peter , having a memory of it , said to him , Master , see , the tree which was cursed by you is dead .
41011022	And Jesus , answering , said to them , Have God's faith .
41011023	Truly I say to you , Whoever says to this mountain , Be taken up and be put into the sea ; and has no doubt in his heart , but has faith that what he says will come about , he will have his desire .
41011024	For this reason I say to you , Whatever you make a request for in prayer , have faith that it has been given to you , and you will have it .
41011025	And whenever you make a prayer , let there be forgiveness in your hearts , if you have anything against anyone ; so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your Father who is in heaven .
41011027	And they came again to Jerusalem : and while he was walking in the Temple , there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority :
41011028	And they said to him , By what authority do you do these things ? or who gave you authority to do these things ?
41011029	And Jesus said to them , I will put to you one question ; give me an answer , and I will say by what authority I do these things .
41011030	The baptism of John , was it from heaven or from men ? give me an answer .
41011031	And they gave thought to it among themselves , saying , If we say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did you not have faith in him ?
41011032	But if we say , From men--they were in fear of the people , because all took John to be truly a prophet .
41011033	And they said in answer to Jesus , We have no idea . And Jesus said to them , And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things .
41012001	And he gave them teaching in the form of stories . A man had a vine-garden planted , and put a wall about it , and made a place for crushing out the wine , and put up a tower , and let it out to field-workers , and went into another country .
41012002	And when the time came , he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden .
41012003	And they took him , and gave him blows , and sent him away with nothing .
41012004	And again he sent to them another servant ; and they gave him wounds on the head , and were very cruel to him .
41012005	And he sent another ; and they put him to death : and a number of others , whipping some , and putting some to death .
41012006	He still had one , a dearly loved son : he sent him last to them , saying , They will have respect for my son .
41012007	But those workmen said among themselves , This is he who will one day be the owner of the property ; come , let us put him to death , and the heritage will be ours .
41012008	And they took him and put him to death , pushing his body out of the garden .
41012009	What then will the master of the garden do ? He will come and put the workmen to death , and will give the garden into the hands of others .
41012010	Have you not seen this which is in the Writings : The stone which the builders put on one side , the same was made the chief stone of the building :
41012011	This was the Lord's doing , and it is a wonder in our eyes ?
41012012	And they made attempts to take him ; but they were in fear of the people , because they saw that the story was against them ; and they went away from him .
41012013	Then they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and the Herodians , so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick .
41012014	And when they had come , they said to him , Master , we are certain that you are true , and have no fear of anyone : you have no respect for a man's position , but you are teaching the true way of God : Is it right to give taxes to Caesar or not ?
41012015	Are we to give or not to give ? But he , conscious of their false hearts , said to them , Why do you put me to the test ? give me a penny , so that I may see it .
41012016	And they gave him one . And he said to them , Whose is this image and name on it ? And they said to him , Caesar's .
41012017	And Jesus said to them , Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's , and to God the things which are God's . And they were full of wonder at him .
41012018	And there came to him Sadducees , who say there is no coming back from the dead ; and they put a question to him , saying ,
41012019	Master , in the law Moses says , If a man's brother comes to his end , and has a wife still living and no child , it is right for his brother to take his wife , and get a family for his brother .
41012020	There were seven brothers : and the first took a wife , and at his death there were no offspring ;
41012021	And the second took her , and at his death there were no offspring ; and the third the same :
41012022	And all the seven had no seed . Last of all the woman herself came to her death .
41012023	In the future life , when they come back from the dead , whose wife will she be ? for the seven had her for a wife .
41012024	Jesus said to them , Is not this the reason for your error , that you have no knowledge of the holy Writings or of the power of God ?
41012025	When they come back from the dead , they do not get married , but are like the angels in heaven .
41012026	But as to the dead coming back to life ; have you not seen in the book of Moses , about the burning thorn-tree , how God said to him , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
41012027	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living : you are greatly in error .
41012028	And one of the scribes came , and hearing their argument together , and seeing that he had given them a good answer , put the question to him , Which law is the first of all ?
41012029	Jesus said in answer , The first is , Give ear , O Israel : The Lord our God is one Lord ;
41012030	And you are to have love for the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength .
41012031	The second is this , Have love for your neighbour as for yourself . There is no other law greater than these .
41012032	And the scribe said to him , Truly , Master , you have well said that he is one , and there is no other but he :
41012033	And to have love for him with all the heart , and with all the mind , and with all the strength , and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself , is much more than all forms of offerings .
41012034	And when Jesus saw that he gave a wise answer , he said to him , You are not far from the kingdom of God . And every man after that was in fear of questioning him any more .
41012035	And Jesus , when he was teaching in the Temple , said , How do the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
41012036	David himself said in the Holy Spirit , The Lord said to my Lord , Be seated at my right hand , till I put those who are against you under your feet .
41012037	David himself gives him the name of Lord ; and how then is he his son ? And the common people gave ear to him gladly .
41012038	And in his teaching he said , Be on your watch against the scribes , whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and be respected in the market-places ,
41012039	And to have the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts ;
41012040	Who take away the property of widows , and before the eyes of men make long prayers ; these will be judged more hardly .
41012041	And he took a seat by the place where the money was kept , and saw how the people put money into the boxes : and a number who had wealth put in much .
41012042	And there came a poor widow , and she put in two little bits of money , which make a farthing .
41012043	And he made his disciples come to him , and said to them , Truly I say to you , This poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting money into the box :
41012044	Because they all put in something out of what they had no need for ; but she out of her need put in all she had , even all her living .
41013001	And when he was going out of the Temple , one of his disciples said to him , Master , see , what stones and what buildings !
41013002	And Jesus said to him , Do you see these great buildings ? there is not one stone here resting on another which will not be overturned .
41013003	And while he was seated on the Mountain of Olives opposite the Temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew said to him privately ,
41013004	Say when these things will be , and what will be the sign when these things are all about to be done .
41013005	And Jesus said to them , Take care that you are not tricked by anyone .
41013006	People will come in my name , saying , I am he ; and a number will be turned from the true way .
41013007	And when you have news of wars and talk of wars , do not be troubled ; these things have to be , but it is still not the end .
41013008	Nation will go to war with nation , and kingdom with kingdom : there will be earth-shocks in different places ; there will be times when there is no food ; these things are the first of the troubles .
41013009	But take care : for they will give you up to the Sanhedrins ; and in Synagogues you will be whipped ; and you will be taken before rulers and kings because of me , for a sign to them .
41013010	And the good news has first to be given to all the nations .
41013011	And when you are taken and given up to be judged , do not be troubled about what to say : but whatever is given to you in that hour , say : because it is not you who say it , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	And brother will give up brother to death , and the father his child ; and children will go against their fathers and mothers , and put them to death .
41013013	And you will be hated by all men , because of my name ; but he who goes through to the end will have salvation .
41013014	But when you see the unclean thing which makes destruction , in the place where it has no right to be ( let this be clear to the reader ) , then let those who are in Judaea go quickly to the mountains :
41013015	And let him who is on the house-top not go down , or go in , to take anything out of his house :
41013016	And let not him who is in the field go back to take his coat .
41013017	And it will be hard for women who are with child and for her who has a baby at the breast in those days .
41013018	And say a prayer that it may not be in the winter .
41013019	For in those days there will be sorrow , such as there has not been from the time when God made the world till now , and will not ever be again .
41013020	And if the Lord had not made the time short , no flesh would have been kept from destruction ; but because of the saints he has made the time short .
41013021	And then if any man says to you , See , here is Christ ; or , See , there ; have no faith in it :
41013022	Because there will be false Christs and false prophets , and they will give signs and wonders in the hope of turning even the saints from the true way .
41013023	But take care ; see , I have made all things clear to you before the time .
41013024	But in those days , after that time of trouble , the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light ,
41013025	And the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers which are in the heavens will be moved .
41013026	And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	And then he will send out the angels , and will get together his saints from the four winds , from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven .
41013028	Take an example from the fig-tree : when its branches become soft and put out their leaves , you see that the summer is near ;
41013029	Even so , when you see these things taking place , you may be certain that he is near , even at the doors .
41013030	Truly , I say to you , This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete .
41013031	Heaven and earth will come to an end , but my words will not come to an end .
41013032	But of that day or that hour no one has knowledge , not even the angels in heaven , or the Son , but the Father .
41013033	Take care , keep watch with prayer : for you are not certain when the time will be .
41013034	It is as when a man who is in another country for a time , having gone away from his house , and given authority to his servants and to everyone his work , gives the porter an order to keep watch .
41013035	So you are to keep watch : because you are not certain when the master of the house is coming , in the evening , or in the middle of the night , or at the cock's cry , or in the morning ;
41013036	For fear that , coming suddenly , he sees you sleeping .
41013037	And what I say to you , I say to all , Keep watch .
41014001	It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes made designs how they might take him by deceit and put him to death :
41014002	But they said , Not while the feast is going on , for fear there may be trouble among the people .
41014003	And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , seated at table , there came a woman with a bottle of perfumed oil of great price ; and when the bottle was broken she put the perfume on his head .
41014004	But some of them were angry among themselves , saying , For what purpose has this oil been wasted ?
41014005	We might have got more than three hundred pence for it , and given the money to the poor . And they said things against her among themselves .
41014006	But Jesus said , Let her be ; why are you troubling her ? she has done a kind act to me .
41014007	The poor you have ever with you , and whenever you have the desire you may do them good : but me you have not for ever .
41014008	She has done what she was able : she has put oil on my body to make it ready for its last resting-place .
41014009	And truly I say to you , Wherever the good news goes out through all the earth , what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her .
41014010	And Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , so that he might give him up to them .
41014011	And hearing what he said , they were glad , and gave him their word to make him a payment of money . And he took thought how he might best give him up to them .
41014012	And on the first day of unleavened bread , when the Passover lamb is put to death , his disciples said to him , Where are we to go and make ready for you to take the Passover meal ?
41014013	And he sent two of his disciples , and said to them , Go into the town , and there will come to you a man with a vessel of water : go after him ;
41014014	And wherever he goes in , say to the owner of the house , The Master says , Where is my guest-room , where I may take the Passover with my disciples ?
41014015	And he will take you up himself to a great room with a table and seats : there make ready for us .
41014016	And the disciples went out and came into the town , and saw that it was as he had said : and they made ready the Passover .
41014017	And when it was evening he came with the twelve .
41014018	And while they were seated taking food , Jesus said , Truly I say to you , One of you will be false to me , one who is taking food with me .
41014019	They were sad , and said to him one by one , Is it I ?
41014020	And he said to them , It is one of the twelve , one who is putting his bread with me into the same plate .
41014021	The Son of man goes , even as the Writings say of him : but cursed is that man through whom the Son of man is given up ! It would have been well for that man if he had never been given birth .
41014022	And while they were taking food , he took bread , and after blessing it , he gave the broken bread to them , and said , Take it : this is my body .
41014023	And he took a cup , and when he had given praise , he gave it to them : and they all had a drink from it .
41014024	And he said to them , This is my blood of the testament , which is given for men .
41014025	Truly I say to you , I will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when I take it new in the kingdom of God .
41014026	And after a song of praise to God they went out to the Mountain of Olives .
41014027	And Jesus said to them , You will all be turned away from me : for it is in the Writings , I will put the keeper of the sheep to death , and the sheep will be put to flight .
41014028	But after I have come back from the dead , I will go before you into Galilee .
41014029	But Peter said to him , Though the others may be turned away from you , I will not .
41014030	And Jesus said to him , Truly , I say to you that you , today , even this night , before the cock's second cry , will say three times that you have no knowledge of me .
41014031	But he said with passion , If I have to be put to death with you , I will not be false to you . And they all said the same .
41014032	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he said to his disciples , Be seated here while I say a prayer .
41014033	And he took with him Peter and James and John , and grief and great trouble came on him .
41014034	And he said to them , My soul is very sad , even to death : be here a little time , and keep watch .
41014035	And he went forward a little , and falling down on the earth , made request that , if possible , the hour might go from him .
41014036	And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible to you ; take away this cup from me : but even so let not my pleasure , but yours be done .
41014037	And he came , and saw them sleeping , and said to Peter , Simon , are you sleeping ? were you not able to keep watch one hour ?
41014038	Keep watch with prayer , so that you may not be put to the test ; the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is feeble .
41014039	And again he went away , and said a prayer , using the same words .
41014040	And again he came and saw them sleeping , because their eyes were very tired ; and they had nothing to say in answer .
41014041	And he came the third time , and said to them , Go on sleeping now and take your rest : it is enough ; the hour has come ; see , the Son of man is given up into the hands of evil men .
41014042	Get up , let us be going ; see , he who gives me up is near .
41014043	And straight away , while he was still talking , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great band with swords and sticks , from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority .
41014044	Now he who had been false to him had given them a sign , saying , The one to whom I give a kiss , that is he ; take him , and get him away safely .
41014045	And when he had come , he went straight to him and said , Master ; and gave him a kiss .
41014046	And they put their hands on him , and took him .
41014047	But a certain one of those who were near took out his sword , and gave the servant of the high priest a blow , cutting off his ear .
41014048	And Jesus said to them , Have you come out as against a thief , with swords and sticks to take me ?
41014049	I was with you every day in the Temple teaching , and you did not take me ; but this is done so that the Writings may come true .
41014050	And they all went away from him in fear .
41014051	And a certain young man went after him , with only a linen cloth about his body ; and they put their hands on him ;
41014052	But he got away unclothed , without the linen cloth .
41014053	And they took Jesus away to the high priest ; and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes .
41014054	And Peter had come after him at a distance , even into the house of the high priest ; and he was seated with the captains , warming himself in the light of the fire .
41014055	Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for witness against Jesus so that they might put him to death ; and they were unable to get any .
41014056	For a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement .
41014057	Then some got up and gave false witness against him , saying ,
41014058	He said in our hearing , I will put an end to this Temple which is made with hands , and in three days I will make another without hands .
41014059	And even so their witness was not in agreement .
41014060	And the high priest got up in the middle of them , and said to Jesus , Do you say nothing in answer ? what is it which these say against you ?
41014061	But he kept quiet and said nothing . Again the high priest questioning him said , Are you the Christ , the son of the Holy One ?
41014062	And Jesus said , I am : and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power , and coming with the clouds of heaven .
41014063	And the high priest , violently parting his robes , said , What more need have we of witnesses ?
41014064	His words against God have come to your ears : what is your opinion ? And they all said it was right for him to be put to death .
41014065	And some put shame on him and , covering his face , gave him blows and said to him , Now say what is to come : and the captains took him and gave him blows with their hands .
41014066	And while Peter was down in the open square of the building , one of the servant-girls of the high priest came ;
41014067	And seeing Peter warming himself by the fire , she gave him a look , and said , You were with this Nazarene , even Jesus .
41014068	But he said , I have no knowledge of him , or of what you are saying : and he went out into the doorway ; and there came the cry of a cock .
41014069	And the girl saw him , and said again to those who were near , This is one of them .
41014070	But again he said it was not so . And after a little time , again those who were near said to Peter , Truly you are one of them ; for you are a Galilaean .
41014071	But , with curses and oaths , he said , I have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking .
41014072	And in the same minute , the cock gave a second cry . And it came to Peter's mind how Jesus had said to him , Before the cock's second cry , you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me . And at this thought he was overcome with weeping .
41015001	And the first thing in the morning the chief priests , with those in authority and the scribes and all the Sanhedrin , had a meeting , and put cords round Jesus , and took him away , and gave him up to Pilate .
41015002	And Pilate put a question to him , Are you the King of the Jews ? And he , answering , said to him , You say so .
41015003	And the chief priests said a number of things against him .
41015004	And Pilate again put a question , Do you say nothing in answer ? see how much evil they say you have done .
41015005	But Jesus gave no more answers , so that Pilate was full of wonder .
41015006	Now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request .
41015007	And there was one named Barabbas , in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life .
41015008	And the people went up , requesting him to do as he had done for them in other years .
41015009	And Pilate said in answer to them , Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free ?
41015010	For he saw that the chief priests had given him up through envy .
41015011	But the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let Barabbas go free .
41015012	And Pilate again said in answer to them , What then am I to do to him to whom you give the name of the King of the Jews ?
41015013	And they said again loudly , To the cross with him !
41015014	And Pilate said to them , Why , what evil has he done ? But their cry was the louder , To the cross !
41015015	And Pilate , desiring to do what was pleasing to the people , let Barabbas go free , and gave up Jesus , when he had been whipped , to be put to death on the cross .
41015016	And the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the Praetorium , and they got together all the band .
41015017	And they put a purple robe on him , and twisting a crown of thorns , they put it on him ;
41015018	And , as if honouring him , they said , Long life to the King of the Jews !
41015019	And they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and , going down on their knees , gave him worship .
41015020	And when they had made sport of him , they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him . And they took him out to put him to death on the cross .
41015021	And they made one , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , who was going by , coming from the country , go with them , so that he might take his cross .
41015022	And they took him to the place named Golgotha , which is , Dead Man's Head .
41015023	And they gave him wine mixed with myrrh ; but he did not take it .
41015024	And he was nailed to the cross ; and they made a division of his clothing among them , putting to the decision of chance what everyone was to take .
41015025	And it was the third hour when they put him on the cross .
41015026	And the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
41015027	And they put two thieves on crosses with him , one on his right side , and one on his left .
41015029	And those who went by made sport of him , shaking their heads , and saying , Ha ! you who give the Temple to destruction , and put it up again in three days ,
41015030	Keep yourself from death , and come down from the cross .
41015031	In the same way the chief priests , laughing at him among themselves with the scribes , said , A saviour of others , he has no salvation for himself .
41015032	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , come down now from the cross , so that we may see and have belief . And those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him .
41015033	And when the sixth hour had come , it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour .
41015034	And at the ninth hour , Jesus said in a loud voice , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , My God , my God , why are you turned away from me ?
41015035	And some of those who were near , hearing it , said , See , he is crying to Elijah .
41015036	And one of them went quickly and , getting a sponge full of bitter wine , put it on a rod , and gave it to him for drink , saying , Let be ; let us see if Elijah will come to take him down .
41015037	And Jesus gave a loud cry , and gave up his spirit .
41015038	And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end .
41015039	And when the captain , who was near , saw how he gave up his spirit , he said , Truly this man was a son of God .
41015040	And there were women watching from a distance : among them were Mary Magdalene , and Mary , the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ,
41015041	Who went with him when he was in Galilee and took care of him ; and a number of other women who came up with him to Jerusalem .
41015042	And when it was evening , because it was the time of getting ready , that is , the day before the Sabbath ,
41015043	There came Joseph of Arimathaea , a responsible man in high honour , who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God ; and he went in to Pilate without fear , and made a request for the body of Jesus .
41015044	And Pilate was surprised that he was dead ; and , sending for the captain , he put a question to see if he had been dead for long .
41015045	And when he had news of it from the captain , he let Joseph have the body .
41015046	And he got a linen cloth and , taking him down , put the linen cloth round him , and put him in a place for the dead which had been cut out of a rock ; and a stone was rolled against the door .
41015047	And Mary Magdalene and Mary , the mother of Joses , saw where he was put .
41016001	And when the Sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene and Mary , the mother of James , and Salome , got spices , so that they might come and put them on him .
41016002	And very early after dawn on the first day of the week , they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put .
41016003	And they were saying among themselves , Who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us ?
41016004	And looking up , they saw that the stone was rolled back ; and it was of great size .
41016005	And when they went in , they saw a young man seated on the right side , dressed in a white robe ; and they were full of wonder .
41016006	And he said to them , Do not be troubled : you are looking for Jesus , the Nazarene , who has been put to death on the cross ; he has come back from the dead ; he is not here : see , the place where they put him !
41016007	But go , say to his disciples and to Peter , He goes before you into Galilee : there you will see him , as he said to you .
41016008	And they went out quickly from the place , because fear and great wonder had come on them : and they said nothing to anyone , because they were full of fear that . . .
41016009	Now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week , he went first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits .
41016010	She went and gave news of it to those who had been with him , while they were sorrowing and weeping .
41016011	And they , when it came to their ears that he was living , and had been seen by her , had no belief in it .
41016012	And after these things he was seen in another form by two of them , while they were walking on their way into the country .
41016013	And they went away and gave news of it to the rest ; and they had no belief in what was said .
41016014	And later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food ; and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard , and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dead .
41016015	And he said to them , Go into all the world , and give the good news to everyone .
41016016	He who has faith and is given baptism will get salvation ; but he who has not faith will be judged .
41016017	And these signs will be with those who have faith : in my name they will send out evil spirits ; and they will make use of new languages ;
41016018	They will take up snakes , and if there is poison in their drink , it will do them no evil ; they will put their hands on those who are ill , and they will get well .
41016019	So then the Lord Jesus , after he had said these words to them , was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God .
41016020	And they went out , preaching everywhere , the Lord working with them , and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after . So be it .
42001001	As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us ,
42001002	As they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word ,
42001003	It seemed good to me , having made observation , with great care , of the direction of events in their order , to put the facts in writing for you , most noble Theophilus ;
42001004	So that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching .
42001005	In the days of Herod , king of Judaea , there was a certain priest , by name Zacharias , of the order of Abijah ; and he had a wife of the family of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
42001006	They were upright in the eyes of God , keeping all the rules and orders of God , and doing no wrong .
42001007	And they were without children , because Elisabeth had never given birth , and they were at that time very old .
42001008	Now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before God ,
42001009	And as was the way of the priests , he had to go into the Temple to see to the burning of perfumes .
42001010	And all the people were offering prayers outside , at the time of the burning of perfumes .
42001011	And he saw an angel of the Lord in his place on the right side of the altar .
42001012	And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear came on him .
42001013	But the angel said , Have no fear , Zacharias , for your prayer has come to the ears of God , and your wife Elisabeth will have a son , and his name will be John .
42001014	And you will be glad and have great delight ; and numbers of people will have joy at his birth .
42001015	For he will be great in the eyes of the Lord ; he will not take wine or strong drink ; and he will be full of the Spirit of God from his birth .
42001016	And through him great numbers of the children of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God .
42001017	And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah , turning the hearts of fathers to their children , and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness ; to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the Lord .
42001018	And Zacharias said to the angel , How may I be certain of this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is far on in years .
42001019	And the angel , answering , said , I am Gabriel , whose place is before God ; I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news .
42001020	Now , see , you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about , because you had not faith in my words , which will have effect at the right time .
42001021	And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time .
42001022	And when he came out he was not able to say anything , and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple ; and he was making signs to them without words .
42001023	And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended , he went back to his house .
42001024	After that time , Elisabeth , being certain that she was to become a mother , kept herself from men's eyes for five months , saying ,
42001025	The Lord has done this to me , for his eyes were on me , to take away my shame in the eyes of men .
42001026	Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee , named Nazareth ,
42001027	To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph , of the family of David ; and the name of the virgin was Mary .
42001028	And the angel came in to her and said , Peace be with you , to whom special grace has been given ; the Lord is with you .
42001029	But she was greatly troubled at his words , and said to herself , What may be the purpose of these words ?
42001030	And the angel said to her , Have no fear , Mary , for you have God's approval .
42001031	And see , you will give birth to a son , and his name will be Jesus .
42001032	He will be great , and will be named the Son of the Most High : and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David , his father :
42001033	He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever , and of his kingdom there will be no end .
42001034	And Mary said to the angel , How may this be , because I have had no knowledge of a man ?
42001035	And the angel in answer said to her , The Holy Spirit will come on you , and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you , and so that which will come to birth will be named holy , Son of God .
42001036	Even now Elisabeth , who is of your family , is to be a mother , though she is old : and this is the sixth month with her who was without children .
42001037	For there is nothing which God is not able to do .
42001038	And Mary said : I am the servant of the Lord ; may it be to me as you say . And the angel went away .
42001039	Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands , to a town of Judah ;
42001040	And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms .
42001041	And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth , the baby made a sudden move inside her ; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit ,
42001042	And she said with a loud voice : May blessing be on you among women , and a blessing on the child of your body .
42001043	How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me ?
42001044	For , truly , when the sound of your voice came to my ears , the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy .
42001045	Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done .
42001046	And Mary said : My soul gives glory to God ;
42001047	My spirit is glad in God my Saviour .
42001048	For he has had pity on his servant , though she is poor and lowly placed : and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me .
42001049	For he who is strong has done great things for me ; and holy is his name .
42001050	His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him .
42001051	With his arm he has done acts of power ; he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts .
42001052	He has put down kings from their seats , lifting up on high the men of low degree .
42001053	Those who had no food he made full of good things ; the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands ;
42001054	His help he has given to Israel , his servant , so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever ,
42001055	As he gave his word to our fathers .
42001056	And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house .
42001057	Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth , and she had a son .
42001058	And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her , and they took part in her joy .
42001059	And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child , and they would have given him the name of Zacharias , his father's name ;
42001060	But his mother made answer and said , No , his name is John .
42001061	And they said , Not one of your relations has that name .
42001062	And they made signs to his father , to say what name was to be given to him .
42001063	And he sent for writing materials and put down : His name is John ; and they were all surprised .
42001064	And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God .
42001065	And fear came on all those who were living round about them : and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill-country of Judaea .
42001066	And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said , What will this child be ? For the hand of the Lord was with him .
42001067	And his father , Zacharias , was full of the Holy Spirit , and with the voice of a prophet said these words :
42001068	Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , for he has come to his people and made them free ,
42001069	Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ,
42001070	( As he said , by the mouth of his holy prophets , from the earliest times , )
42001071	Salvation from those who are against us , and from the hands of those who have hate for us ;
42001072	To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word ,
42001073	The oath which he made to Abraham , our father ,
42001074	That we , being made free from the fear of those who are against us , might give him worship ,
42001075	In righteousness and holy living before him all our days .
42001076	And you , child , will be named the prophet of the Most High : you will go before the face of the Lord , to make ready his ways ;
42001077	To give knowledge of salvation to his people , through the forgiveness of sins ,
42001078	Because of the loving mercies of our God , by which the dawn from heaven has come to us ,
42001079	To give light to those in dark places , and in the shade of death , so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace .
42001080	And the child became tall , and strong in spirit ; and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel .
42002001	Now it came about in those days that an order went out from Caesar Augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world .
42002002	This was the first numbering , which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria .
42002003	And all men went to be numbered , everyone to his town .
42002004	And Joseph went up from Galilee , out of the town of Nazareth , into Judaea , to Beth-lehem , the town of David , because he was of the house and family of David ,
42002005	To be put on the list with Mary , his future wife , who was about to become a mother .
42002006	And while they were there , the time came for her to give birth .
42002007	And she had her first son ; and folding him in linen , she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food , because there was no room for them in the house .
42002008	And in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields , watching over their flock by night .
42002009	And an angel of the Lord came to them , and the glory of the Lord was shining round about them : and fear came on them .
42002010	And the angel said , Have no fear ; for truly , I give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people :
42002011	For on this day , in the town of David , a Saviour has come to birth , who is Christ the Lord .
42002012	And this is the sign to you : you will see a young child folded in linen , in the place where the cattle have their food .
42002013	And suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven , giving praise to God , and saying ,
42002014	Glory to God in the highest , and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased .
42002015	And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven , the keepers of the sheep said to one another , Let us go now to Beth-lehem , and see this thing which has come about , which the Lord has made clear to us .
42002016	And they came quickly , and saw Mary and Joseph , and the child in the place where the cattle had their food .
42002017	And when they saw it , they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child .
42002018	And all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep .
42002019	But Mary kept all these words in her heart , and gave much thought to them .
42002020	Then the keepers of the sheep went back , giving glory and praise to God for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen , as it had been said to them .
42002021	And when , after eight days , the time came for his circumcision , he was named Jesus , the name which the angel had given to him before his birth .
42002022	And when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of Moses had come to an end , they took him to Jerusalem to give him to the Lord
42002023	( As it says in the law of the Lord , Every mother's first male child is to be holy to the Lord ) ,
42002024	And to make an offering , as it is ordered in the law of the Lord , of two doves or other young birds .
42002025	And there was then in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon ; and he was an upright man , fearing God and waiting for the comfort of Israel : and the Holy Spirit was on him .
42002026	And he had knowledge , through the Holy Spirit , that he would not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ .
42002027	And full of the Spirit he came into the Temple ; and when the father and mother came in with the child Jesus , to do with him what was ordered by the law ,
42002028	Then he took him in his arms and gave praise to God and said ,
42002029	Now you are letting your servant go in peace , O Lord , as you have said ;
42002030	For my eyes have seen your salvation ,
42002031	Which you have made ready before the face of all nations ;
42002032	A light of revelation to the Gentiles , and the glory of your people Israel .
42002033	And his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him .
42002034	And Simeon gave them his blessing and said to Mary , his mother , See , this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in Israel , and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said ;
42002035	( And a sword will go through your heart ; ) so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light .
42002036	And there was one , Anna , a woman prophet , the daughter of Phanuel , of the family of Asher ( she was very old , and after seven years of married life
42002037	She had been a widow for eighty-four years ) ; she was in the Temple at all times , worshipping with prayers and going without food , night and day .
42002038	And coming up at that time , she gave praise to God , talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of Jerusalem .
42002039	And when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the Lord , they went back to Galilee , to Nazareth , the town where they were living .
42002040	And the child became tall and strong and full of wisdom , and the grace of God was on him .
42002041	And every year his father and mother went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover .
42002042	And when he was twelve years old , they went up , as their way was , to the feast ;
42002043	And when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back , the boy Jesus was still in Jerusalem , but they had no knowledge of it :
42002044	And in the belief that he was with some of their number , they went a day's journey ; and after looking for him among their relations and friends ,
42002045	And seeing that he was not there , they went back to Jerusalem , to make search for him .
42002046	And after three days they came across him in the Temple , seated among the wise men , giving ear to their words and putting questions to them .
42002047	And all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave .
42002048	And when they saw him they were surprised , and his mother said to him , Son , why have you done this to us ? see , your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow .
42002049	And he said to them , Why were you looking for me ? was it not clear to you that my right place was in my Father's house ?
42002050	And his words seemed strange to them .
42002051	And he went down with them and came to Nazareth ; and did as he was ordered : and his mother kept all these words in her heart .
42002052	And Jesus was increasing in wisdom and in years , and in grace before God and men .
42003001	Now in the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being ruler of Judaea , and Herod being king of Galilee , his brother Philip king of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias king of Abilene ,
42003002	When Annas and Caiaphas were high priests , the word of the Lord came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the waste land .
42003003	And he came into all the country round about Jordan , preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed .
42003004	As it says in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , The voice of one crying in the waste land , Make ready the way of the Lord , make his roads straight .
42003005	Every valley will be lifted up , and all the mountains and hills made low , and the twisted will be made straight , and the rough ways smooth ;
42003006	And all flesh will see the salvation of God .
42003007	So he said to the people who went out to him for baptism : You offspring of snakes , at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come ?
42003008	Make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed ; and do not say to yourselves , We have Abraham for our father : for I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children of Abraham .
42003009	And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees ; and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire .
42003010	And the people put questions to him , saying , What have we to do ?
42003011	And he made answer and said to them , He who has two coats , let him give to him who has not even one ; and he who has food , let him do the same .
42003012	Then tax-farmers came to him for baptism and said to him , Master , what have we to do ?
42003013	And he said to them , Do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount .
42003014	And men of the army put questions to him , saying , And what have we to do ? And he said to them , Do no violent acts to any man , and do not take anything without right , and let your payment be enough for you .
42003015	And while the people were waiting , and all men were questioning in their hearts about John , if he was the Christ or not ,
42003016	John made answer , saying to them all , Truly , I give you baptism with water , but one is coming who is greater than I , whose shoes I am not good enough to undo : he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit , and with fire :
42003017	In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain ; he will put the good grain in his store , but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out .
42003018	And so comforting them with these and other words , he gave the good news to the people ;
42003019	But Herod the king , because John had made a protest on account of Herodias , his brother's wife , and other evil things which Herod had done ,
42003020	Did this most evil thing of all , and had John shut up in prison .
42003021	Now it came about that when all the people had been given baptism , Jesus , having had baptism with them , was in prayer , when , the heaven being open ,
42003022	The Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove , and a voice came from heaven , saying , You are my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well pleased .
42003023	And Jesus at this time was about thirty years old , being the son ( as it seemed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli ,
42003024	The son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
42003025	The son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,
42003026	The son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda ,
42003027	The son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri ,
42003028	The son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er ,
42003029	The son of Jesus , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi ,
42003030	The son of Symeon , the son of Judas , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim ,
42003031	The son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David ,
42003032	The son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon , the son of Nahshon ,
42003033	The son of Amminadab , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
42003034	The son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor ,
42003035	The son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah ,
42003036	The son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech ,
42003037	The son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan ,
42003038	The son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God .
42004001	And Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , came back from the Jordan , and was guided by the Spirit in the waste land
42004002	For forty days , being tested by the Evil One . And he had no food in those days ; and when they came to an end , he was in need of food .
42004003	And the Evil One said to him , If you are the Son of God , give orders to this stone to become bread .
42004004	And Jesus made answer to him , It has been said in the Writings , Bread is not man's only need .
42004005	And he took him up and let him see all the kingdoms of the earth in a minute of time .
42004006	And the Evil One said , I will give you authority over all these , and the glory of them , for it has been given to me , and I give it to anyone at my pleasure .
42004007	If then you will give worship to me , it will all be yours .
42004008	And Jesus in answer said to him , It has been said in the Writings , Give worship to the Lord your God , and be his servant only .
42004009	And he took him to Jerusalem and put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him , If you are the Son of God , let yourself go down from here ; for it is said in the Writings ,
42004010	He will give his angels orders to take care of you :
42004011	And , In their hands they will keep you up , so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone .
42004012	And Jesus made answer and said to him , It is said in the Writings , You may not put the Lord your God to the test .
42004013	And when all these tests were ended the Evil One went away from him for a time .
42004014	And Jesus came back to Galilee in the power of the Spirit , and the news of him went through all the country round about .
42004015	And he was teaching in their Synagogues and all men gave him praise .
42004016	And he came to Nazareth , where he had been as a child , and he went , as his way was , into the Synagogue on the Sabbath , and got up to give a reading .
42004017	And the book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him and , opening the book , he came on the place where it is said ,
42004018	The Spirit of the Lord is on me , because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor ; he has sent me to make well those who are broken-hearted ; to say that the prisoners will be let go , and the blind will see , and to make the wounded free from their chains ,
42004019	To give knowledge that the year of the Lord's good pleasure is come .
42004020	And shutting the book he gave it back to the servant and took his seat : and the eyes of all in the Synagogue were fixed on him .
42004021	Then he said to them , Today this word has come true in your hearing .
42004022	And they were all giving witness , with wonder , to the words of grace which came from his mouth : and they said , Is not this the son of Joseph ?
42004023	And he said to them , Without doubt you will say to me , Let the medical man make himself well : the things which to our knowledge were done at Capernaum , do them here in your country .
42004024	And he said to them , Truly I say to you , No prophet is honoured in his country .
42004025	Truly I say to you , There were a number of widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months and there was no food in the land ;
42004026	But Elijah was not sent to one of them , but only to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow .
42004027	And there were a number of lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and not one of them was made clean , but only Naaman the Syrian .
42004028	And all who were in the Synagogue were very angry when these things were said to them .
42004029	And they got up and took him out of the town to the edge of the mountain on which their town was , so that they might send him down to his death .
42004030	But he came through them and went on his way .
42004031	And he came down to Capernaum , a town of Galilee ; and he was giving them teaching on the Sabbath .
42004032	And they were surprised at his teaching , for his word was with authority .
42004033	And there was a man in the Synagogue who had an unclean spirit ; and he gave a loud cry and said ,
42004034	Let us be ! what have we to do with you , Jesus of Nazareth ? have you come to put an end to us ? I have knowledge who you are , the Holy One of God .
42004035	And Jesus said to him , Be quiet , and come out of him . And when the evil spirit had put him down on the earth in the middle of them , he came out of him , having done him no damage .
42004036	And wonder came on them all and they said to one another , What are these words ? for with authority and power he gives orders to the evil spirits and they come out .
42004037	And there was much talk about him in all the places round about .
42004038	And he got up and went out of the Synagogue and went into the house of Simon . And Simon's wife's mother was very ill with a burning heat ; and in answer to their prayers for her
42004039	He went near her , and with a sharp word he gave orders to the disease and it went away from her ; and straight away she got up and took care of their needs .
42004040	And at sundown all those who had anyone ill with any sort of disease , took them to him , and he put his hands on every one of them and made them well .
42004041	And evil spirits came out of a number of them , crying out and saying , You are the Son of God . But he gave them sharp orders not to say a word , because they had knowledge that he was the Christ .
42004042	And when it was day , he came out and went to a waste place ; and great numbers of people came looking for him , and they came to him and would have kept him from going away .
42004043	But he said to them , I have to give the good news of the kingdom of God in other towns , because that is why I was sent .
42004044	And he was teaching in the Synagogues of Galilee .
42005001	Now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him , and to have knowledge of the word of God , he was by a wide stretch of water named Gennesaret ;
42005002	And he saw two boats by the edge of the water , but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets .
42005003	And he got into one of the boats , the property of Simon , and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land . And being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat .
42005004	And when his talk was ended , he said to Simon , Go out into deep water , and let down your nets for fish .
42005005	And Simon , answering , said , Master , we were working all night and we took nothing : but at your word I will let down the nets .
42005006	And when they had done this , they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken ;
42005007	And they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help . And they came , and the two boats were so full that they were going down .
42005008	But Simon , when he saw it , went down at the knees of Jesus and said , Go away from me , O Lord , for I am a sinner .
42005009	For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him , at the number of fish which they had taken ;
42005010	And so were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were working with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , Have no fear ; from this time forward you will be a fisher of men .
42005011	And when they had got their boats to the land , they gave up everything and went after him .
42005012	And it came about that while he was in one of the towns , there was a leper there : and when he saw Jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him , saying , Lord , if it is your pleasure , you have power to make me clean .
42005013	And he put out his hand to him and said , It is my pleasure ; be clean . And straight away his disease went from him .
42005014	And he gave him orders : Say nothing to any man , but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean , as the law of Moses says , and for a witness to them .
42005015	But news of him went out all the more , in every direction , and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases .
42005016	But he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer .
42005017	And it came about that on one of these days he was teaching ; and some Pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there , who had come from every town of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem ; and the power of the Lord was with him , to make those who were ill free from their diseases .
42005018	And some men had with them , on a bed , a man who was ill , without power of moving ; and they made attempts to get him in and put him before Jesus .
42005019	And because of the mass of people , there was no way to get him in ; so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof , on his bed , into the middle in front of Jesus .
42005020	And seeing their faith he said , Man , you have forgiveness for your sins .
42005021	And the scribes and Pharisees were having an argument , saying , Who is this , who has no respect for God ? who is able to give forgiveness for sins , but God only ?
42005022	But Jesus , who had knowledge of their thoughts , said to them , Why are you reasoning in your hearts ?
42005023	Which is the simpler : to say , You have forgiveness for your sins ; or to say , Get up and go ?
42005024	But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins , ( he said to the man who was ill , ) I say to you , Get up , and take up your bed , and go into your house .
42005025	And straight away he got up before them , and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to God .
42005026	And wonder overcame them all , and they gave glory to God ; and they were full of fear , saying , We have seen strange things today .
42005027	And after these things he went out , and saw Levi , a tax-farmer , seated at the place where taxes were taken , and said to him , Come after me .
42005028	And giving up his business , he got up and went after him .
42005029	And Levi made a great feast for him in his house : and a great number of tax-farmers and others were seated at table with them .
42005030	And the Pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples , saying , Why do you take food and drink with tax-farmers and sinners ?
42005031	And Jesus , answering , said to them , Those who are well have no need of a medical man , but those who are ill .
42005032	I have come , not to get the upright , but sinners , so that they may be turned from their sins .
42005033	And they said to him , The disciples of John frequently go without food , and make prayers , and so do the disciples of the Pharisees ; but your disciples take food and drink .
42005034	And Jesus said , Are you able to make the friends of the newly-married man go without food when he is with them ?
42005035	But the days will come when he will be taken away from them , and then they will go without food .
42005036	And he said to them , in a story , No man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat , for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old .
42005037	And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins , for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine , and the wine be let out , and the skins come to destruction .
42005038	But new wine has to be put into new wine-skins .
42005039	And no man , having had old wine , has any desire for new , for he says , The old is better .
42006001	Now it came about that on the Sabbath he was going through the fields of grain , and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food , crushing them in their hands .
42006002	But some of the Pharisees said , Why do you do what it is not right to do on the Sabbath ?
42006003	And Jesus said , Have you not seen in the Writings what David did when he was in need of food , he , and those who were with him ;
42006004	How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread , which only the priests may take , and gave it to those who were with him ?
42006005	And he said , The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath .
42006006	And it came about , on another Sabbath , that he went into the Synagogue and was teaching there . And a man was there whose right hand was dead .
42006007	And the scribes and Pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath , so that they might be able to say something against him .
42006008	But he had knowledge of their thoughts ; and he said to the man whose hand was dead , Get up and come into the middle . And he got up and came forward .
42006009	And Jesus said , I put the question to you , Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil ? to give life or to take it away ?
42006010	And looking round on all of them , he said to him , Put out your hand . And he did so : and his hand was made well .
42006011	But they were full of wrath , and were talking together about what they might do to Jesus .
42006012	And it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer ; and he was all night in prayer to God .
42006013	And the day came and , turning to his disciples , he made a selection from among them of twelve , to whom he gave the name of Apostles ;
42006014	Simon , to whom he gave the name of Peter , and Andrew , his brother , and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew
42006015	And Matthew and Thomas and James , the son of Alphaeus , and Simon , who was named the Zealot ,
42006016	And Judas , the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , he who was false to him .
42006017	And he came down with them to a level place , and a great band of his disciples , and a very great number of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the parts of Tyre and Sidon by the sea , came to give hearing to him , and to be made well from their diseases ;
42006018	And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were made well .
42006019	And all the people were desiring to be touched by him , for power came from him and made them all well .
42006020	And turning his eyes to his disciples he said , Happy are you who are poor : for the kingdom of God is yours .
42006021	Happy are you who are in need of food now : for you will be made full . Happy are you who are weeping now ; for you will be glad .
42006022	Happy are you , when men have hate for you , and put you away from among them and say angry words to you , turning away in disgust at your name , because of the Son of man .
42006023	Be glad in that day , and be lifted up for joy , for your reward in heaven will be great : for their fathers did these same things to the prophets .
42006024	But unhappy are you who have wealth : for you have been comforted now .
42006025	Unhappy are you who are full of food now : for you will be in need . Unhappy are you who are laughing now : for you will be crying in sorrow .
42006026	Unhappy are you when all men give you their approval : for so their fathers did to the false prophets .
42006027	But I say to you who give ear to me , Have love for those who are against you , do good to those who have hate for you ,
42006028	Give blessing to those who give you curses , say prayers for those who are cruel to you .
42006029	If a man gives you a blow on one side of your face , then let the other side be turned to him ; from him who takes away your coat , do not keep back your robe .
42006030	Give to everyone who comes with a request , and if a man takes away your property , make no attempt to get it back again .
42006031	Do to others as you would have them do to you .
42006032	If you have love for those who have love for you , what credit is it to you ? for even sinners have love for those who have love for them .
42006033	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is it to you ? for even sinners do the same .
42006034	And if you let those have the use of your money , from whom you are hoping to get it back , what credit is it to you ? even sinners do so to sinners , hoping to get back as much as they gave .
42006035	But be loving to those who are against you and do them good , and give them your money , not giving up hope , and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the Most High : for he is kind to evil men , and to those who have hard hearts .
42006036	Be full of pity , even as your Father is full of pity .
42006037	Be not judges of others , and you will not be judged : do not give punishment to others , and you will not get punishment yourselves : make others free , and you will be made free :
42006038	Give , and it will be given to you ; good measure , crushed down , full and running over , they will give to you . For in the same measure as you give , it will be given to you again .
42006039	And he gave them teaching in the form of a story , saying , Is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another ? will they not go falling together into a hole ?
42006040	The disciple is not greater than his master , but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master .
42006041	And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye , but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye ?
42006042	How will you say to your brother , Brother , let me take the grain of dust out of your eye , when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye ? O false one ! first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your brother's eye .
42006043	For no good tree gives bad fruit , and no bad tree gives good fruit .
42006044	For every tree is judged by its fruit . Men do not get figs from thorns , or grapes from blackberry plants .
42006045	The good man , out of the good store of his heart , gives good things ; and the evil man , out of his evil store , gives evil : for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth .
42006046	Why do you say to me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ?
42006047	Everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them , I will make clear to you what he is like :
42006048	He is like a man building a house , who went deep and put the base of it on a rock ; and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house , it was not moved , because the building was good .
42006049	But he who gives hearing , without doing , is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it ; and when the force of the river came against it , straight away it came down ; and the destruction of that house was great .
42007001	After he had come to the end of all his words in the hearing of the people , he went into Capernaum .
42007002	And a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him ; this servant was ill and near to death .
42007003	And when news of Jesus came to his ears , he sent to him rulers of the Jews , requesting that he would come and make his servant well .
42007004	And they , when they came to Jesus , made their request warmly , saying ,
42007005	It is right for you to do this for him , because he is a friend to our nation , and himself has put up a Synagogue for us .
42007006	And Jesus went with them . And when he was not far from the house , the man sent friends to him , saying , Lord , do not give yourself trouble : for I am not important enough for you to come into my house :
42007007	And I had the feeling that I was not even good enough to come to you : but say the word only , and my servant will be well .
42007008	For I , myself , am a man under authority , having men under me ; and I say to this one , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my servant , Do this , and he does it .
42007009	And when these things were said to Jesus , he was surprised , and , turning to the mass of people coming after him , said , I have not seen such great faith , no , not in Israel .
42007010	And when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well .
42007011	And it came about , after a little time , that he went to a town named Nain ; and his disciples went with him , and a great number of people .
42007012	Now when he came near the door of the town , a dead man was being taken out , the only son of his mother , who was a widow : and a great number of people from the town were with her .
42007013	And when the Lord saw her , he had pity on her and said to her , Be not sad .
42007014	And he came near , and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was : and those who were moving it came to a stop . And he said , Young man , I say to you , Get up .
42007015	And the dead man got up , and words came from his lips . And he gave him to his mother .
42007016	And fear came on all , and they gave praise to God , saying , A great prophet is among us : and , God has given thought to his people .
42007017	And this story about him went through all Judaea and the places round about .
42007018	And the disciples of John gave him an account of all these things .
42007019	Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord , saying , Are you he who is to come , or are we waiting for another ?
42007020	And when the men came to him they said , John the Baptist has sent us to you , saying , Are you he who is to come , or are we waiting for another ?
42007021	At that time , he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains , and from evil spirits ; and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes .
42007022	And answering them he said , Go back and give news to John of what you have seen , and the things which have come to your ears ; the blind now see , those who had no power in their legs are walking , lepers are made clean , those who had no hearing now have their ears open , dead men come to life again , and the poor have the good news given to them .
42007023	And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me .
42007024	And when the men who were sent by John had gone away , he said to the people , about John , What did you go out into the waste land to see ? a tall stem moving in the wind ?
42007025	But what did you go out to see ? a man in soft clothing ? See now , those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings ' houses .
42007026	But what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet .
42007027	This is he of whom it has been said , See , I send my servant before your face , who will make ready your way before you .
42007028	I say to you , Among all the sons of women , not one is greater than John : but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
42007029	( And all the people , and the tax-farmers , to whom John had given baptism , when they had knowledge of these things , gave glory to God .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of God for themselves , not having had his baptism . )
42007031	What comparison am I to make of the men of this generation ? what are they like ?
42007032	They are like children who are seated in the market-place , crying out to one another , and saying , We made music for you , but you did not take part in the dance ; we gave cries of sorrow , but you were not sad .
42007033	For John the Baptist came , taking no food or drink , and you say , He has an evil spirit .
42007034	The Son of man came feasting , and you say , Here is a lover of food and wine , a friend of tax-farmers and sinners .
42007035	But wisdom is judged to be right by all her children .
42007036	And one of the Pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him . And he went into the Pharisee's house and took his seat at the table .
42007037	And there was a woman in the town who was a sinner ; and when she had news that he was a guest in the Pharisee's house , she took a bottle of perfume ,
42007038	And went in and took her place at the back of him , near his feet , weeping , so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes , and with her hair she made them dry , and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them .
42007039	Now when the Pharisee in whose house he was saw it , he said to himself , This man , if he was a prophet , would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him , that she is a sinner .
42007040	And Jesus , answering , said , Simon , I have something to say to you . And he said , Master , say on .
42007041	And he said , Two men were in debt to a certain man of business : one had a debt of five hundred pence , and the other of fifty .
42007042	When they were unable to make payment , he made the two of them free of their debts . Which of them , now , will have the greater love for him ?
42007043	Simon , in answer , said , It seems he whose debt was greater . And he said , Your decision is right .
42007044	And turning to the woman he said to Simon , You see this woman ? I came into your house ; you did not give me water for my feet : but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes , and drying them with her hair .
42007045	You did not give me a kiss : but she , from the time when I came in , has gone on kissing my feet .
42007046	You put no oil on my head : but she has put perfume on my feet .
42007047	And so I say to you , She will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number , because of her great love : but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love .
42007048	And he said to her , You have forgiveness for your sins .
42007049	And those who were seated at table with him said to themselves , Who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins ?
42007050	And he said to the woman , By your faith you have salvation ; go in peace .
42008001	And it came about , after a short time , that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of God , and with him were the twelve ,
42008002	And certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases , Mary named Magdalene , from whom seven evil spirits had gone out ,
42008003	And Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod's chief house-servant , and Susanna and a number of others , who gave him of their wealth for his needs .
42008004	And when a great number of people came together , and men from every town went out to him , he gave them teaching in the form of a story :
42008005	A man went out to put in seed , and while he was doing it , some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot , and was taken by the birds of heaven .
42008006	And some went on the rock , and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water .
42008007	And some went among thorns , and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth .
42008008	And some falling on good earth , came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much . And with these words he said in a loud voice , He who has ears , let him give ear .
42008009	And his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story .
42008010	And he said , To you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God ; but to the others , they are given in stories , so that seeing , they may not see , and though they give hearing , the sense will not be clear to them .
42008011	Now this is the point of the story : The seed is the word of God .
42008012	Those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing ; then the Evil One comes and takes away the word from their hearts , so that they may not have faith and get salvation .
42008013	And those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word ; but having no root , they have faith for a time , and when the test comes they give up .
42008014	And those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing , and go on their way , but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life , and they give no fruit .
42008015	And those in the good earth are those who , having given ear to the word , keep it with a good and true heart , and in quiet strength give fruit .
42008016	No man , when the light is lighted , puts a cover over it , or puts it under a bed , but he puts it on its table , so that those who come in may see the light .
42008017	For nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear , and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light .
42008018	So take care how you give hearing , for to him who has will be given , and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have .
42008019	And his mother and his brothers came to him , and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people .
42008020	And someone said to him , Your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you .
42008021	But he said to them in answer , My mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of God and do it .
42008022	Now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples ; and he said to them , Let us go over to the other side of the water : and they put out the boat .
42008023	But while they were sailing he went to sleep : and a storm of wind came down on the sea , and the boat became full of water and they were in danger .
42008024	Then they came to him and , awaking him out of his sleep , said , Master , Master , destruction is near . And he , when he was awake , gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves , and the storm came to an end , and all was calm .
42008025	And he said to them , Where is your faith ? And fear and wonder overcame them , and they said to one another , Who then is this , who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says ?
42008026	And they came to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
42008027	And when he had come to the land , there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits ; and for a long time he had had no clothing on , and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead .
42008028	And when he saw Jesus , he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said , What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? Do not be cruel to me .
42008029	For he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man . For frequently it would take a grip of him : and he was kept under control , and prisoned with chains ; but parting the chains in two , he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places .
42008030	And Jesus said to him , What is your name ? And he said , Legion ; for a number of spirits had gone into him .
42008031	And they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep .
42008032	Now there was a great herd of pigs in that place , getting food on the mountain : and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs , and he let them .
42008033	And the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs : and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction .
42008034	And when the men who took care of them saw what had come about , they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country .
42008035	And they went out to see what had taken place , and they came to Jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone , seated , clothed and with full use of his senses , at the feet of Jesus ; and fear came on them .
42008036	And those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well .
42008037	And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them ; for they were in great fear : and he got into a boat and went back .
42008038	But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him , but he sent him away , saying ,
42008039	Go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which God has done for you . And he went away , giving word through all the town of the great things which Jesus had done for him .
42008040	And when Jesus went back , the people were glad to see him , for they were all waiting for him .
42008041	Then there came a man named Jairus , who was a ruler in the Synagogue : and he went down at the feet of Jesus , desiring him to come to his house ;
42008042	For he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was near to death . But while he was on his way , the people were pushing to be near him .
42008043	And a woman , who had had a flow of blood for twelve years , and had given all her money to medical men , and not one of them was able to make her well ,
42008044	Came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe , and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped .
42008045	And Jesus said , Who was touching me ? And when they all said , It is not I , Peter and those who were with him said , Master , the people are pushing round you on every side .
42008046	But Jesus said , Someone was touching me , for I had the feeling that power had gone out from me .
42008047	And when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret , she came , shaking with fear , and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him , and how she was made well straight away .
42008048	And he said to her , Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace .
42008049	While he was still talking , someone came from the house of the ruler of the Synagogue , saying , Your daughter is dead ; do not go on troubling the Master .
42008050	But Jesus at these words said to him , Have no fear , only have faith , and she will be made well .
42008051	And when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him , but only Peter and John and James , and the father of the girl and her mother .
42008052	And all the people were weeping and crying for her ; but he said , Do not be sad , for she is not dead , but sleeping .
42008053	And they were laughing at him , being certain that she was dead .
42008054	But he , taking her hand , said to her , My child , get up .
42008055	And her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away : and he gave orders that food was to be given to her .
42008056	And her father and mother were full of wonder , but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone .
42009001	And getting the twelve together , he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases , to make them well .
42009002	And he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of God , and to make well those who were ill .
42009003	And he said to them , Take nothing for your journey , no stick or bag or bread or money , and do not take two coats .
42009004	And if you go into a house , let that house be your resting-place till you go away .
42009005	And if any people will not take you in , when you go away from that town , put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them .
42009006	And they went away , journeying through all the towns , preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places .
42009007	Now Herod the king had news of all these things : and he was in doubt , because it was said by some people that John had come back from the dead ;
42009008	And by some , that Elijah had come ; and by others , that one of the old prophets had come back to life .
42009009	And Herod said , I put John to death : but who is this , of whom such stories are given to me ? And he had a desire to see him .
42009010	And the twelve , when they came back , gave him an account of what they had done . And he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named Beth-saida .
42009011	But the people , getting news of it , went after him : and he was pleased to see them , and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God , and made those well who were in need of it .
42009012	And the day went on ; and the twelve came to him and said , Send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting-places and food for themselves , for we are in a waste place .
42009013	But he said , Give them food yourselves . And they said , We have only five cakes of bread and two fishes , if we do not go and get food for all these people .
42009014	For there were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them be seated in groups , about fifty to a group .
42009015	And they did so , and made them all be seated .
42009016	And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and , looking up to heaven , he said words of blessing over them , and when they had been broken , he gave them to the disciples to give to the people .
42009017	And they all took the food and had enough ; and they took up of the broken bits which were over , twelve baskets full .
42009018	And it came about that when he was in prayer , by himself , and the disciples were with him , he put a question to them , saying , Who do the people say I am ?
42009019	And they , answering , said , John the Baptist ; but others say Elijah ; and others , that one of the old prophets has come back .
42009020	And he said , But who do you say that I am ? And Peter , answering , said , The Christ of God .
42009021	But he gave them special orders , not to say this to any man ;
42009022	Saying , The Son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law , and be put to death , and on the third day he will come back to life .
42009023	And he said to them all , If any man has a desire to come after me , let him give up all , and take up his cross every day , and come after me .
42009024	For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him , but whoever gives up his life because of me , will keep it .
42009025	For what profit will a man have if he gets all the world , but undergoes loss or destruction himself ?
42009026	For if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words , the Son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
42009027	But truly I say to you , Some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God .
42009028	And about eight days after he had said these things , he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer .
42009029	And while he was in prayer , his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining .
42009030	And two men , Moses and Elijah , were talking with him ;
42009031	Who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in Jerusalem .
42009032	Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep : but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory and the two men who were with him .
42009033	And when they were about to go away from him , Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here ; let us make three tents , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah : having no knowledge of what he was saying .
42009034	And while he said these things , the shade of a cloud came over them , and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud .
42009035	And there was a voice from the cloud saying , This is my Son , the man of my selection ; give ear to him .
42009036	And after the voice was gone they saw that Jesus was by himself . And they kept quiet , and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen .
42009037	And on the day after , when they came down from the mountain , a great band of people came to him .
42009038	And a man from among them , crying out , said , Master , I make a request to you , give a thought to my son , for he is my only child :
42009039	And see , a spirit takes him , and suddenly he gives a cry , twisted in pain and streaming at the lips , and when it goes away from him at last , he is marked as from blows .
42009040	And I made a request to your disciples to send it out of him , but they were not able to do it .
42009041	And Jesus said , O generation without faith and false in heart , how long will I have to be with you and put up with you ? let your son come here .
42009042	And while he was coming , he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit . But Jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit , and made the boy well , and gave him back to his father .
42009043	And they were full of wonder at the great power of God . But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did , he said to his disciples ,
42009044	Let these words go deep into your ears , for the Son of man will be given up into the hands of men .
42009045	But this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it : and they had fear of questioning him about it .
42009046	Now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest .
42009047	But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts , he took a small child and put him by his side ,
42009048	And said to them , Whoever gives honour to this child in my name , gives honour to me : and whoever gives honour to me , gives honour to him who sent me : for whoever is least among you all , that man is great .
42009049	And John , answering , said , Master , we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name , and we did not let him do it , because he was not one of us .
42009050	But Jesus said to him , Let him do it , for he who is not against you is for you .
42009051	And it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up , his face was turned to go to Jerusalem ,
42009052	And he sent men before : and they came to a small town of Samaria to make ready for him .
42009053	But they would not have him there , because he was clearly going to Jerusalem .
42009054	And when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , Lord , may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them ?
42009055	But turning round he said sharp words to them .
42009056	And they went to another small town .
42009057	And when they were on the way , a certain man said to him , I will come after you wherever you go .
42009058	And Jesus said to him , Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have resting-places , but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head .
42009059	And he said to another , Come after me . But he said , Lord , let me first go and give the last honours to my father .
42009060	But he said to him , Let the dead take care of their dead ; it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of God .
42009061	And another man said , I will come with you , Lord , but first let me say a last good-day to those who are at my house .
42009062	But Jesus said , No man , having put his hand to the plough and looking back , is good enough for the kingdom of God .
42010001	Now after these things , the Lord made selection of seventy others and sent them before him , two together , into every town and place where he himself was about to come .
42010002	And he said to them , There is much grain ready to be cut , but not enough workers : so make prayer to the Lord of the grain-fields that he will send workers to get in the grain .
42010003	Go on your way : see , I send you out like lambs among wolves .
42010004	Take no bag for money or for food , and no shoes ; say no word to any man on the way .
42010005	And whenever you go into a house , first say , Peace be to this house .
42010006	And if a son of peace is there , your peace will be with him : but if not , it will come back to you again .
42010007	And keep in that same house , taking what food and drink they give you : for the worker has a right to his reward . Do not go from house to house .
42010008	And into whatever town you go , if they take you in , take whatever food is given to you :
42010009	And make well those in it who are ill and say to them , The kingdom of God is near to you .
42010010	But if you go into a town where they will not have you , go out into the streets of it and say ,
42010011	Even the dust of your town , which is on our feet , we put off as a witness against you ; but be certain of this , that the kingdom of God is near .
42010012	I say to you , It will be better in that day for Sodom than for that town .
42010013	A curse is on you , Chorazin ! A curse is on you , Beth-saida ! For if such works of power had been done in Tyre and Sidon as have been done in you , they would have been turned from their sins , in days gone by , seated in the dust .
42010014	But it will be better for Tyre and Sidon , in the day of judging , than for you .
42010015	And you , Capernaum , were you not lifted up to heaven ? you will go down to hell .
42010016	Whoever gives ear to you , gives ear to me ; and whoever is against you , is against me ; and whoever is against me , is against him who sent me .
42010017	And the seventy came back with joy , saying , Lord , even the evil spirits are under our power in your name .
42010018	And he said , I was watching for Satan , falling from heaven like a star .
42010019	See , I have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts , and over all the strength of him who is against you : and nothing will do you damage .
42010020	Do not be glad , however , because you have power over spirits , but because your names are recorded in heaven .
42010021	In that same hour he was full of joy in the Holy Spirit and said , I give praise to you , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning , and have made them clear to little children : for so , O Father , it was pleasing in your eyes .
42010022	All things have been given to me by my Father : and no one has knowledge of the Son , but only the Father : and of the Father , but only the Son , and he to whom the Son will make it clear .
42010023	And , turning to the disciples , he said privately , Happy are the eyes which see the things you see :
42010024	For I say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see , and have not seen them , and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears , and they had it not .
42010025	And a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test , saying , Master , what have I to do so that I may have eternal life ?
42010026	And he said to him , What does the law say , in your reading of it ?
42010027	And he , answering , said , Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind ; and for your neighbour as for yourself .
42010028	And he said , You have given the right answer : do this and you will have life .
42010029	But he , desiring to put himself in the right , said to Jesus , And who is my neighbour ?
42010030	And Jesus , answering him , said , A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he got into the hands of thieves , who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows , and when they went away , he was half dead .
42010031	And by chance a certain priest was going down that way : and when he saw him , he went by on the other side .
42010032	And in the same way , a Levite , when he came to the place and saw him , went by on the other side .
42010033	But a certain man of Samaria , journeying that way , came where he was , and when he saw him , he was moved with pity for him ,
42010034	And came to him and put clean linen round his wounds , with oil and wine ; and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him .
42010035	And the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said , Take care of him ; and if this money is not enough , when I come again I will give you whatever more is needed .
42010036	Which of these three men , in your opinion , was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves ?
42010037	And he said , The one who had mercy on him . And Jesus said , Go and do the same .
42010038	Now , while they were on their way , he came to a certain town ; and a woman named Martha took him into her house .
42010039	And she had a sister , by name Mary , who took her seat at the Lord's feet and gave attention to his words .
42010040	But Martha had her hands full of the work of the house , and she came to him and said , Lord , is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work ? Say to her that she is to give me some help .
42010041	But the Lord , answering , said to her , Martha , Martha , you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things :
42010042	Little is needed , or even one thing only : for Mary has taken that good part , which will not be taken away from her .
42011001	And it came about that he was in prayer in a certain place , and when he came to an end , one of his disciples said to him , Lord , will you give us teaching about prayer , as John did to his disciples ?
42011002	And he said to them , When you say your prayers , say , Father , may your name be kept holy and your kingdom come .
42011003	Give us every day bread for our needs .
42011004	May we have forgiveness for our sins , as we make free all those who are in debt to us . And let us not be put to the test .
42011005	And he said to them , Which of you , having a friend , would go to him in the middle of the night and say to him , Friend , let me have three cakes of bread ;
42011006	Because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey , and I have nothing to put before him ;
42011007	And he , from inside the house , would say in answer , Do not be a trouble to me ; the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; it is not possible for me to get up and give to you ?
42011008	I say to you , Though he will not get up and give to him , because he is his friend , still , if he keeps on making his request , he will get up and give him as much as he has need of .
42011009	And I say to you , Make requests , and they will be answered ; what you are searching for , you will get ; when you give the sign , the door will be open to you .
42011010	For to everyone who makes a request , it will be given ; and he who is searching will get his desire ; and to him who gives the sign , the door will be open .
42011011	And which of you , being a father , will give a stone to his son , who makes request for bread ? or for a fish , will give him a snake ?
42011012	Or for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
42011013	If , then , you who are evil are able to give good things to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who make request to him ?
42011014	And he was sending an evil spirit out of a man who was without the power of talking . And it came about that when the spirit had gone the man had the power of talking ; and the people were full of wonder .
42011015	But some of them said , He sends out evil spirits by Beelzebul , the ruler of evil spirits .
42011016	And others , testing him , were looking for a sign from heaven from him .
42011017	But he , having knowledge of their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom in which there is division is made waste ; and a house in which there is division comes to destruction .
42011018	If , then , Satan is at war with himself , how will he keep his kingdom ? because you say that I send evil spirits out of men by the help of Beelzebul .
42011019	And if I , by Beelzebul , send out evil spirits , by whose help do your sons send them out ? so let them be your judges .
42011020	But if I , by the finger of God , send out evil spirits , then the kingdom of God has overtaken you .
42011021	When the strong man armed keeps watch over his house , then his goods are safe :
42011022	But when one who is stronger makes an attack on him and overcomes him , he takes away his instruments of war , in which he had put his faith , and makes division of his goods .
42011023	He who is not with me is against me , and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away .
42011024	The unclean spirit , when he has gone out of a man , goes through dry places , looking for rest ; and when he does not get it , he says , I will go back to my house from which I came .
42011025	And when he comes , he sees that it has been made fair and clean .
42011026	Then he goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they go in , and take their places there : and the last condition of that man is worse than the first .
42011027	And it came about that when he said these things , a certain woman among the people said in a loud voice , Happy is the body which gave you birth , and the breasts from which you took milk .
42011028	But he said , More happy are they who give hearing to the word of God and keep it .
42011029	And when a great number of people came together to him , he said , This generation is an evil generation : it is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah .
42011030	For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will the Son of man be to this generation .
42011031	The queen of the South will come up on the day of judging and give her decision against the men of this generation : for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon ; and now something greater than Solomon is here .
42011032	The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation : for they were turned away from their sins at the preaching of Jonah ; but now something greater than Jonah is here .
42011033	No man , when the light has been lighted , puts it in a secret place , or under a vessel , but on its table , so that those who come in may see the light .
42011034	The light of the body is the eye : when your eye is true , all your body is full of light ; but when it is evil , your body is dark .
42011035	So take care that the light which is in you is not dark .
42011036	If , then , all your body is light , with no part of it dark , it will be completely full of light , as when a flame with its bright shining gives you light .
42011037	Now , while he was talking , a Pharisee made a request that he would come to a meal with him ; and he went in and took his seat at the meal .
42011038	And when the Pharisee saw it , he was surprised because he came to the meal without first washing himself .
42011039	And the Lord said to him , You Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the plate clean ; but inside you are thieves and full of evil .
42011040	O you foolish ones ! did not he who made the outside in the same way make the inside ?
42011041	But if you give to the poor such things as you are able , then all things are clean to you .
42011042	But a curse is on you , Pharisees ! for you make men give a tenth of every sort of plant , and give no thought to right and the love of God ; but it is right for you to do these things , and not let the others be undone .
42011043	A curse is on you , Pharisees ! for your desires are for the most important seats in the Synagogues and for words of respect said to you in the market-place .
42011044	A curse is on you ! for you are like the resting-places of dead men , which are not seen , and men go walking over them without knowledge of it .
42011045	And one of the teachers of the law , answering , said to him , Master , in saying this , you give a bad name to us as to them .
42011046	And he said , A curse is on you , teachers of the law ! for while other men are crushed under the weight of the rules you make for them , you yourselves do not put so much as one finger to them .
42011047	A curse is on you ! for you make resting-places for the bodies of the prophets , but your fathers put them to death .
42011048	So you are witnesses and give approval to the work of your fathers ; for they put them to death and you make their last resting-places .
42011049	For this reason the wisdom of God has said , I will send them prophets and teachers , and to some of them they will give death and cruel pains ;
42011050	So that punishment may come on this generation for the blood of all the prophets which was given from the earliest days ;
42011051	From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah , who was put to death between the altar and the Temple . Yes , I say to you , It will come on this generation .
42011052	A curse is on you , teachers of the law ! for you have taken away the key of knowledge : you did not go in yourselves , and you got in the way of those who were going in .
42011053	And when he had come out of that place , the scribes and the Pharisees came round him angrily , questioning him about more things ;
42011054	And watching him , for a chance to get something from his words which might be used against him .
42012001	At that time , when thousands of the people had come together , in such numbers that they were crushing one another , he said first to his disciples , Have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees , which is deceit .
42012002	But nothing is covered up , which will not come to light , or secret , which will not be made clear .
42012003	So , whatever you have said in the dark , will come to men's hearing in the light , and what you have said secretly inside the house , will be made public from the house-tops .
42012004	And I say to you , my friends , Have no fear of those who may put the body to death , and are able to do no more than that .
42012005	But I will make clear to you of whom you are to be in fear : of him who after death has power to send you to hell ; yes , truly I say , Have fear of him .
42012006	Are not five sparrows given in exchange for two farthings ? and God has every one of them in mind .
42012007	But even the hairs of your head are numbered . Have no fear : you are of more value than a flock of sparrows .
42012008	And I say to you that to everyone who gives witness to me before men , the Son of man will give witness before the angels of God .
42012009	But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me , I will say that I have no knowledge of him before the angels of God .
42012010	And if anyone says a word against the Son of man , he will have forgiveness : but for him who says evil words against the Holy Spirit , there will be no forgiveness .
42012011	And when they take you before the Synagogues and the authorities and the rulers , take no thought about what answers you will give , or what you will say :
42012012	For the Holy Spirit will make clear to you in that very hour what to say .
42012013	And one of the people said to him , Master , give an order to my brother to make division of the heritage with me .
42012014	But he said , Man , who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you ?
42012015	And he said to them , Take care to keep yourselves free from the desire for property ; for a man's life is not made up of the number of things which he has .
42012016	And he said to them , in a story , The land of a certain man of great wealth was very fertile :
42012017	And he said to himself , What is to be done ? for I have no place in which to put all my fruit .
42012018	And he said , This I will do : I will take down my store-houses and make greater ones , and there I will put all my grain and my goods .
42012019	And I will say to my soul , Soul , you have a great amount of goods in store , enough for a number of years ; be at rest , take food and wine and be happy .
42012020	But God said to him , You foolish one , tonight I will take your soul from you , and who then will be the owner of all the things which you have got together ?
42012021	So that is what comes to the man who gets wealth for himself , and has not wealth in the eyes of God .
42012022	And he said to his disciples , For this reason I say to you , Take no thought for your life , about what food you will take , or for your body , how it may be clothed .
42012023	Is not life more than food , and the body than its clothing ?
42012024	Give thought to the ravens ; they do not put seeds into the earth , or get together grain ; they have no store-houses or buildings ; and God gives them their food : of how much greater value are you than the birds !
42012025	And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself any taller ?
42012026	If , then , you are not able to do even that which is least , why are you troubled about the rest ?
42012027	Give thought to the flowers : they do no work , they make no thread ; and still I say to you , Even Solomon , in all his glory , was not clothed like one of these .
42012028	But if God gives such clothing to the grass in the field , which today is living , and tomorrow will be burned in the oven , how much more will he give clothing to you , O men of little faith ?
42012029	And do not give overmuch thought to your food and drink , and let not your mind be full of doubts .
42012030	For the nations of the world go in search of all these things : but your Father has knowledge that you have need of them .
42012031	But let your chief care be for his kingdom , and these other things will be given to you in addition .
42012032	Have no fear , little flock , for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
42012033	Give what property you have in exchange for money , and give the money to the poor ; make for yourselves money-bags which will not get old , wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever , where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction .
42012034	For where your wealth is , there will your heart be .
42012035	Be ready , dressed as for a journey , with your lights burning .
42012036	And be like men who are looking for their lord , when he comes back from the bride-feast ; so that when he comes to the door , it will be open to him quickly .
42012037	Happy are those servants who are watching when the lord comes ; truly I say to you , he will make himself their servant and , placing them at the table , he will come out and give them food .
42012038	And if he comes in the second division of the night or in the third , and they are watching for him , happy are those servants .
42012039	But be certain of this , that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming , he would have been watching , and would not have let his house be broken into .
42012040	So be ready : for the Son of man is coming at a time when you are not looking for him .
42012041	And Peter said to him , Lord , are these words said to us only , or to all men ?
42012042	And the Lord said , Who then is the wise and responsible servant whom his lord will put in control of his family , to give them their food at the right time ?
42012043	Happy is that servant who , when his lord comes , is doing so .
42012044	Truly I say to you , he will put him in control of all his goods .
42012045	But if that servant says to himself , My lord is a long time coming ; and goes about giving blows to the men-servants and the women-servants , feasting and taking overmuch wine ;
42012046	The lord of that servant will come at a time when he is not looking for him , and at an hour when he is not ready for him , and he will have him cut in two and will give him his part in the fate of those who have no faith ;
42012047	And the servant who had knowledge of his lord's desires and was not ready for him and did not do as he was ordered , will be given a great number of blows ;
42012048	But he who , without knowledge , did things for which punishment is given , will get only a small number of blows . The man to whom much is given , will have to give much ; if much is given into his care , of him more will be requested .
42012049	I came to send a fire on the earth , and it may even now have been lighted .
42012050	But there is a baptism which I have to undergo ; and how am I kept back till it is complete !
42012051	Is it your opinion that I have come to give peace on earth ? I say to you , No , but division :
42012052	For from this time , a family of five in one house will be on opposite sides , three against two and two against three .
42012053	They will be at war , the father against his son , and the son against his father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against mother ; mother-in-law against daughter-in-law , and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law .
42012054	Then he said to the people , When you see a cloud coming up in the west , straight away you say , There will be rain ; and so it is .
42012055	And when you see a south wind blowing , you say , There will be heat ; and so it is .
42012056	O false ones ! the face of the earth and the heaven is clear to you ; how is it that the signs of these times are not as clear to you ?
42012057	And why are you , in your hearts , unable to be judges of what is right ?
42012058	For if anyone has a cause at law against you , and you are going with him before the ruler , make an attempt , on the way , to come to an agreement with him , for if you do not , he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police , and they will put you in prison .
42012059	I say to you , You will not come out of it till you have made payment to the very last farthing .
42013001	Now some people who were there at that time , gave him an account of how the blood of some Galilaeans had been mixed by Pilate with their offerings .
42013002	And he , in answer , said to them , Are you of the opinion that these Galilaeans were worse than all other Galilaeans , because these things were done to them ?
42013003	I say to you , It is not so : but if your hearts are not changed , you will all come to the same end .
42013004	Or those eighteen men who were crushed by the fall of the tower of Siloam , were they worse than all the other men living in Jerusalem ?
42013005	I say to you , It is not so : but if your hearts are not changed , you will all come to an end in the same way .
42013006	And he made up this story for them : A certain man had a fig-tree in his garden , and he came to get fruit from it , and there was no fruit .
42013007	And he said to the gardener , See , for three years I have been looking for fruit from this tree , and I have not had any : let it be cut down ; why is it taking up space ?
42013008	And he said , Lord , let it be for this year , and I will have the earth turned up round it , and put animal waste on it , to make it fertile :
42013009	And if , after that , it has fruit , it is well ; if not , let it be cut down .
42013010	And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath .
42013011	And there was a woman who had had a disease for eighteen years ; she was bent , and was not able to make herself straight .
42013012	And when Jesus saw her , he said to her , Woman , you are made free from your disease .
42013013	And he put his hands on her , and she was made straight , and gave praise to God .
42013014	And the ruler of the Synagogue was angry because Jesus had made her well on the Sabbath , and he said to the people , There are six days in which men may do work : so come on those days to be made well , and not on the Sabbath .
42013015	But the Lord gave him an answer and said , O you false men ! do you not , every one of you , on the Sabbath , let loose his ox and his ass and take it to the water ?
42013016	And is it not right for this daughter of Abraham , who has been in the power of Satan for eighteen years , to be made free on the Sabbath ?
42013017	And when he said these things , those who were against him were shamed , and all the people were full of joy because of the great things which were done by him .
42013018	Then he said , What is the kingdom of God like ? what comparison may I make of it ?
42013019	It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden , and it became a tree , and the birds of heaven made their resting-places in its branches .
42013020	And again he said , What is the kingdom of God like ?
42013021	It is like leaven , which a woman put into three measures of meal , and it was all leavened .
42013022	And he went on his way , through towns and country places , teaching and journeying to Jerusalem .
42013023	And someone said to him , Lord , will only a small number have salvation ? And he said to them ,
42013024	Do your best to go in by the narrow door , for I say to you , A number will make the attempt to go in , but will not be able to do so .
42013025	When the master of the house has got up , and the door has been shut , and you , still outside , give blows on the door , saying , Lord , let us in ; he will make answer and say , I have no knowledge of where you come from .
42013026	Then you will say , We have taken food and drink with you , and you were teaching in our streets .
42013027	But he will say , Truly , I have no knowledge of you or where you come from ; go away from me , you workers of evil .
42013028	There will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , but you yourselves are shut outside .
42013029	And they will come from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south , and take their places in the kingdom of God .
42013030	And the last will be first , and the first will be last .
42013031	At that time , certain Pharisees came to him and said , Go away from this place , because Herod's purpose is to put you to death .
42013032	And he said , Go and say to that fox , I send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow , and on the third day my work will be complete .
42013033	But I have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day , for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside Jerusalem .
42013034	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , putting to death the prophets , and stoning those who were sent to her ! again and again would I have taken your children to myself , as a bird takes her young ones under her wings , but you would not !
42013035	Now see , your house is waste , and I say to you , You will not see me again till you say , A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord .
42014001	And it came about that when he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the Sabbath , to have a meal , they were watching him .
42014002	And a certain man was there who had a disease .
42014003	And Jesus , answering , said to the scribes and Pharisees , Is it right to make people well on the Sabbath or not ?
42014004	But they said nothing . And he made him well and sent him away .
42014005	And he said to them , Which of you , whose ox or ass has got into a water-hole , will not straight away get him out on the Sabbath ?
42014006	And they had no answer to that question .
42014007	And he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast , when he saw how they took the best seats ; saying to them ,
42014008	When you get a request to come to a feast , do not take the best seat , for a more important man than you may be coming ,
42014009	And then the giver of the feast will come to you and say , Give your place to this man ; and you , with shame , will have to take the lowest seat .
42014010	But when you come , go and take the lowest seat , so that when the giver of the feast comes , he may say to you , Friend , come up higher ; and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there .
42014011	For every man who gives himself a high place will be put down , but he who takes a low place will be lifted up .
42014012	And he said to the master of the house , When you give a feast , do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth , for they may give a feast for you , and so you will get a reward .
42014013	But when you give a feast , send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body :
42014014	And you will have a blessing , because they will not be able to give you any payment , and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead .
42014015	And , hearing these words , one of those who were at table with him said to him , Happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of God .
42014016	And he said to them , A certain man gave a great feast , and sent word of it to a number of people .
42014017	And when the time had come , he sent his servants to say to them , Come , for all things are now ready .
42014018	And they all gave reasons why they were not able to come . The first said to him , I have got a new field , and it is necessary for me to go and see it : I am full of regret that I am unable to come .
42014019	And another said , I have got some cattle , and I am going to make a test of them : I am full of regret that I am unable to come .
42014020	And another said , I have been married , and so I am not able to come .
42014021	And the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things . Then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant , Go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor , the blind , and those who are broken in body .
42014022	And the servant said , Lord , your orders have been done , and still there is room .
42014023	And the lord said to the servant , Go out into the roads and the fields , and make them come in , so that my house may be full .
42014024	For I say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast .
42014025	Now a great number of people went with him .
42014026	And turning round , he said to them , If any man comes to me , and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , and even for his life , he may not be my disciple .
42014027	Whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple .
42014028	For which of you , desiring to put up a tower , does not first give much thought to the price , if he will have enough to make it complete ?
42014029	For fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end , all who see it will be laughing at him ,
42014030	And saying , This man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete .
42014031	Or what king , going to war with another king , will not first take thought if he will be strong enough , with ten thousand men , to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
42014032	Or while the other is still a great distance away , he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace .
42014033	And so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple .
42014034	For salt is good , but if the taste goes from it , of what use is it ?
42014035	It is no good for the land or for the place of waste ; no one has a use for it . He who has ears , let him give ear .
42015001	Now all the tax-farmers and sinners came near to give ear to him .
42015002	And the Pharisees and scribes were angry , saying , This man gives approval to sinners , and takes food with them .
42015003	And he made a story for them , saying ,
42015004	What man of you , having a hundred sheep , if one of them gets loose and goes away , will not let the ninety-nine be in the waste land by themselves , and go after the wandering one , till he sees where it is ?
42015005	And when he has got it again , he takes it in his arms with joy .
42015006	And when he gets back to his house , he sends for his neighbours and friends , saying to them , Be glad with me , for I have got back my sheep which had gone away .
42015007	I say to you that even so there will be more joy in heaven when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing , than for ninety-nine good men , who have no need of a change of heart .
42015008	Or what woman , having ten bits of silver , if one bit has gone from her hands , will not get a light , and go through her house , searching with care till she sees it ?
42015009	And when she has it again , she gets her friends and neighbours together , saying , Be glad with me , for I have got back the bit of silver which had gone from me .
42015010	Even so , I say to you , There is joy among the angels of God , when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing .
42015011	And he said , A certain man had two sons :
42015012	And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me that part of your property which will be mine . And he made division of his goods between them .
42015013	And not long after , the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far-away country , and there all his money went in foolish living .
42015014	And when everything was gone , there was no food to be had in that country , and he was in need .
42015015	And he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country , and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food .
42015016	And so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs ' food , and no one gave him anything .
42015017	But when he came to his senses , he said , What numbers of my father's servants have bread enough , and more , while I am near to death here through need of food !
42015018	I will get up and go to my father , and will say to him , Father , I have done wrong , against heaven and in your eyes :
42015019	I am no longer good enough to be named your son : make me like one of your servants .
42015020	And he got up and went to his father . But while he was still far away , his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss .
42015021	And his son said to him , Father , I have done wrong , against heaven and in your eyes : I am no longer good enough to be named your son .
42015022	But the father said to his servants , Get out the first robe quickly , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet :
42015023	And get the fat young ox and put it to death , and let us have a feast , and be glad .
42015024	For this , my son , who was dead , is living again ; he had gone away from me , and has come back . And they were full of joy .
42015025	Now the older son was in the field : and when he came near the house , the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears .
42015026	And he sent for one of the servants , questioning him about what it might be .
42015027	And he said to him , Your brother has come ; and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely .
42015028	But he was angry and would not go in ; and his father came out and made a request to him to come in .
42015029	But he made answer and said to his father , See , all these years I have been your servant , doing your orders in everything : and you never gave me even a young goat so that I might have a feast with my friends :
42015030	But when this your son came , who has been wasting your property with bad women , you put to death the fat young ox for him .
42015031	And he said to him , Son , you are with me at all times , and all I have is yours .
42015032	But it was right to be glad and to have a feast ; for this your brother , who was dead , is living again ; he had gone away and has come back .
42016001	And another time he said to the disciples , There was a certain man of great wealth who had a servant ; and it was said to him that this servant was wasting his goods .
42016002	And he sent for him and said , What is this which is said about you ? give me an account of all you have done , for you will no longer be the manager of my property .
42016003	And the servant said to himself , What am I to do now that my lord takes away my position ? I have not enough strength for working in the fields , and I would be shamed if I made requests for money from people in the streets .
42016004	I have come to a decision what to do , so that when I am put out of my position they will take me into their houses .
42016005	And sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first , What is the amount of your debt to my lord ?
42016006	And he said , A hundred measures of oil . And he said , Take your account straight away and put down fifty .
42016007	Then he said to another , What is the amount of your debt ? And he said , A hundred measures of grain . And he said to him , Take your account and put down eighty .
42016008	And his lord was pleased with the false servant , because he had been wise ; for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light .
42016009	And I say to you , Make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life , so that when it comes to an end , you may be taken into the eternal resting-places .
42016010	He who is true in a little , is true in much ; he who is false in small things , is false in great .
42016011	If , then , you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life , who will give into your care the true wealth ?
42016012	And if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people , who will give you that which is yours ?
42016013	No man may be a servant to two masters : for he will have hate for the one and love for the other ; or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other . You may not be servants of God and of wealth .
42016014	And the Pharisees , who had a great love of money , hearing these things , were making sport of him .
42016015	And he said , You take care to seem right in the eyes of men , but God sees your hearts : and those things which are important in the opinion of men , are evil in the eyes of God .
42016016	The law and the prophets were till John : but then came the preaching of the kingdom of God , and everyone makes his way into it by force .
42016017	But heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out .
42016018	Everyone who puts away his wife and takes another , is a false husband : and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away , is no true husband to her .
42016019	Now there was a certain man of great wealth , who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen , and was shining and glad every day .
42016020	And a certain poor man , named Lazarus , was stretched out at his door , full of wounds ,
42016021	Desiring the broken bits of food which came from the table of the man of wealth ; and even the dogs came and put their tongues on his wounds .
42016022	And in time the poor man came to his end , and angels took him to Abraham's breast . And the man of wealth came to his end , and was put in the earth .
42016023	And in hell , being in great pain , lifting up his eyes he saw Abraham , far away , and Lazarus on his breast .
42016024	And he gave a cry and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me and send Lazarus , so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue , for I am cruelly burning in this flame .
42016025	But Abraham said , Keep in mind , my son , that when you were living , you had your good things , while Lazarus had evil things : but now , he is comforted and you are in pain .
42016026	And in addition , there is a deep division fixed between us and you , so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so , and no one may come from you to us .
42016027	And he said , Father , it is my request that you will send him to my father's house ;
42016028	For I have five brothers ; and let him give them an account of these things , so that they may not come to this place of pain .
42016029	But Abraham said , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them give ear to what they say .
42016030	And he said , No , father Abraham , but if someone went to them from the dead , their hearts would be changed .
42016031	And he said to him , If they will not give attention to Moses and the prophets , they will not be moved even if someone comes back from the dead .
42017001	And he said to his disciples , It is necessary for causes of trouble to come about , but unhappy is he by whom they come .
42017002	It would be well for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea , before he made trouble for any of these little ones .
42017003	Give attention to yourselves : if your brother does wrong , say a sharp word to him ; and if he has sorrow for his sin , let him have forgiveness .
42017004	And if he does you wrong seven times in a day , and seven times comes to you and says , I have regret for what I have done ; let him have forgiveness .
42017005	And the twelve said to the Lord , Make our faith greater .
42017006	And the Lord said , If your faith was only as great as a grain of mustard seed , you might say to this tree , Be rooted up and planted in the sea ; and it would be done .
42017007	But which of you , having a servant who is ploughing or keeping sheep , will say to him , when he comes in from the field , Come now and be seated and have a meal ,
42017008	Will he not say , Get a meal for me , and make yourself ready and see to my needs till I have had my food and drink ; and after that you may have yours ?
42017009	Does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered ?
42017010	In the same way , when you have done all the things which are given you to do , say , There is no profit in us , for we have only done what we were ordered to do .
42017011	And it came about that when they were on the way to Jerusalem he went through Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	And when he went into a certain small town he came across ten men who were lepers , and they , keeping themselves at a distance ,
42017013	Said , in loud voices , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
42017014	And when he saw them he said , Go , and let the priests see you . And , while they were going , they were made clean .
42017015	And one of them , when he saw that he was clean , turning back , gave praise to God in a loud voice ;
42017016	And , falling down on his face at the feet of Jesus , he gave the credit to him ; and he was a man of Samaria .
42017017	And Jesus said , Were there not ten men who were made clean ? where are the nine ?
42017018	Have not any of them come back to give glory to God , but only this one from a strange land ?
42017019	And he said to him , Get up , and go on your way ; your faith has made you well .
42017020	And when the Pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of God would come , he gave them an answer and said , The kingdom of God will not come through observation :
42017021	And men will not say , See , it is here ! or , There ! for the kingdom of God is among you .
42017022	And he said to his disciples , The time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , but you will not see it .
42017023	And if they say to you , See , it is there ! or , It is here ! do not go away , or go after them .
42017024	For as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other , so will the Son of man be when his time comes .
42017025	But first , he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation .
42017026	And as it was in the days of Noah , so will it be in the day of the Son of man .
42017027	They were feasting and taking wives and getting married , till the day of the overflowing of the waters , when Noah went into the ark , and they all came to destruction .
42017028	In the same way , in the days of Lot ; they were feasting and trading , they were planting and building ;
42017029	But on the day when Lot went out of Sodom , fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all .
42017030	So will it be in the day of the revelation of the Son of man .
42017031	On that day , if anyone is on the roof of the house , and his goods are in the house , let him not go down to take them away ; and let him who is in the field not go back to his house .
42017032	Keep in mind Lot's wife .
42017033	If anyone makes an attempt to keep his life , it will be taken from him , but if anyone gives up his life , he will keep it .
42017034	I say to you , In that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed , and one will be taken away and the other let go .
42017035	Two women will be crushing grain together ; one will be taken away and the other let go .
42017037	And they , answering him , said , Where , Lord ? And he said to them , Where the body is , there will the eagles come together .
42018001	And he made a story for them , the point of which was that men were to go on making prayer and not get tired ;
42018002	Saying , There was a judge in a certain town , who had no fear of God or respect for man :
42018003	And there was a widow in that town , and she kept on coming to him and saying , Give me my right against the man who has done me wrong .
42018004	And for a time he would not : but later , he said to himself , Though I have no fear of God or respect for man ,
42018005	Because this widow is a trouble to me , I will give her her right ; for if not , I will be completely tired out by her frequent coming .
42018006	And the Lord said , Give ear to the words of the evil judge .
42018007	And will not God do right in the cause of his saints , whose cries come day and night to his ears , though he is long in doing it ?
42018008	I say to you that he will quickly do right in their cause . But when the Son of man comes , will there be any faith on earth ?
42018009	And he made this story for some people who were certain that they were good , and had a low opinion of others :
42018010	Two men went up to the Temple for prayer ; one a Pharisee , and the other a tax-farmer .
42018011	The Pharisee , taking up his position , said to himself these words : God , I give you praise because I am not like other men , who take more than their right , who are evil-doers , who are untrue to their wives , or even like this tax-farmer .
42018012	Twice in the week I go without food ; I give a tenth of all I have .
42018013	The tax-farmer , on the other hand , keeping far away , and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven , made signs of grief and said , God , have mercy on me , a sinner .
42018014	I say to you , This man went back to his house with God's approval , and not the other : for everyone who makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high .
42018015	And they took their children to him , so that he might put his hands on them : but when the disciples saw it , they said sharp words to them
42018016	But Jesus sent for them , saying , Let the children come to me , and do not keep them away , for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
42018017	Truly I say to you , Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child , will not come into it at all .
42018018	And a certain ruler put a question to him , saying , Good Master , what have I to do so that I may have eternal life ?
42018019	And Jesus said to him , Why do you say that I am good ? No one is good , but only God .
42018020	You have knowledge of what the law says : Do not be untrue to your wife , Do not put anyone to death , Do not take what is not yours , Do not give false witness , Give honour to your father and mother .
42018021	And he said , All these things I have done from the time when I was a boy .
42018022	And Jesus , hearing it , said to him , One thing you still have need of ; get money for your goods , and give it away to the poor , and you will have wealth in heaven ; and come after me .
42018023	But at these words he became very sad , for he had great wealth .
42018024	And Jesus , looking at him , said , How hard it is for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God !
42018025	It is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of God .
42018026	And those who were present said , Then who may have salvation ?
42018027	But he said , Things which are not possible with man are possible with God .
42018028	And Peter said , See , we have given up what is ours to come after you .
42018029	And he said to them , Truly I say to you , There is no man who has given up house or wife or brothers or father or mother or children , because of the kingdom of God ,
42018030	Who will not get much more in this time , and in the world to come , eternal life .
42018031	And he took with him the twelve and said to them , Now we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things which were said by the prophets will be done to the Son of man .
42018032	For he will be given up to the Gentiles , and will be made sport of and put to shame :
42018033	And he will be given cruel blows and put to death , and on the third day he will come back to life .
42018034	But they did not take in the sense of any of these words , and what he said was not clear to them , and their minds were not able to see it .
42018035	And it came about that when he got near Jericho , a certain blind man was seated by the side of the road , making requests for money from those who went by .
42018036	And hearing the sound of a great number of people going by , he said , What is this ?
42018037	And they said to him , Jesus of Nazareth is going by .
42018038	And he said in a loud voice , Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me .
42018039	And those who were in front made protests and said to him , Be quiet : but he said all the more , O Son of David , have mercy on me .
42018040	And Jesus , stopping , gave orders that he was to come to him , and when he came near , he said to him ,
42018041	What would you have me do for you ? And he said , Lord , that I may be able to see again .
42018042	And Jesus said , See again : your faith has made you well .
42018043	And straight away he was able to see , and he went after him , giving glory to God ; and all the people when they saw it gave praise to God .
42019001	And he went into Jericho , and when he was going through it ,
42019002	A man , named Zacchaeus , who was the chief tax-farmer , and a man of wealth ,
42019003	Made an attempt to get a view of Jesus , and was not able to do so , because of the people , for he was a small man .
42019004	And he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him , for he was going that way .
42019005	And when Jesus came to the place , looking up , he said to him , Zacchaeus , be quick and come down , for I am coming to your house today .
42019006	And he came down quickly , and took him into his house with joy .
42019007	And when they saw it , they were all angry , saying , He has gone into the house of a sinner .
42019008	And Zacchaeus , waiting before him , said to the Lord , See , Lord , half of my goods I give to the poor , and if I have taken anything from anyone wrongly , I give him back four times as much .
42019009	And Jesus said to him , Today salvation has come to this house , for even he is a son of Abraham .
42019010	For the Son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way , and to be their Saviour .
42019011	And while they were giving ear to these words , he made another story for them , because he was near Jerusalem , and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of God was coming straight away .
42019012	So he said , A certain man of high birth went into a far-away country to get a kingdom for himself , and to come back .
42019013	And he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them , Do business with this till I come .
42019014	But his people had no love for him , and sent representatives after him , saying , We will not have this man for our ruler .
42019015	And when he came back again , having got his kingdom , he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him , so that he might have an account of what business they had done .
42019016	And the first came before him , saying , Lord , your pound has made ten pounds .
42019017	And he said to him , You have done well , O good servant : because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns .
42019018	And another came , saying , Your pound has made five pounds .
42019019	And he said , You will be ruler over five towns .
42019020	And another came , saying , Lord , here is your pound , which I put away in a cloth ;
42019021	Because I was in fear of you , for you are a hard man : you take up what you have not put down , and get in grain where you have not put seed .
42019022	He said to him , By the words of your mouth you will be judged , you bad servant . You had knowledge that I am a hard man , taking up what I have not put down and getting in grain where I have not put seed ;
42019023	Why then did you not put my money in a bank , so that when I came I would get it back with interest ?
42019024	And he said to the others who were near , Take the pound away from him , and give it to the man who has ten .
42019025	And they say to him , Lord , he has ten pounds .
42019026	And I say to you that to everyone who has , more will be given , but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
42019027	And as for those who were against me , who would not have me for their ruler , let them come here , and be put to death before me .
42019028	And when he had said this , he went on in front of them , going up to Jerusalem .
42019029	And it came about that when he got near Beth-phage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives , he sent two of the disciples ,
42019030	Saying , Go into the little town in front of you , and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord , on which no man has ever been seated ; let him loose and take him .
42019031	And if anyone says to you , Why are you taking him ? say , The Lord has need of him .
42019032	And those whom he sent went away , and it was as he said .
42019033	And when they were getting the young ass , the owners of it said to them , Why are you taking the young ass ?
42019034	And they said , The Lord has need of him .
42019035	And they took him to Jesus , and they put their clothing on the ass , and Jesus got on to him .
42019036	And while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him .
42019037	And when he came near the foot of the Mountain of Olives , all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to God with joy , because of all the great works which they had seen ;
42019038	Saying , A blessing on the King who comes in the name of the Lord ; peace in heaven and glory in the highest .
42019039	And some of the Pharisees among the people said to him , Master , make your disciples be quiet .
42019040	And he said in answer , I say to you , if these men keep quiet , the very stones will be crying out .
42019041	And when he got near and saw the town , he was overcome with weeping for it ,
42019042	Saying , If you , even you , had knowledge today , of the things which give peace ! but you are not able to see them .
42019043	For the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you , and come all round you and keep you in on every side ,
42019044	And will make you level with the earth , and your children with you ; and there will not be one stone resting on another in you , because you did not see that it was your day of mercy .
42019045	And he went into the Temple and put out those who were trading there ,
42019046	Saying to them , It has been said , My house is to be a house of prayer , but you have made it a hole of thieves .
42019047	And every day he was teaching in the Temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death ;
42019048	But they were not able to do anything , because the people all kept near him , being greatly interested in his words .
42020001	And it came about on one of those days , when he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the good news ,
42020002	That the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said , Make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority .
42020003	And in answer he said to them , I will put a question to you , and do you give me an answer :
42020004	The baptism of John , was it from heaven or of men ?
42020005	And they said among themselves , If we say , From heaven ; he will say , Why did you not have faith in him ?
42020006	But if we say , Of men ; we will be stoned by the people , for they are certain that John was a prophet .
42020007	And they made answer that they had no idea where it came from .
42020008	And Jesus said , And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things .
42020009	And he gave the people this story : A man made a vine-garden and gave the use of it to some field-workers and went into another country for a long time .
42020010	And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines ; but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing .
42020011	And he sent another servant , and they gave blows to him in the same way , and put shame on him , and sent him away with nothing .
42020012	And he sent a third , and they gave him wounds and put him out .
42020013	And the lord of the garden said , What am I to do ? I will send my dearly loved son ; they may give respect to him .
42020014	But when the workmen saw him , they said to one another , This is he who will one day be the owner of the property : let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours .
42020015	And driving him out of the garden they put him to death . Now what will the lord do to these workmen ?
42020016	He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others . And when he said this , they said , May it not be so .
42020017	But he , looking on them , said , Is it not in the Writings , The stone which the builders put on one side , the same has become the chief stone of the building ?
42020018	Everyone falling on that stone will be broken , but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust .
42020019	And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour ; and they were in fear of the people , for they saw that he had made up this story against them .
42020020	And they kept watch on him , and sent out secret representatives , who were acting the part of good men , in order that they might get something from his words , on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler .
42020021	And they put a question to him , saying , Master , we are certain that your teaching and your words are right , and that you have no respect for a man's position , but you are teaching the true way of God :
42020022	Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not ?
42020023	But he saw through their trick and said to them ,
42020024	Let me see a penny . Whose image and name are on it ? And they said , Caesar's .
42020025	And he said , Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's , and to God the things which are God's .
42020026	And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people : but they were full of wonder at his answer , and said nothing .
42020027	And some of the Sadducees came to him , who say that there is no coming back from the dead ; and they said to him ,
42020028	Master , Moses said that if a man's brother comes to his end , having a wife , but no children , his brother is to take the wife , and get a family for his brother .
42020029	Now there were seven brothers , and the first had a wife and came to his end , having no children ;
42020030	And the second ;
42020031	And the third took her ; and in the same way , all the seven , without having any children , came to their end .
42020032	And last of all , the woman came to her end .
42020033	When they come back from the dead , whose wife will she be ? for all the seven had her .
42020034	And Jesus said to them , The sons of this world are married and have wives ;
42020035	But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come , and to come back from the dead , have no wives , and are not married ;
42020036	And death has no more power over them , for they are equal to the angels , and are sons of God , being of those who will come back from the dead .
42020037	But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life , saying , in the story of the burning thorn-tree , The Lord , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
42020038	Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living : for all men are living to him .
42020039	And some of the scribes , in answer to this , said , Master , you have said well .
42020040	And they had fear of putting any more questions to him .
42020041	And he said to them , Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David ?
42020042	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , The Lord said to my Lord , Take your seat at my right hand ,
42020043	Till I put under your feet all those who are against you .
42020044	David then gives him the name of Lord , so how is it possible for him to be his son ?
42020045	And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples ,
42020046	Keep away from the scribes , whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes , and to have words of respect said to them in the market-places , and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts ;
42020047	Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers ; they will get a greater punishment .
42021001	And looking up , he saw the men of wealth putting their offerings in the money-box .
42021002	And he saw a certain poor widow putting in a farthing .
42021003	And he said , Truly I say to you , This poor widow has given more than all of them :
42021004	For they gave out of their wealth , having more than enough for themselves : but she , even out of her need , has put in all her living .
42021005	And some were talking about the Temple , how it was made fair with beautiful stones and with offerings , but he said ,
42021006	As for these things which you see , the days will come when not one stone will be resting on another , but all will be broken down .
42021007	And they said to him , Master , when will these things be ? and what sign will there be when these events are to take place ?
42021008	And he said , Take care that you are not tricked : for a number of people will come in my name , saying , I am he ; and , The time is near : do not go after them .
42021009	And when news of wars and troubled times comes to your ears , have no fear ; for these things have to be , but the end will not be now .
42021010	Then he said to them , Nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom :
42021011	There will be great earth-shocks and outbursts of disease in a number of places , and men will be without food ; and there will be wonders and great signs from heaven .
42021012	But before all this , they will take you and be very cruel to you , giving you up to the Synagogues and to prisons , taking you before kings and rulers , because of my name .
42021013	And it will be turned to a witness for you .
42021014	So take care not to be troubled before the time comes , about what answers you will give :
42021015	For I will give you words and wisdom , so that not one of those who are against you will be able to get the better of you , or to put you in the wrong .
42021016	But you will be given up even by your fathers and mothers , your brothers and relations and friends ; and some of you will be put to death .
42021017	And you will be hated by all men , because of me .
42021018	But not a hair of your head will come to destruction .
42021019	By going through all these things , you will keep your lives .
42021020	But when you see armies all round about Jerusalem , then be certain that her destruction is near .
42021021	Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains ; and those who are in the middle of the town go out ; and let not those who are in the country come in .
42021022	For these are the days of punishment , in which all the things in the Writings will be put into effect .
42021023	It will be hard for women who are with child , and for her with a baby at the breast , in those days . For great trouble will come on the land , and wrath on this people .
42021024	And they will be put to death with the sword , and will be taken as prisoners into all the nations ; and Jerusalem will be crushed under the feet of the Gentiles , till the times of the Gentiles are complete .
42021025	And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars ; and on the earth , fear among the nations and doubt because of the loud noise of the sea and the waves ;
42021026	Men's strength will go from them in fear and in waiting for the things which are coming on the earth ; for the powers of the heavens will be moved .
42021027	And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud , with power and great glory .
42021028	But when these things come about , let your heads be lifted up , because your salvation is near .
42021029	And he made a story for them : See the fig-tree , and all the trees ;
42021030	When they put out their young leaves , you take note of it , and it is clear to you that summer is coming .
42021031	In the same way , when you see these things taking place you may be certain that the kingdom of God is near .
42021032	Truly I say to you , This generation will not come to an end till all things are complete .
42021033	Heaven and earth will come to an end , but my words will not come to an end .
42021034	But give attention to yourselves , for fear that your hearts become over-full of the pleasures of food and wine , and the cares of this life , and that day may come on you suddenly , and take you as in a net :
42021035	For so it will come on all those who are living on the face of all the earth .
42021036	But keep watch at all times with prayer , that you may be strong enough to come through all these things and take your place before the Son of man .
42021037	And every day he was teaching in the Temple and every night he went out to the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives to take his rest .
42021038	And all the people came early in the morning to give ear to his words in the Temple .
42022001	Now the feast of unleavened bread was near , which is called the Passover .
42022002	And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a chance to put him to death , but they went in fear of the people .
42022003	And Satan came into Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve .
42022004	And he went away and had a discussion with the chief priests and the rulers , about how he might give him up to them .
42022005	And they were glad , and undertook to give him money .
42022006	And he made an agreement with them to give him up to them , if he got a chance , when the people were not present .
42022007	And the day of unleavened bread came , when the Passover lamb is put to death .
42022008	And Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , Go and make the Passover ready for us , so that we may take it .
42022009	And they said to him , Where are we to get it ready ?
42022010	And he said to them , When you go into the town you will see a man coming to you with a vessel of water ; go after him into the house into which he goes .
42022011	And say to the master of the house , The Master says , Where is the guest-room , where I may take the Passover with my disciples ?
42022012	And he will take you up to a great room with a table and seats : there make ready .
42022013	And they went , and it was as he had said : and they made the Passover ready .
42022014	And when the time had come , he took his seat , and the Apostles with him .
42022015	And he said , I have had a great desire to keep this Passover with you before I come to my death ;
42022016	For I say to you , I will not take it till it is made complete in the kingdom of God .
42022017	And he took a cup and , having given praise , he said , Make division of this among yourselves ;
42022018	For I say to you , I will not take of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of God has come .
42022019	And he took bread and , having given praise , he gave it to them when it had been broken , saying , This is my body , which is given for you : do this in memory of me .
42022020	And in the same way , after the meal , he took the cup , saying , This cup is the new testament , made with my blood which is given for you .
42022021	But the hand of him who is false to me is with me at the table .
42022022	For it will be done to the Son of man after the purpose of God , but unhappy is that man by whom he is given up .
42022023	And they were wondering among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing .
42022024	And there was an argument among them about which of them was the greatest .
42022025	And he said , The kings of the Gentiles are lords over them , and those who have authority are given names of honour .
42022026	But let it not be so with you ; but he who is greater , let him become like the younger ; and he who is chief , like a servant .
42022027	For which is greater , the guest who is seated at a meal or the servant who is waiting on him ? is it not the guest ? but I am among you as a servant .
42022028	But you are those who have kept with me through my troubles ;
42022029	And I will give you a kingdom as my Father has given one to me ,
42022030	So that you may take food and drink at my table in my kingdom , and be seated like kings , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
42022031	Simon , Simon , Satan has made a request to have you , so that he may put you to the test as grain is tested :
42022032	But I have made prayer for you , that your faith may not go from you : and when you are turned again , make your brothers strong .
42022033	And he said to him , Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death .
42022034	And he said , I say to you , Peter , before the cock's second cry today , you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me .
42022035	And he said to them , When I sent you out without money or bag or shoes , were you in need of anything ? And they said , Nothing .
42022036	And he said to them , But now , he who has a money-bag , or a bag for food , let him take it : and he who has not , let him give his coat for money and get a sword .
42022037	For I say to you that these words will be put into effect in me , And he was numbered among the evil-doers : for what has been said in the Writings about me has an end .
42022038	And they said , Lord , here are two swords . And he said , It is enough .
42022039	And he came out , and went , as his way was , to the Mountain of Olives , and the disciples went with him .
42022040	And when he came to the place , he said to them , Make a prayer that you may not be put to the test .
42022041	And he went a little distance away from them and , falling on his knees in prayer , he said ,
42022042	Father , if it is your pleasure , take this cup from me : but still , let your pleasure , not mine , be done .
42022043	And an angel from heaven came to him , to give him strength .
42022044	And being in great trouble of soul , the force of his prayer became stronger , and great drops , like blood , came from him , falling to the earth .
42022045	And , getting up from prayer , he came to the disciples , and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow .
42022046	And he said , Why are you sleeping ? Get up , and give yourselves to prayer , so that you may not be put to the test .
42022047	And while he was saying these words , there came a band of people , and Judas , one of the twelve , was in front of them , and he came near to Jesus to give him a kiss .
42022048	But Jesus said to him , Judas , will you be false to the Son of man with a kiss ?
42022049	And when those who were with him saw what was coming , they said , Lord , may we not make use of our swords ?
42022050	And one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest , cutting off his right ear .
42022051	But Jesus , answering , said , Put up with this , at least . And touching his ear , he made it well .
42022052	And Jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the Temple and the rulers , who had come against him , Have you come out as against a thief , with swords and sticks ?
42022053	When I was in the Temple with you every day , your hands were not stretched out against me : but this is your hour , and the authority of the dark power .
42022054	And they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest . But Peter went after them at a distance .
42022055	And a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square , and they were seated together , and Peter was among them .
42022056	And a certain woman-servant , seeing him in the light of the fire , and looking at him with attention , said , This man was with him .
42022057	But he said , Woman , it is not true ; I have no knowledge of him .
42022058	And after a little time , another saw him and said , You are one of them ; and he said , Man , I am not .
42022059	And after about an hour , another man said , with decision , Certainly this man was with him , for he is a Galilaean .
42022060	And Peter said , Man , I have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking . And straight away , while he was saying these words , there came the cry of a cock .
42022061	And the Lord , turning , gave Peter a look . And the words of the Lord came to Peter's mind , how he had said , This night , before the hour of the cock's cry , you will be false to me three times .
42022062	And he went out , weeping bitterly .
42022063	And the men in whose hands Jesus was , made sport of him and gave him blows .
42022064	And , covering his eyes , they said to him , Are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow ?
42022065	And they said a number of other evil things against him .
42022066	And when it was day , the rulers of the people came together , with the chief priests and the scribes , and they took him before their Sanhedrin , saying ,
42022067	If you are the Christ , say so . But he said , If I say so you will not have belief ;
42022068	And if I put a question to you , you will not give an answer .
42022069	But in the future the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God .
42022070	And they all said , Are you then the Son of God ? and he said , You say that I am .
42022071	And they said , What more need have we of witness ? we have the very words of his mouth .
42023001	And they all went and took him before Pilate .
42023002	And they made statements against him , saying , This man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong , and not to make payment of taxes to Caesar , even saying that he himself is Christ , a king .
42023003	And Pilate said to him , Are you the King of the Jews ? And he said in answer , You say so .
42023004	And Pilate said to the chief priests and the people , In my opinion this man has done no wrong .
42023005	But they became more violent than before , saying , He has made trouble among the people , teaching through all Judaea from Galilee to this place .
42023006	But at these words Pilate said , Is the man a Galilaean ?
42023007	And when he saw that he was under the authority of Herod , he sent him to Herod , who was in Jerusalem himself at that time .
42023008	Now when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad , having for a long time had a desire to see him , for he had had accounts of him , and was hoping to see some wonders done by him .
42023009	And he put a great number of questions to him , but he said nothing .
42023010	And the chief priests and the scribes were there , making statements against him violently .
42023011	And Herod , with the men of his army , put shame on him and made sport of him , and dressing him in shining robes , he sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	And that day Herod and Pilate became friends with one another , for before they had been against one another .
42023013	And Pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people , and said to them ,
42023014	You say that this man has been teaching the people evil things : now I , after going into the question before you , see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him :
42023015	And Herod is of the same opinion , for he has sent him back to us ; for , you see , he has done nothing for which I might put him to death .
42023016	And so I will give him punishment and let him go .
42023018	But with loud voices they said all together , Put this man to death , and make Barabbas free .
42023019	Now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town , in which there had been loss of life .
42023020	And Pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let Jesus go free .
42023021	But crying out they said , To the cross with him !
42023022	And he said to them a third time , Why , what evil has he done ? I see no reason for putting him to death : I will give him punishment and let him go .
42023023	But they went on crying out loudly , Let him be put to death on the cross . And they had their way .
42023024	And Pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect .
42023025	And in answer to their request , he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death , and Jesus he gave up to their pleasure .
42023026	And while they were taking him away , they put their hands on Simon of Cyrene , who was coming from the country , and made him take the cross after Jesus .
42023027	And a great band of people went after him , and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him .
42023028	But Jesus , turning to them , said , Daughters of Jerusalem , let not your weeping be for me , but for yourselves and for your children .
42023029	For the days are coming in which they will say , Happy are those who have had no children , whose bodies have never given birth , whose breasts have never given milk .
42023030	And they will say to the mountains , Come down on us , and to the hills , Be a cover over us .
42023031	For if they do these things when the tree is green , what will they do when it is dry ?
42023032	And two others , evil-doers , were taken with him to be put to death .
42023033	And when they came to the place which is named Golgotha , they put him on the cross , and the evil-doers , one on the right side , and the other on the left .
42023034	And Jesus said , Father , let them have forgiveness , for they have no knowledge of what they are doing . And they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance .
42023035	And the people were looking on . And the rulers made sport of him , saying , He was a saviour of others ; let him do something for himself , if he is the Christ , the man of God's selection .
42023036	And the men of the army made sport of him , coming to him and giving him bitter wine ,
42023037	And saying , If you are the King of the Jews , get yourself free .
42023038	And these words were put in writing over him , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
42023039	And one of the evil-doers on the cross , with bitter feeling , said to him , Are you not the Christ ? Get yourself and us out of this .
42023040	But the other , protesting , said , Have you no fear of God ? for you have a part in the same punishment ,
42023041	And with reason ; for we have the right reward of our acts , but this man has done nothing wrong .
42023042	And he said , Jesus , keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom .
42023043	And he said to him , Truly I say to you , Today you will be with me in Paradise .
42023044	And it was now about the sixth hour ; and all the land was dark till the ninth hour ;
42023045	The light of the sun went out , and the curtain in the Temple was parted in two .
42023046	And Jesus gave a loud cry and said , Father , into your hands I give my spirit : and when he had said this , he gave up his spirit .
42023047	And when the captain saw what was done , he gave praise to God , saying , Without doubt this was an upright man .
42023048	And all the people who had come together to see it , when they saw the things which were done , went back again making signs of grief .
42023049	And all his friends and the women who came with him from Galilee , were waiting at a distance , watching these things .
42023050	Now there was a man named Joseph , a man of authority and a good and upright man
42023051	( He had not given his approval to their decision or their acts ) , of Arimathaea , a town of the Jews , who was waiting for the kingdom of God :
42023052	This man went to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus .
42023053	And he took it down , and folding it in a linen cloth , he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body ; and no one had ever been put in it .
42023054	Now it was the day of making ready and the Sabbath was coming on .
42023055	And the women who had come with him from Galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest ;
42023056	And they went back and got ready spices and perfumes ; and on the Sabbath they took their rest , in agreement with the law .
42024001	But on the first day of the week , at dawn , they came to the place where his body had been put , taking the spices which they had got ready .
42024002	And they saw that the stone had been rolled away .
42024003	And they went in , but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there .
42024004	And while they were in doubt about it , they saw two men in shining clothing by them :
42024005	And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear , these said to them , Why are you looking for the living among the dead ?
42024006	He is not here , he has come back to life : have in mind what he said to you when he was still in Galilee , saying ,
42024007	The Son of man will be given up into the hands of evil-doers , and be put to death on the cross , and on the third day he will come back to life .
42024008	And his words came back into their minds ,
42024009	And they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others .
42024010	Now they were Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary , the mother of James : and the other women with them said these things to the Apostles .
42024011	But these words seemed foolish to them , and they had no belief in them .
42024012	But Peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put , and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths , and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place .
42024013	And then , two of them , on that very day , were going to a little town named Emmaus , which was about seven miles from Jerusalem .
42024014	And they were talking together about all those things which had taken place .
42024015	And while they were talking and questioning together , Jesus himself came near and went with them .
42024016	But their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him .
42024017	And he said to them , What are you talking about together while you go ?
42024018	Then stopping , and looking sadly at him , one of them , named Cleopas , said to him , Are you the only man living in Jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time ?
42024019	And he said to them , What things ? And they said , The things to do with Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet , great in his acts and his words , before God and all the people :
42024020	And how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross .
42024021	But we were hoping that he would be the Saviour of Israel . In addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place ;
42024022	And certain women among us gave us cause for wonder , for they went early to the place where his body had been put ,
42024023	And it was not there ; then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living .
42024024	And some of those who were with us went to the place , and saw that it was as the women had said , but him they did not see .
42024025	And he said , O foolish men ! how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said .
42024026	Was it not necessary for the Christ to go through these things , and to come into his glory ?
42024027	And he made clear to them all the things in the Writings , from Moses and from all the prophets , which had to do with himself .
42024028	And they came near the town to which they were going , and he seemed as if he was going on ;
42024029	But they kept him back , saying , Do not go , for evening is near , the day is almost gone . And he went in with them .
42024030	And when he was seated with them at table , he took the bread , and said words of blessing and , making division of it , he gave it to them .
42024031	And then their eyes were open , and they had knowledge of him , but he went from their view .
42024032	And they said to one another , Were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way , making clear to us the holy Writings ?
42024033	And that very hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem , where the eleven and the others had come together .
42024034	And they said to them , The Lord has truly come back to life again , and Simon has seen him .
42024035	And they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way , and how , when he gave them bread , they had knowledge of him .
42024036	And while they were saying these things , he himself was among them , and said to them , Peace be with you !
42024037	But they were full of fear , being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit .
42024038	And he said to them , Why are you troubled , and why are your hearts full of doubt ?
42024039	See ; my hands and my feet : it is I myself ; put your hands on me and make certain ; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have .
42024040	And when he had said this , he let them see his hands and his feet .
42024041	And because , for joy and wonder , they were still in doubt , he said to them , Have you any food here ?
42024042	And they gave him a bit of cooked fish .
42024043	And before their eyes he took a meal .
42024044	And he said to them , These are the words which I said to you when I was still with you , how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms about me , to be put into effect .
42024045	Then he made the holy Writings clear to their minds .
42024046	And he said to them , So it is in the Writings that the Christ would undergo death , and come back to life again on the third day ;
42024047	And that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to Jerusalem first and to all nations in his name .
42024048	You are witnesses of these things .
42024049	And now I will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you , but do not go from the town , till the power from heaven comes to you .
42024050	And he took them out till they were near Bethany , and lifting up his hands , he gave them a blessing .
42024051	And while he was doing so , he went from them and was taken up into heaven .
42024052	And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy .
42024053	And they were in the Temple at all times , giving praise to God .
43001001	From the first he was the Word , and the Word was in relation with God and was God .
43001002	This Word was from the first in relation with God .
43001003	All things came into existence through him , and without him nothing was .
43001004	What came into existence in him was life , and the life was the light of men .
43001005	And the light goes on shining in the dark ; it is not overcome by the dark .
43001006	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
43001007	He came for witness , to give witness about the light , so that all men might have faith through him .
43001008	He himself was not the light : he was sent to give witness about the light .
43001009	The true light , which gives light to every man , was then coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , the world which came into being through him , but the world had no knowledge of him .
43001011	He came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts .
43001012	To all those who did so take him , however , he gave the right of becoming children of God--that is , to those who had faith in his name :
43001013	Whose birth was from God and not from blood , or from an impulse of the flesh and man's desire .
43001014	And so the Word became flesh and took a place among us for a time ; and we saw his glory--such glory as is given to an only son by his father--saw it to be true and full of grace .
43001015	John gave witness about him , crying , This is he of whom I said , He who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me .
43001016	From his full measure we have all been given grace on grace .
43001017	For the law was given through Moses ; grace and the true way of life are ours through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No man has seen God at any time ; the only Son , who is on the breast of the Father , he has made clear what God is .
43001019	And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him with the question , Who are you ?
43001020	He said quite openly and straightforwardly , I am not the Christ .
43001021	And they said to him , What then ? Are you Elijah ? And he said , I am not . Are you the prophet ? And his answer was , I am not .
43001022	So they said to him , Who are you then ? We have to give some answer to those who sent us . What have you to say about yourself ?
43001023	He said , I am the voice of one crying in the waste land , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said Isaiah the prophet .
43001024	Those who had been sent came from the Pharisees .
43001025	And they put this question to him , saying , Why then are you giving baptism if you are not the Christ , or Elijah , or the prophet ?
43001026	John's answer was : I give baptism with water ; but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge ;
43001027	It is he who is coming after me ; I am not good enough to undo his shoes .
43001028	These things took place at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan , where John was giving baptism .
43001029	The day after , John sees Jesus coming to him and says , See , here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is he of whom I said , One is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me .
43001031	I myself had no knowledge of him , but I came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by Israel .
43001032	And John gave this witness , saying , I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him .
43001033	I had no knowledge who he was , but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me , The one on whom you see the Spirit coming down and resting , it is he who gives baptism with the Holy Spirit .
43001034	This I saw myself and my witness is that he is the Son of God .
43001035	The day after , John was there again with two of his disciples ;
43001036	And looking at Jesus while he was walking he said , See , there is the Lamb of God !
43001037	Hearing what he said , the two disciples went after Jesus .
43001038	And Jesus , turning round , saw them coming after him and said to them , What are you looking for ? They said to him , Rabbi ( which is to say , Master ) , where are you living ? 
43001039	He said to them , Come and see . They went with him then and saw where he was living ; and they were with him all that day : it was then about the tenth hour of the day .
43001040	Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , was one of the two men who , hearing what John said , went after Jesus .
43001041	Early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him , We have made discovery ! It is the Messiah ! ( which is to say , the Christ ) .
43001042	And he took him to Jesus . Looking at him fixedly Jesus said , You are Simon , the son of John ; your name will be Cephas ( which is to say , Peter ) .
43001043	The day after this , Jesus had a desire to go into Galilee . He came across Philip and said to him , Come and be my disciple .
43001044	Now Philip's town was Beth-saida , where Andrew and Peter came from .
43001045	Philip came across Nathanael and said to him , We have made a discovery ! It is he of whom Moses , in the law , and the prophets were writing , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
43001046	Nazareth ! said Nathanael , Is it possible for any good to come out of Nazareth ? Philip said to him , Come and see .
43001047	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him , See , here is a true son of Israel in whom there is nothing false .
43001048	Nathanael said to him , Where did you get knowledge of me ? In answer Jesus said , Before Philip was talking with you , while you were still under the fig-tree , I saw you .
43001049	Nathanael said to him , Rabbi , you are the Son of God , you are King of Israel !
43001050	In answer Jesus said to him , You have faith because I said to you , I saw you under the fig-tree . You will see greater things than these .
43001051	And he said to him , Truly I say to you all , You will see heaven opening and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of man .
43002001	On the third day two people were going to be married at Cana in Galilee . The mother of Jesus was there :
43002002	And Jesus with his disciples came as guests .
43002003	When they had not enough wine , the mother of Jesus said to him , They have no wine .
43002004	Jesus said to her , Woman , this is not your business ; my time is still to come .
43002005	His mother said to the servants , Whatever he says to you , do it .
43002006	Now six pots of stone , every one taking two or three firkins of water , were placed there for the purpose of washing , as is the way of the Jews .
43002007	Jesus said to the servants , Make the pots full of water . And they made them full to the top .
43002008	Then he said to them , Now take some , and give it to the master of the feast . So they took it to him .
43002009	After tasting the water which had now become wine , the master of the feast ( having no idea where it came from , though it was clear to the servants who took the water out ) sent for the newly-married man ,
43002010	And said to him , Every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good ; but you have kept the good wine till now .
43002011	This , the first of his signs , Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and let his glory be seen openly ; and his disciples put their faith in him .
43002012	After this he went down to Capernaum , with his mother , his brothers , and his disciples , and they were there not more than two or three days .
43002013	The time of the Passover of the Jews was near and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves , and he saw the changers of money in their seats :
43002015	And he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the Temple , with the sheep and the oxen , sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables ;
43002016	And to those who were trading in doves he said , Take these things away ; do not make my Father's house a market .
43002017	And it came to the minds of the disciples that the Writings say , I am on fire with passion for your house .
43002018	Then the Jews put this question to him : What sign of authority have you to give us , seeing that you do these things ?
43002019	And Jesus said to them , Send destruction on this Temple and I will put it up again in three days .
43002020	The Jews said , The building of this Temple took forty-six years ; and you will put it up in three days !
43002021	But his words were about that holy building which was his body .
43002022	So when he had come back again from the dead , the memory of these words came back to the disciples , and they had faith in the holy Writings and in the word which Jesus had said .
43002023	Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover , a great number of people came to have faith in his name , after seeing the signs which he did .
43002024	But Jesus did not have faith in them , because he had knowledge of them all .
43002025	He had no need for any witness about man ; for he himself had knowledge of what was in man .
43003001	Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus , who was one of the rulers of the Jews .
43003002	He came to Jesus by night and said to him , Rabbi , we are certain that you have come from God as a teacher , because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if God was not with him .
43003003	Jesus said to him , Truly , I say to you , Without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of God .
43003004	Nicodemus said to him , How is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old ? Is he able to go into his mother's body a second time and come to birth again ?
43003005	Jesus said in answer , Truly , I say to you , If a man's birth is not from water and from the Spirit , it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of God .
43003006	That which has birth from the flesh is flesh , and that which has birth from the Spirit is spirit .
43003007	Do not be surprised that I say to you , It is necessary for you to have a second birth .
43003008	The wind goes where its pleasure takes it , and the sound of it comes to your ears , but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes : so it is with everyone whose birth is from the Spirit .
43003009	And Nicodemus said to him , How is it possible for these things to be ?
43003010	And Jesus , answering , said , Are you the teacher of Israel and have no knowledge of these things ?
43003011	Truly , I say to you , We say that of which we have knowledge ; we give witness of what we have seen ; and you do not take our witness to be true .
43003012	If you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth , how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven ?
43003013	And no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven , the Son of man .
43003014	As the snake was lifted up by Moses in the waste land , even so it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up :
43003015	So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life .
43003016	For God had such love for the world that he gave his only Son , so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life .
43003017	God did not send his Son into the world to be judge of the world ; he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him .
43003018	The man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged ; but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now , because he has no faith in the name of the only Son of God .
43003019	And this is the test by which men are judged : the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light , because their acts are evil .
43003020	The light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen .
43003021	But he whose life is true comes to the light , so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of God .
43003022	After these things Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judaea , and there he was with them for some time , giving baptism .
43003023	Now John was then giving baptism at Aenon near Salim , because there was much water there ; and people came and were given baptism .
43003024	For at this time John had not been put into prison .
43003025	Then a question came up between John's disciples and a Jew about washing .
43003026	And they went to John and said to him , Rabbi , the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan , the man to whom you gave witness , is now giving baptism , and everyone is going to him .
43003027	And this was John's answer : A man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves give witness that I said , I am not the Christ . What I said was , I am sent before the Christ .
43003029	He who has the bride is the husband : but the husband's friend , whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him , is full of joy because of the husband's voice : such is my joy , and it is complete .
43003030	He has to become greater while I become less .
43003031	He who comes from heaven is greater than all others : he who comes from earth is of the earth , and of the earth are his words : he who comes from heaven is over all .
43003032	He gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears ; and no man takes his witness as true .
43003033	He who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that God is true .
43003034	For he whom God has sent says God's words ; and God does not give him the Spirit by measure .
43003035	The Father has love for the Son and has put all things into his hands .
43003036	He who has faith in the Son has eternal life ; but he who has not faith in the Son will not see life ; God's wrath is resting on him .
43004001	Now when it was clear to the Lord that word had come to the ears of the Pharisees that Jesus was making more disciples than John and was giving them baptism
43004002	( Though , in fact , it was his disciples who gave baptism , not Jesus himself ) ,
43004003	He went out of Judaea into Galilee again .
43004004	And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria .
43004005	So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar , near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph :
43004006	Now Jacob's fountain was there . Jesus , being tired after his journey , was resting by the fountain . It was about the sixth hour .
43004007	A woman of Samaria came to get water , and Jesus said to her , Give me some water .
43004008	For his disciples had gone to the town to get food .
43004009	The woman of Samaria said to him , Why do you , a Jew , make a request for water to me , a woman of Samaria ? She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria .
43004010	In answer Jesus said , If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you , Give me water , you would make your prayer to him , and he would give you living water .
43004011	The woman said to him , Sir , you have no vessel and the fountain is deep ; from where will you get the living water ?
43004012	Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself , with his children and his cattle ?
43004013	Jesus said to her , Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again :
43004014	But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again ; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life .
43004015	The woman said to him , Sir , give me this water , so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it .
43004016	Jesus said to her , Go , get your husband and come back here with him .
43004017	In answer , the woman said , I have no husband . Jesus said to her , You have said rightly , I have no husband :
43004018	You have had five husbands , and the man you have now is not your husband : that was truly said .
43004019	The woman said to him , Sir , I see that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our fathers gave worship on this mountain , but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem .
43004021	Jesus said to her , Woman , take my word for this ; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem .
43004022	You give worship , but without knowledge of what you are worshipping : we give worship to what we have knowledge of : for salvation comes from the Jews .
43004023	But the time is coming , and is even now here , when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit , for these are the worshippers desired by the Father .
43004024	God is Spirit : then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit .
43004025	The woman said to him , I am certain that the Messiah , who is named Christ , is coming ; when he comes he will make all things clear to us .
43004026	Jesus said to her , I , who am talking to you , am he .
43004027	At that point the disciples came back , and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman ; but not one of them said to him , What is your purpose ? or , Why are you talking to her ?
43004028	Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town , and said to the people ,
43004029	Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did ! Is it possible that this is the Christ ?
43004030	So they went out of the town and came to him .
43004031	While this was taking place , the disciples were saying to Jesus , Master , take some food .
43004032	But he said to them , I have food of which you have no knowledge .
43004033	So the disciples said one to another , Did anyone give him food ?
43004034	Jesus said , My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete .
43004035	You would say , Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting . Take a look , I say to you , at the fields ; they are even now white for cutting .
43004036	He who does the cutting now has his reward ; he is getting together fruit for eternal life , so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together .
43004037	In this the saying is a true one , One does the planting , and another gets in the grain .
43004038	I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting : other men did that work , and you take the reward .
43004039	Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness : He has been talking to me of everything I ever did .
43004040	So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time , and he was there two days .
43004041	And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said .
43004042	And they said to the woman , Now we have faith , but not because of your story : we ourselves have given ear to his words , and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world .
43004043	And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee .
43004044	For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth .
43004045	So when he came into Galilee , the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast--they themselves having been there at the feast .
43004046	So he came to Cana in Galilee , where he had made the water wine . And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum .
43004047	When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee , he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son , who was near to death , and make him well .
43004048	Then Jesus said to him , You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders .
43004049	The man said , Sir , come down before my boy is dead .
43004050	And Jesus said , Go in peace ; your son is living . The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away .
43004051	And while he was going down , his servants came to him and said , Your boy is living .
43004052	So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better ; and they said to him , The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour .
43004053	It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him , Your son is living . And he had faith in Jesus , he and all his family .
43004054	Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee .
43005001	After these things there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43005002	Now in Jerusalem near the sheep-market there is a public bath which in Hebrew is named Beth-zatha . It has five doorways .
43005003	In these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases : some unable to see , some without the power of walking , some with wasted bodies .
43005005	One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition , and so he said to the man , Is it your desire to get well ?
43005007	The ill man said in answer , Sir , I have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving ; and while I am on the way down some other person gets in before me .
43005008	Jesus said to him , Get up , take your bed and go .
43005009	And the man became well straight away , and took up his bed and went . Now that day was the Sabbath .
43005010	So the Jews said to the man who had been made well , It is the Sabbath ; and it is against the law for you to take up your bed .
43005011	He said to them , But he who made me well , said to me , Take up your bed and go .
43005012	Then they put to him the question : Who is the man who said to you , Take it up and go ?
43005013	Now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was , Jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place .
43005014	After a time Jesus came across him in the Temple and said to him , See , you are well and strong ; do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you .
43005015	The man went away and said to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
43005016	And for this reason the Jews were turned against Jesus , because he was doing these things on the Sabbath .
43005017	But his answer was : My Father is still working even now , and so I am working .
43005018	For this cause the Jews had an even greater desire to put Jesus to death , because not only did he not keep the Sabbath but he said God was his Father , so making himself equal with God .
43005019	So Jesus made answer and said , Truly I say to you , The Son is not able to do anything himself ; he is able to do only what he sees the Father doing ; whatever the Father does the Son does it in the same way .
43005020	For the Father has love for the Son and lets him see everything which he does : and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder .
43005021	In the same way , as the Father gives life to the dead , even so the Son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it .
43005022	The Father is not the judge of men , but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son ;
43005023	So that all men may give honour to the Son even as they give honour to the Father . He who gives no honour to the Son gives no honour to the Father who sent him .
43005024	Truly I say to you , The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me , has eternal life ; he will not be judged , but has come from death into life .
43005025	Truly I say to you , The time is coming , it has even now come , when the voice of the Son of God will come to the ears of the dead , and those hearing it will have life .
43005026	For even as the Father has life in himself , so he has given to the Son to have life in himself .
43005027	And he has given him authority to be judge because he is the Son of man .
43005028	Do not be surprised at this : for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead ,
43005029	And they will come out ; those who have done good , into the new life ; and those who have done evil , to be judged .
43005030	Of myself I am unable to do anything : as the voice comes to me so I give a decision : and my decision is right because I have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself , but only what is pleasing to him who sent me .
43005031	If I gave witness about myself , my witness would not be true .
43005032	There is another who gives witness about me and I am certain that the witness he gives about me is true .
43005033	You sent to John and he gave true witness .
43005034	But I have no need of a man's witness : I only say these things so that you may have salvation .
43005035	He was a burning and shining light , and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light .
43005036	But the witness which I have is greater than that of John : the work which the Father has given me to do , the very work which I am now doing , is a witness that the Father has sent me .
43005037	And the Father himself who sent me has given witness about me . Not one of you has ever given ear to his voice ; his form you have not seen .
43005038	And you have not kept his word in your hearts , because you have not faith in him whom he has sent .
43005039	You make search in the holy Writings , in the belief that through them you get eternal life ; and it is those Writings which give witness about me .
43005040	And still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life .
43005041	I do not take honour from men ;
43005042	But I have knowledge of you that you have no love for God in your hearts .
43005043	I have come in my Father's name , and your hearts are not open to me . If another comes with no other authority but himself , you will give him your approval .
43005044	How is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only God ?
43005045	Put out of your minds the thought that I will say things against you to the Father : the one who says things against you is Moses , on whom you put your hopes .
43005046	If you had belief in Moses you would have belief in me ; for his writings are about me .
43005047	If you have no belief in his writings , how will you have belief in my words ?
43006001	After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee--that is , the sea of Tiberias .
43006002	And a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill .
43006003	Then Jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples .
43006004	Now the Passover , a feast of the Jews , was near .
43006005	Lifting up his eyes , Jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was , and he said to Philip , Where may we get bread for all these people ?
43006006	This he said , testing him : for he had no doubt what he himself would do .
43006007	Philip made answer , Bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little .
43006008	One of his disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , said to Jesus ,
43006009	There is a boy here with five barley cakes and two fishes : but what is that among such a number ?
43006010	Jesus said , Let the people be seated . Now there was much grass in that place . And those seated on the grass were about five thousand .
43006011	Then Jesus took the cakes and having given praise to God , he gave them to the people who were seated , and the fishes in the same way , as much as they had need of .
43006012	And when they had had enough , Jesus said to his disciples , Take up the broken bits which are over , so that nothing may be wasted .
43006013	So they took them up : twelve baskets full of broken bits of the five cakes which were over after the people had had enough .
43006014	And when the people saw the sign which he had done , they said , Truly , this is the prophet who is to come into the world .
43006015	Now when Jesus saw that the people were about to come and take him by force to make him a king , he went away again up the mountain by himself .
43006016	When evening came the disciples went down to the sea ;
43006017	And they took a boat and went across the sea in the direction of Capernaum . By then it was dark and still Jesus had not come to them .
43006018	The sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing .
43006019	After they had gone three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat ; and they had great fear .
43006020	But he said to them , It is I , have no fear .
43006021	Then they readily took him into the boat : and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going .
43006022	The day after , the people who were on the other side of the sea saw that only one small boat had been there , that Jesus had not gone in that boat with the disciples , but that the disciples had gone away by themselves .
43006023	Some other boats , however , came from Tiberias near to the place where they had taken the bread after the Lord had given praise .
43006024	So when the people saw that Jesus was not there , or his disciples , they got into those boats and went over to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
43006025	And when they came across him on the other side of the sea they said , Rabbi , when did you come here ?
43006026	Jesus , answering them , said , Truly I say to you , You come after me , not because you saw signs , but because you were given the bread and had enough .
43006027	Let your work not be for the food which comes to an end , but for the food which goes on for eternal life , which the Son of man will give to you , for on him has God the Father put his mark .
43006028	Then they said to him , How may we do the works of God ?
43006029	Jesus , answering , said to them , This is to do the work of God : to have faith in him whom God has sent .
43006030	So they said , What sign do you give us , so that we may see and have faith in you ? What do you do ?
43006031	Our fathers had the manna in the waste land , as the Writings say , He gave them bread from heaven .
43006032	Jesus then said to them , Truly I say to you , What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven ; it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	The bread of God is the bread which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world .
43006034	Ah , Lord , they said , give us that bread for ever !
43006035	And this was the answer of Jesus : I am the bread of life . He who comes to me will never be in need of food , and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink .
43006036	But it is as I said to you : you have seen me , and still you have no faith .
43006037	Whatever the Father gives to me will come to me ; and I will not send away anyone who comes to me .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven , not to do my pleasure , but the pleasure of him who sent me .
43006039	And this is the pleasure of him who sent me , that I am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me , but I am to give it new life on the last day .
43006040	This , I say , is my Father's pleasure , that everyone who sees the Son and has faith in him may have eternal life : and I will take him up on the last day .
43006041	Now the Jews said bitter things about Jesus because of his words , I am the bread which came down from heaven .
43006042	And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we have seen ? How is it then that he now says , I have come down from heaven ?
43006043	Jesus made answer and said , Do not say things against me , one to another .
43006044	No man is able to come to me if the Father who sent me does not give him the desire to come : and I will take him up from the dead on the last day .
43006045	The writings of the prophets say , And they will all have teaching from God . Everyone whose ears have been open to the teaching of the Father comes to me .
43006046	Not that anyone has ever seen the Father ; only he who is from God , he has seen the Father .
43006047	Truly I say to you , He who has faith in me has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your fathers took the manna in the waste land--and they are dead .
43006050	The bread which comes from heaven is such bread that a man may take it for food and never see death .
43006051	I am the living bread which has come from heaven : if any man takes this bread for food he will have life for ever : and more than this , the bread which I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world .
43006052	Then the Jews had an angry discussion among themselves , saying , How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh for food ?
43006053	Then Jesus said to them , Truly I say to you , If you do not take the flesh of the Son of man for food , and if you do not take his blood for drink , you have no life in you .
43006054	He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life : and I will take him up from the dead at the last day .
43006055	My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink .
43006056	He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and I in him .
43006057	As the living Father has sent me , and I have life because of the Father , even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me .
43006058	This is the bread which has come down from heaven . It is not like the food which your fathers had : they took of the manna , and are dead ; but he who takes this bread for food will have life for ever .
43006059	Jesus said these things in the Synagogue while he was teaching at Capernaum .
43006060	Then , hearing this , a number of his disciples said , This is a hard saying ; who is able to take in such teaching ?
43006061	When Jesus became conscious that his disciples were protesting about what he said , he said to them , Does this give you trouble ?
43006062	What then will you say if you see the Son of man going up to where he was before ?
43006063	The spirit is the life giver ; the flesh is of no value : the words which I have said to you are spirit and they are life .
43006064	But still some of you have no faith . For it was clear to Jesus from the first who they were who had no faith , and who it was who would be false to him .
43006065	And he said , This is why I said to you , No man is able to come to me if he is not given the power to do so by the Father .
43006066	Because of what he said , a number of the disciples went back and would no longer go with him .
43006067	So Jesus said to the twelve , Have you a desire to go away ?
43006068	Then Simon Peter gave this answer : Lord , to whom are we to go ? you have the words of eternal life ;
43006069	And we have faith and are certain that you are the Holy One of God .
43006070	Then Jesus said , Did I not make a selection of you , the twelve , and one of you is a son of the Evil One ?
43006071	He was talking of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . It was he who was to be false to Jesus--one of the twelve .
43007001	After this , Jesus went from place to place in Galilee . He did not go about in Judaea , because the Jews were looking for a chance to put him to death .
43007002	But the feast of the Jews , the feast of tents , was near .
43007003	So his brothers said to him , Go away from here into Judaea so that your disciples may see the works which you do .
43007004	Because no man does things secretly if he has a desire that men may have knowledge of him . If you do these things , let yourself be seen by all men .
43007005	For even his brothers had no belief in him .
43007006	Jesus said to them , My time is still to come , but any time is good for you .
43007007	It is not possible for you to be hated by the world ; but I am hated by it , because I give witness that what it does is evil .
43007008	Go you up to the feast : I am not going up now to the feast because my time has not fully come .
43007009	Having said these things to them , he still kept in Galilee .
43007010	But after his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he went up , not publicly , but in secret .
43007011	At the feast the Jews were looking for him and saying , Where is he ?
43007012	And there was much discussion about him among the mass of the people . Some said , He is a good man ; but others said , No , he is giving people false ideas .
43007013	But no man said anything about him openly for fear of the Jews .
43007014	Now in the middle of the feast Jesus went up to the Temple and was teaching .
43007015	Then the Jews were surprised and said , How has this man got knowledge of books ? He has never been to school .
43007016	Jesus gave them this answer : It is not my teaching , but his who sent me .
43007017	If any man is ready to do God's pleasure he will have knowledge of the teaching and of where it comes from--from God or from myself .
43007018	The man whose words come from himself is looking for glory for himself , but he who is looking for the glory of him who sent him--that man is true and there is no evil in him .
43007019	Did not Moses give you the law ? Even so , not one of you keeps the law . Why have you a desire to put me to death ?
43007020	The people said in answer , You have an evil spirit : who has any desire to put you to death ?
43007021	This was the answer of Jesus : I have done one work and you are all surprised at it .
43007022	Moses gave you circumcision--not that it comes from Moses , but from the fathers--and even on the Sabbath you give a child circumcision .
43007023	If a child is given circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken , why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Let not your decisions be based on what you see , but on righteousness .
43007025	Then some of the people of Jerusalem said , Is not this the man whose death is desired ?
43007026	And here he is talking openly and they say nothing to him ! Is it possible that the rulers have knowledge that this is truly the Christ ?
43007027	However , it is clear to us where this man comes from : but when the Christ comes no one will have knowledge where he comes from .
43007028	Then , when he was teaching in the Temple , Jesus said with a loud voice , You have knowledge of me and you have knowledge of where I come from ; and I have not come of myself ; but there is One who has sent me ; he is true , but you have no knowledge of him .
43007029	I have knowledge of him because I came from him and he sent me .
43007030	Then they had a desire to take him : but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come .
43007031	And numbers of the people had belief in him , and they said , When the Christ comes will he do more signs than this man has done ?
43007032	This discussion of the people came to the ears of the Pharisees ; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent servants to take him .
43007033	Then Jesus said , I will be with you a little longer and then I go to him who sent me .
43007034	You will be looking for me , and you will not see me : and where I am you may not come .
43007035	So the Jews said among themselves , To what place is he going where we will not see him ? will he go to the Jews living among the Greeks and become the teacher of the Greeks ?
43007036	What is this saying of his , You will be looking for me and will not see me , and where I am you may not come ?
43007037	On the last day , the great day of the feast , Jesus got up and said in a loud voice , If any man is in need of drink let him come to me and I will give it to him .
43007038	He who has faith in me , out of his body , as the Writings have said , will come rivers of living water .
43007039	This he said of the Spirit which would be given to those who had faith in him : the Spirit had not been given then , because the glory of Jesus was still to come .
43007040	When these words came to their ears , some of the people said , This is certainly the prophet .
43007041	Others said , This is the Christ . But others said , Not so ; will the Christ come from Galilee ?
43007042	Do not the Writings say that the Christ comes of the seed of David and from Beth-lehem , the little town where David was ?
43007043	So there was a division among the people because of him .
43007044	And some of them had a desire to take him ; but no man put hands on him .
43007045	Then the servants went back to the chief priests and Pharisees , who said to them , Why have you not got him with you ?
43007046	The servants made answer , No man ever said things like this man .
43007047	Then the Pharisees said to them , Have you , like the others , been given false ideas ?
43007048	Have any of the rulers belief in him , or any one of the Pharisees ?
43007049	But these people who have no knowledge of the law are cursed .
43007050	Nicodemus--he who had come to Jesus before , being himself one of them--said to them ,
43007051	Is a man judged by our law before it has given him a hearing and has knowledge of what he has done ?
43007052	This was their answer : And do you come from Galilee ? Make search and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee .
43007053	[ And every man went to his house ;
43008001	But Jesus went to the Mountain of Olives .
43008002	And early in the morning he came again into the Temple and all the people came to him and he was seated teaching them .
43008003	Now the scribes and Pharisees came , with a woman who had been taken in the act of sinning against the married relation ;
43008004	And putting her forward , they said to him , Master , this woman has been taken in the very act of sinning against the married relation .
43008005	Now in the law Moses gave directions that such women were to be stoned ; what do you say about it ?
43008006	They said this , testing him , so that they might have something against him . But Jesus , with his head bent down , made letters on the floor with his finger .
43008007	But when they went on with their questions , he got up and said to them , Let him among you who is without sin be the first to send a stone at her .
43008008	And again , with bent head , he made letters on the floor .
43008009	And when his words came to their ears , they went out one by one , starting with the oldest even to the last , because they were conscious of what was in their hearts : and Jesus was there by himself with the woman before him .
43008010	Then Jesus got up , and seeing nobody but the woman , he said to her , Where are the men who said things against you ? did no one give a decision against you ?
43008011	And she said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said , And I do not give a decision against you : go , and never do wrong again . ]
43008012	Then again Jesus said to them , I am the light of the world ; he who comes with me will not be walking in the dark but will have the light of life .
43008013	So the Pharisees said to him , The witness you give is about yourself : your witness is not true .
43008014	Jesus said in answer , Even if I give witness about myself , my witness is true , because I have knowledge of where I came from and where I am going ; but you have no knowledge of where I come from or of where I am going .
43008015	You are judging from what you see ; I am judging no man .
43008016	Even if I am judging , my decision is right , because I am not by myself--with me is the Father who sent me .
43008017	Even in your law it is said that the witness of two men is true .
43008018	I give witness about myself and the Father who sent me gives witness about me .
43008019	Then they said to him , Where is your Father ? Jesus said in answer , You have no knowledge of me or of my Father : if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my Father .
43008020	Jesus said these words in the place where the offerings were stored , while he was teaching in the Temple : but no man took him because his time was still to come .
43008021	Then he said to them again , I am going away and you will be looking for me , but death will overtake you in your sins . It is not possible for you to come where I am going .
43008022	So the Jews said , Will he take his life ? Is that why he says , Where I go it is not possible for you to come ?
43008023	And he said to them , You are of the earth ; I am from heaven : you are of this world ; I am not of this world .
43008024	For this reason I said to you that death will overtake you in your sins : for if you have not faith that I am he , death will come to you while you are in your sins .
43008025	Then they said to him , Who are you ? Jesus said , What I said to you from the first .
43008026	I have much to say about you and against you : but he who sent me is true and what he has said to me I say to the world .
43008027	They did not see that his words were about the Father .
43008028	So Jesus said , When the Son of man has been lifted up by you , then it will be clear to you who I am , and that I do nothing of myself , but say as the Father gave me teaching .
43008029	He who sent me is with me ; he has not gone from me , because at all times I do the things which are pleasing to him .
43008030	When he said this a number came to have faith in him .
43008031	Then Jesus said to the Jews who had faith in him , If you keep my word , then you are truly my disciples ;
43008032	And you will have knowledge of what is true , and that will make you free .
43008033	They said to him in answer , We are Abraham's seed and have never been any man's servant : why do you say , You will become free ?
43008034	And this was the answer Jesus gave them : Truly I say to you , Everyone who does evil is the servant of sin .
43008035	Now the servant does not go on living in the house for ever , but the son does .
43008036	If then the son makes you free , you will be truly free .
43008037	I am conscious that you are Abraham's seed ; but you have a desire to put me to death because my word has no place in you .
43008038	I say the things which I have seen in my Father's house : and you do the things which come to you from your father's house .
43008039	In answer they said to him , Our father is Abraham . Jesus said to them , If you were Abraham's children you would do what Abraham did .
43008040	But now you have a desire to put me to death , a man who has said to you what is true , as I had it from God : Abraham did not do that .
43008041	You are doing the works of your father . They said to him , We are true sons of Abraham ; we have one Father , who is God .
43008042	Jesus said to them , If God was your Father you would have love for me , because it was from God I came and am here . I did not come of myself , but he sent me .
43008043	Why are my words not clear to you ? It is because your ears are shut to my teaching .
43008044	You are the children of your father the Evil One and it is your pleasure to do his desires . From the first he was a taker of life ; and he did not go in the true way because there is no true thing in him . When he says what is false , it is natural to him , for he is false and the father of what is false .
43008045	But because I say what is true , you have no belief in me .
43008046	Which of you is able truly to say that I am a sinner ? If I say what is true , why have you no belief in me ?
43008047	He who is a child of God gives ear to the words of God : your ears are not open to them because you are not from God .
43008048	The Jews said to him in answer , Are we not right in saying that you are of Samaria and have an evil spirit ?
43008049	And this was the answer of Jesus : I have not an evil spirit ; but I give honour to my Father and you do not give honour to me .
43008050	I , however , am not in search of glory for myself : there is One who is searching for it and he is judge .
43008051	Truly I say to you , If a man keeps my word he will never see death .
43008052	The Jews said to him , Now we are certain that you have an evil spirit . Abraham is dead , and the prophets are dead ; and you say , If a man keeps my word he will never see death .
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham , who is dead ? and the prophets are dead : who do you say that you are ?
43008054	Jesus said in answer , If I take glory for myself , my glory is nothing : it is my Father who gives me glory , of whom you say that he is your God .
43008055	You have no knowledge of him , but I have knowledge of him ; and if I said I have no knowledge of him I would be talking falsely like you : but I have full knowledge of him , and I keep his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham was full of joy at the hope of seeing my day : he saw it and was glad .
43008057	Then the Jews said to him , You are not fifty years old ; have you seen Abraham ?
43008058	Jesus said to them , Truly I say to you , Before Abraham came into being , I am .
43008059	So they took up stones to send at him : but Jesus got secretly out of their way and went out of the Temple .
43009001	And when he went on his way , he saw a man blind from birth .
43009002	And his disciples put a question to him , saying , Master , was it because of this man's sin , or the sin of his father and mother , that he has been blind from birth ?
43009003	Jesus said in answer , It was not because of his sin , or because of his father's or mother's ; it was so that the works of God might be seen openly in him .
43009004	While it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me : the night comes when no work may be done .
43009005	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
43009006	Having said these words , he put earth , mixed with water from his mouth , on the man's eyes ,
43009007	And said to him , Go and make yourself clean in the bath of Siloam ( the sense of the name is , Sent ) . So he went away and , after washing , came back able to see .
43009008	Then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street , with his hand out for money , said , Is not this the man who got money from people ?
43009009	Some said , It is he : others said , No , but he is like him . He said , I am he .
43009010	So they said to him , How then were your eyes made open ?
43009011	His answer was : The man who is named Jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes , and said to me , Go and make yourself clean in Siloam : so I went away and , after washing , am now able to see .
43009012	And they said to him , Where is he ? His answer was : I have no knowledge .
43009013	They took him before the Pharisees--this man who had been blind .
43009014	Now the day on which the earth was mixed by Jesus and the man's eyes were made open was the Sabbath .
43009015	So the Pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open . And he said to them , He put earth on my eyes , and I had a wash and am able to see .
43009016	Then some of the Pharisees said , That man has not come from God , for he does not keep the Sabbath . Others said , How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs ? So there was a division among them .
43009017	Again they said to the blind man , What have you to say about him for opening your eyes ? And he said , He is a prophet .
43009018	Now the Jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see , till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open ,
43009019	And put the question to them , saying , Is this your son , of whom you say that he was blind at birth ? how is it then that he is now able to see ?
43009020	In answer his father and mother said , We are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth :
43009021	But how it is he is now able to see , or who made his eyes open , we are not able to say : put the question to him ; he is old enough to give an answer for himself .
43009022	They said this because of their fear of the Jews : for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue .
43009023	That was the reason why they said , He is old enough ; put the question to him .
43009024	So they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him , Give glory to God : it is clear to us that this man is a sinner .
43009025	He said in answer , I have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not , but one thing I am certain about ; I was blind , and now I see .
43009026	Then they said to him , What did he do to you ? how did he give you the use of your eyes ?
43009027	His answer was : I have said it before , but your ears were shut : why would you have me say it again ? is it your desire to become his disciples ?
43009028	And they were angry with him and said , You are his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses .
43009029	We are certain that God gave his word to Moses : but as for this man , we have no knowledge where he comes from .
43009030	The man said in answer , Why , here is a strange thing ! You have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes .
43009031	We have knowledge that God does not give ear to sinners , but if any man is a worshipper of God and does his pleasure , to him God's ears are open .
43009032	In all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open .
43009033	If this man did not come from God he would be unable to do anything .
43009034	Their answer was : You came to birth through sin ; do you make yourself our teacher ? And they put him out of the Synagogue .
43009035	It came to the ears of Jesus that they had put him out , and meeting him he said , Have you faith in the Son of man ?
43009036	He said in answer , And who is he , Lord ? Say , so that I may have faith in him .
43009037	Jesus said to him , You have seen him ; it is he who is talking to you .
43009038	And he said , Lord , I have faith . And he gave him worship .
43009039	And Jesus said , I came into this world to be a judge , so that those who do not see may see , and those who see may become blind .
43009040	These words came to the ears of the Pharisees who were with him and they said to him , Are we , then , blind ?
43009041	Jesus said to them , If you were blind you would have no sin : but now that you say , We see ; your sin is there still .
43010001	Truly I say to you , He who does not go through the door into the place where the sheep are kept , but gets in by some other way , is a thief and an outlaw .
43010002	He who goes in by the door is the keeper of the sheep .
43010003	The porter lets him in ; and the sheep give ear to his voice ; he says over the names of the sheep , and takes them out .
43010004	When he has got them all out , he goes before them , and the sheep go after him , for they have knowledge of his voice .
43010005	They will not go after another who is not their keeper , but will go from him in flight , because his voice is strange to them .
43010006	In this Jesus was teaching them in the form of a story : but what he said was not clear to them .
43010007	So Jesus said again , Truly I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
43010008	All who came before me are thieves and outlaws : but the sheep did not give ear to them .
43010009	I am the door : if any man goes in through me he will have salvation , and will go in and go out , and will get food .
43010010	The thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death : he comes for their destruction : I have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure .
43010011	I am the good keeper of sheep : the good keeper gives his life for the sheep .
43010012	He who is a servant , and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep , sees the wolf coming and goes in flight , away from the sheep ; and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions :
43010013	Because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep .
43010014	I am the good keeper ; I have knowledge of my sheep , and they have knowledge of me ,
43010015	Even as the Father has knowledge of me and I of the Father ; and I am giving my life for the sheep .
43010016	And I have other sheep which are not of this field : I will be their guide in the same way , and they will give ear to my voice , so there will be one flock and one keeper .
43010017	For this reason am I loved by the Father , because I give up my life so that I may take it again .
43010018	No one takes it away from me ; I give it up of myself . I have power to give it up , and I have power to take it again . These orders I have from my Father .
43010019	There was a division again among the Jews because of these words .
43010020	And a number of them said , He has an evil spirit and is out of his mind ; why do you give ear to him ?
43010021	Others said , These are not the words of one who has an evil spirit . Is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see ?
43010022	Then came the feast of the opening of the Temple in Jerusalem : it was winter ;
43010023	And Jesus was walking in the Temple , in Solomon's covered way .
43010024	Then the Jews came round him , saying , how long are you going to keep us in doubt ? If you are the Christ , say so clearly .
43010025	Jesus said in answer , I have said it and you have no belief : the works which I do in my Father's name , these give witness about me .
43010026	But you have no belief because you are not of my sheep .
43010027	My sheep give ear to my voice , and I have knowledge of them , and they come after me :
43010028	And I give them eternal life ; they will never come to destruction , and no one will ever take them out of my hand .
43010029	That which my Father has given to me has more value than all ; and no one is able to take anything out of the Father's hand .
43010030	I and my Father are one .
43010031	Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him .
43010032	Jesus said to them in answer , I have let you see a number of good works from the Father ; for which of those works are you stoning me ?
43010033	This was their answer : We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words ; because being a man you make yourself God .
43010034	In answer , Jesus said , Is there not a saying in your law , I said , You are gods ?
43010035	If he said they were gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Writings may not be broken ) ,
43010036	Do you say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world , Your words are evil ; because I said , I am God's Son ?
43010037	If I am not doing the works of my Father , do not have belief in me ;
43010038	But if I am doing them , then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me ; so that you may see clearly and be certain that the Father is in me and I am in the Father .
43010039	Then again they made an attempt to take him ; but he got away from them .
43010040	And he went again to the other side of the Jordan , to the place where John first gave baptism ; and he was there for a time .
43010041	And a great number of people came to him , saying , John did no sign : but everything John said of this man was true .
43010042	And a number came to have faith in him there .
43011001	Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill ; he was of Bethany , the town of Mary and her sister Martha .
43011002	( The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill , was the Mary who put perfumed oil on the Lord and made his feet dry with her hair . )
43011003	So the sisters sent to him , saying , Lord , your dear friend is ill .
43011004	When this came to his ears , Jesus said , The end of this disease is not death , but the glory of God , so that the Son of God may have glory because of it .
43011005	Now Jesus had love in his heart for Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	So when the news came to him that Lazarus was ill , he did not go from the place where he was for two days .
43011007	Then after that time he said to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again .
43011008	The disciples said to him , Master , the Jews were attempting only the other day to have you stoned , and are you going back there again ?
43011009	Then Jesus said in answer , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? A man may go about in the day without falling , because he sees the light of this world .
43011010	But if a man goes about in the night , he may have a fall because the light is not in him .
43011011	These things said he : and after that he said to them , Lazarus our friend is at rest ; but I go so that I may make him come out of his sleep .
43011012	Then his disciples said to him , Lord , if he is resting he will get well .
43011013	Jesus , however , was talking of his death : but they had the idea that he was talking about taking rest in sleep .
43011014	Then Jesus said to them clearly , Lazarus is dead .
43011015	And because of you I am glad I was not there , so that you may have faith ; but let us go to him .
43011016	Then Thomas , who was named Didymus , said to the other disciples , Let us go so that we may be with him in death .
43011017	Now when Jesus came , he made the discovery that Lazarus had been put into the earth four days before .
43011018	Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem , about two miles away ;
43011019	And a number of Jews had come to Martha and Mary to give them comfort about their brother .
43011020	When Martha had the news that Jesus was on the way , she went out to him , but Mary did not go from the house .
43011021	Then Martha said to Jesus , Lord , if you had been here my brother would not be dead .
43011022	But I am certain that , even now , whatever request you make to God , God will give it to you .
43011023	Jesus said to her , Your brother will come to life again .
43011024	Martha said to him , I am certain that he will come to life again when all come back from the dead at the last day .
43011025	Jesus said to her , I am myself that day and that life ; he who has faith in me will have life even if he is dead ;
43011026	And no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death . Is this your faith ?
43011027	She said to him , Yes , Lord : my faith is that you are the Christ , the Son of God , who was to come into the world .
43011028	And having said this , she went away and said secretly to her sister Mary , The Master is here and has sent for you .
43011029	And Mary , hearing this , got up quickly and went to him .
43011030	Now Jesus had not at this time come into the town , but was still in the place where Martha had seen him .
43011031	Then the Jews who were with her in the house , comforting her , when they saw Mary get up quickly and go out , went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there .
43011032	When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him , she went down at his feet , saying , Lord , if you had been here my brother would not be dead .
43011033	And when Jesus saw her weeping , and saw the Jews weeping who came with her , his spirit was moved and he was troubled ,
43011034	And said , Where have you put him ? They said , Come and see , Lord .
43011035	And Jesus himself was weeping .
43011036	So the Jews said , See how dear he was to him !
43011037	But some of them said , This man , who made open the eyes of the blind man , was he not able to keep his friend from death ?
43011038	So Jesus , deeply troubled in heart , came to the place of the dead . It was a hole in the rock , and a stone was over the opening .
43011039	Jesus said , Take away the stone . Martha , the sister of him who was dead , said , Lord , by this time the body will be smelling , for he has been dead four days .
43011040	Jesus said to her , Did I not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of God ?
43011041	So they took away the stone . And Jesus , looking up to heaven , said , Father , I give praise to you for hearing me .
43011042	I was certain that your ears are at all times open to me , but I said it because of these who are here , so that they may see that you sent me .
43011043	Then he said in a loud voice , Lazarus , come out !
43011044	And he who was dead came out , with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet , and a cloth about his face . Jesus said to them , Make him free and let him go .
43011045	Then a number of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did had belief in him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees with the news of what Jesus had done .
43011047	Then the high priests and the Pharisees had a meeting and said , What are we doing ? This man is doing a number of signs .
43011048	If we let him go on in this way , everybody will have belief in him and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation .
43011049	But one of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , said to them , You have no knowledge of anything ;
43011050	You do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people , so that all the nation may not come to destruction .
43011051	He did not say this of himself , but being the high priest that year he said , as a prophet , that Jesus would be put to death for the nation ;
43011052	And not for that nation only , but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of God all over the world .
43011053	And from that day they took thought together how to put him to death .
43011054	So Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews , but went from there into the country near to the waste land , to a town named Ephraim , where he was for some time with the disciples .
43011055	Now the Passover of the Jews was near , and numbers of people went up from the country to Jerusalem to make themselves clean before the Passover .
43011056	They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another while they were in the Temple , What is your opinion ? Will he not come to the feast ?
43011057	Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was , he was to give them word , so that they might take him .
43012001	Then , six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was , whom Jesus had made to come back from the dead .
43012002	So they made him a meal there , and he was waited on by Martha , and Lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table .
43012003	Then Mary , taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value , put it on the feet of Jesus and made them dry with her hair : and the house became full of the smell of the perfume .
43012004	But one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot ( who was to give him up ) , said ,
43012005	Why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence , and the money given to the poor ?
43012006	( He said this , not because he had any love for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and , having the money-bag , took for himself what was put into it . )
43012007	Then Jesus said , Let her be . Let her keep what she has for the day of my death .
43012008	The poor you have ever with you , but me you have not for ever .
43012009	Then a great number of the Jews had news that he was there : and they came , not only because of Jesus , but so that they might see Lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life .
43012010	Now there was talk among the chief priests of putting Lazarus to death ;
43012011	For because of him a great number of the Jews went away and had belief in Jesus .
43012012	The day after , a great number of people who were there for the feast , when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
43012013	Took branches of palm-trees and went out to him , crying , A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord , the King of Israel !
43012014	And Jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it ; as the Writings say ,
43012015	Have no fear , daughter of Zion : see your King is coming , seated on a young ass .
43012016	( These things were not clear to his disciples at first : but when Jesus had been lifted up into his glory , then it came to their minds that these things in the Writings were about him and that they had been done to him . )
43012017	Now the people who were with him when his voice came to Lazarus in the place of the dead , and gave him life again , had been talking about it .
43012018	And that was the reason the people went out to him , because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign .
43012019	Then the Pharisees said one to another , You see , you are unable to do anything : the world has gone after him .
43012020	Now there were some Greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast :
43012021	They came to Philip , who was of Beth-saida in Galilee , and made a request , saying , Sir , we have a desire to see Jesus .
43012022	Philip went and gave word of it to Andrew ; and Andrew went with Philip to Jesus .
43012023	And Jesus said to them in answer , The hour of the glory of the Son of man has come .
43012024	Truly I say to you , If a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end , it is still a seed and no more ; but through its death it gives much fruit .
43012025	He who is in love with life will have it taken from him ; and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever .
43012026	If any man is my servant , let him come after me ; and where I am , there will my servant be . If any man becomes my servant , my Father will give him honour .
43012027	Now is my soul troubled ; and what am I to say ? Father , keep me from this hour . No : for this purpose have I come to this hour .
43012028	Father , give glory to your name . Then there came a voice out of heaven , saying , I have given it glory , and I will give it glory again .
43012029	Hearing the sound , a number of people who were there said that it was thunder : others said , An angel was talking to him .
43012030	Jesus said in answer , This voice came not for me but for you .
43012031	Now is this world to be judged : now will the ruler of this world be sent out .
43012032	And I , if I am lifted up from the earth , will make all men come to me .
43012033	( This he said , pointing to the sort of death he would have . )
43012034	Then the people in answer said to him , The law says that the Christ will have life without end : how say you then that it is necessary for the Son of man to be lifted up ? Who is this Son of man ?
43012035	Jesus said to them , For a little time longer the light will be among you ; while you have the light go on walking in it , so that the dark may not overtake you : one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going .
43012036	In so far as you have the light , put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light . With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them .
43012037	But though he had done such a number of signs before them , they still had no belief in him :
43012038	So that the words of the prophet Isaiah might come true , when he said , Lord , who has any belief in our preaching ? and the arm of the Lord , to whom has it been unveiled ?
43012039	For this reason they were unable to have belief , because Isaiah said again ,
43012040	He has made their eyes blind , and their hearts hard ; for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts , and be changed , and I might make them well .
43012041	( Isaiah said these words because he saw his glory . His words were about him . )
43012042	However , a number even of the rulers had belief in him , but because of the Pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the Synagogue :
43012043	For the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of God .
43012044	Then Jesus said with a loud voice , He who has faith in me , has faith not in me , but in him who sent me .
43012045	And he who sees me , sees him who sent me .
43012046	I have come as a light into the world , so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark .
43012047	And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them , I am not his judge : I did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world .
43012048	He who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart , is not without a judge : the word which I have said will be his judge on the last day .
43012049	For I have not said it on my authority , but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it .
43012050	And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life : so that the things which I say , I say them even as the Father says them to me .
43013001	Now before the feast of the Passover , it was clear to Jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the Father . Having once had love for those in the world who were his , his love for them went on to the end .
43013002	So while a meal was going on , the Evil One having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon's son , to be false to him ,
43013003	Jesus , being conscious that the Father had put everything into his hands , and that he came from God and was going to God ,
43013004	Got up from table , put off his robe and took a cloth and put it round him .
43013005	Then he put water into a basin and was washing the feet of the disciples and drying them with the cloth which was round him .
43013006	So he came to Simon Peter . Peter said , Lord , are my feet to be washed by you ?
43013007	And Jesus , answering , said to him , What I do is not clear to you now , but it will be clear to you in time to come .
43013008	Peter said , I will never let my feet be washed by you , never . Jesus said in answer , If I do not make you clean you have no part with me .
43013009	Simon Peter said to him , Lord , not my feet only , but my hands and my head .
43013010	Jesus said to him , He who is bathed has need only to have his feet washed and then he is clean all over : and you , my disciples , are clean , but not all of you .
43013011	( He had knowledge who was false to him ; that is why he said , You are not all clean . )
43013012	Then , after washing their feet and putting on his robe again , he took his seat and said to them , Do you see what I have done to you ?
43013013	You give me the name of Master and Lord : and you are right ; that is what I am .
43013014	If then I , the Lord and the Master , have made your feet clean , it is right for you to make one another's feet clean .
43013015	I have given you an example , so that you may do what I have done to you .
43013016	Truly I say to you , A servant is not greater than his lord ; and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him .
43013017	If these things are clear to you , happy are you if you do them .
43013018	I am not talking of you all : I have knowledge of my true disciples , but things are as they are , so that the Writings may come true , The foot of him who takes bread with me is lifted up against me .
43013019	From this time forward , I give you knowledge of things before they come about , so that when they come about you may have belief that I am he .
43013020	Truly I say to you , He who takes to his heart anyone whom I send , takes me to his heart ; and he who so takes me , takes him who sent me .
43013021	When Jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit , and gave witness , saying , Truly I say to you , that one of you will be false to me .
43013022	Then the eyes of the disciples were turned on one another , in doubt as to whom he had in mind .
43013023	There was at table one of his disciples , the one dear to Jesus , resting his head on Jesus ' breast .
43013024	Making a sign to him , Simon Peter said , Who is it he is talking about ?
43013025	He , then , resting his head on Jesus ' breast , said to him , Lord , who is it ?
43013026	This was the answer Jesus gave : It is the one to whom I will give this bit of bread after I have put it in the vessel . Then he took the bit of bread , put it into the vessel , and gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	And when Judas took the bread Satan went into him . Then Jesus said to him , Do quickly what you have to do .
43013028	Now it was not clear to anyone at table why he said this to him .
43013029	Some were of the opinion that because Judas kept the money-bag Jesus said to him , Get the things we have need of for the feast ; or , that he was to give something to the poor .
43013030	So Judas , having taken the bit of bread , straight away went out : and it was night .
43013031	Then when he had gone out , Jesus said , Now is glory given to the Son of man , and God is given glory in him .
43013032	If God is given glory in him , God will give him glory in himself , and will give him glory even now .
43013033	My dear children , I am only to be with you a little longer . Then you will be looking for me : and as I said to the Jews , so now I say to you , Where I am going you may not come .
43013034	I give you a new law : Have love one for another ; even as I have had love for you , so are you to have love one for another .
43013035	By this it will be clear to all men that you are my disciples , if you have love one for another .
43013036	Simon Peter said to him , Lord , where are you going ? Jesus said in answer , Where I am going you may not come with me now , but you will come later .
43013037	Peter said to him , Why may I not come with you even now ? I will give up my life for you .
43013038	Jesus said in answer , Will you give up your life for me ? Truly I say to you , Before the cry of the cock you will have said three times that you are not my disciple .
43014001	Let not your heart be troubled : have faith in God and have faith in me .
43014002	In my Father's house are rooms enough ; if it was not so , would I have said that I am going to make ready a place for you ?
43014003	And if I go and make ready a place for you , I will come back again and will take you to be with me , so that you may be where I am .
43014004	And you all have knowledge of where I am going , and of the way to it .
43014005	Thomas said , Lord , we have no knowledge of where you are going ; how may we have knowledge of the way ?
43014006	Jesus said to him , I am the true and living way : no one comes to the Father but by me .
43014007	If you had knowledge of me , you would have knowledge of my Father : you have knowledge of him now and have seen him .
43014008	Philip said to him , Lord , let us see the Father , and we have need of nothing more .
43014009	Jesus said to him , Philip , have I been with you all this time , and still you have no knowledge of me ? He who has seen me has seen the Father . Why do you say , Let us see the Father ?
43014010	Have you not faith that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words which I say to you , I say not from myself : but the Father who is in me all the time does his works .
43014011	Have faith that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me : at least , have faith in me because of what I do .
43014012	Truly I say to you , He who puts his faith in me will do the very works which I do , and he will do greater things than these , because I am going to my Father .
43014013	And whatever request you make in my name , that I will do , so that the Father may have glory in the Son .
43014014	If you make any request to me in my name , I will do it .
43014015	If you have love for me , you will keep my laws .
43014016	And I will make prayer to the Father and he will give you another Helper to be with you for ever ,
43014017	Even the Spirit of true knowledge . That Spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him : but you have knowledge of him , because he is ever with you and will be in you .
43014018	I will not let you be without a friend : I am coming to you .
43014019	A little time longer , and the world will see me no more ; but you will see me ; and you will be living because I am living .
43014020	At that time it will be clear to you that I am in my Father , and you are in me , and I in you .
43014021	He who has my laws and keeps them , he it is who has love for me : and he who has love for me will be loved by my Father , and I will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him .
43014022	Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , How is it that you will let yourself be seen clearly by us and not by the world ?
43014023	Jesus said to him in answer , If anyone has love for me , he will keep my words : and he will be dear to my Father ; and we will come to him and make our living-place with him .
43014024	He who has no love for me does not keep my words ; and the word which you are hearing is not my word but the Father's who sent me .
43014025	I have said all this to you while I am still with you .
43014026	But the Helper , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will be your teacher in all things and will put you in mind of everything I have said to you .
43014027	May peace be with you ; my peace I give to you : I give it not as the world gives . Let not your heart be troubled ; let it be without fear .
43014028	Keep in mind how I said to you , I go away and come to you again . If you had love for me you would be glad , because I am going to the Father : for the Father is greater than I .
43014029	And now I have given you word of it before it comes , so that , when it comes , you may have faith .
43014030	After this I will not say much to you , because the ruler of this world comes : and he has no power over me ;
43014031	But he comes so that the world may see that I have love for the Father , and that I am doing as I am ordered by the Father . Get up , and let us go .
43015001	I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener .
43015002	He takes away every branch in me which has no fruit , and every branch which has fruit he makes clean , so that it may have more fruit .
43015003	You are clean , even now , through the teaching which I have given you .
43015004	Be in me at all times as I am in you . As the branch is not able to give fruit of itself , if it is not still on the vine , so you are not able to do so if you are not in me .
43015005	I am the vine , you are the branches : he who is in me at all times as I am in him , gives much fruit , because without me you are able to do nothing .
43015006	If a man does not keep himself in me , he becomes dead and is cut off like a dry branch ; such branches are taken up and put in the fire and burned .
43015007	If you are in me at all times , and my words are in you , then anything for which you make a request will be done for you .
43015008	Here is my Father's glory , in that you give much fruit and so are my true disciples .
43015009	Even as the Father has given me his love , so I have given my love to you : be ever in my love .
43015010	If you keep my laws , you will be ever in my love , even as I have kept my Father's laws , and am ever in his love .
43015011	I have said these things to you so that I may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete .
43015012	This is the law I give you : Have love one for another , even as I have love for you .
43015013	Greater love has no man than this , that a man gives up his life for his friends .
43015014	You are my friends , if you do what I give you orders to do .
43015015	No longer do I give you the name of servants ; because a servant is without knowledge of what his master is doing : I give you the name of friends , because I have given you knowledge of all the things which my Father has said to me .
43015016	You did not take me for yourselves , but I took you for myself ; and I gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever ; so that whatever request you make to the Father in my name he may give it to you .
43015017	So this is my law for you : Have love one for another .
43015018	If you are hated by the world , keep in mind that I was hated by the world before you .
43015019	If you were of the world , you would be loved by the world : but because you are not of the world , but I have taken you out of the world , you are hated by the world .
43015020	Keep in mind the words I said to you , A servant is not greater than his lord . If they were cruel to me , they will be cruel to you ; if they kept my words , they will keep yours .
43015021	They will do all this to you because of my name--because they have no knowledge of him who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin : but now they have no reason to give for their sin .
43015023	He who has hate for me has hate for my Father .
43015024	If I had not done among them the works which no other man ever did , they would have had no sin : but now they have seen , and they have had hate in their hearts for me and my Father .
43015025	This comes about so that the writing in their law may be made true , Their hate for me was without cause .
43015026	When the Helper comes , whom I will send to you from the Father even the Spirit of true knowledge who comes from the Father--he will give witness about me ;
43015027	And you , in addition , will give witness because you have been with me from the first .
43016001	I have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt .
43016002	They will put you out of the Synagogues : yes , the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing God's pleasure .
43016003	They will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the Father or of me .
43016004	I have said these things to you so that when the time comes , what I have said may come to your mind . I did not say them to you at the first , because then I was still with you .
43016005	But now I am going to him who sent me ; and not one of you says to me , Where are you going ?
43016006	But your hearts are full of sorrow because I have said these things .
43016007	But what I am saying is true : my going is for your good : for if I do not go away , the Helper will not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	And he , when he comes , will make the world conscious of sin , and of righteousness , and of being judged :
43016009	Of sin , because they have not faith in me ;
43016010	Of righteousness , because I go to the Father and you will see me no more ;
43016011	Of being judged , because the ruler of this world has been judged .
43016012	I have still much to say to you , but you are not strong enough for it now .
43016013	However , when he , the Spirit of true knowledge , has come , he will be your guide into all true knowledge : for his words will not come from himself , but whatever has come to his hearing , that he will say : and he will make clear to you the things to come .
43016014	He will give me glory , because he will take of what is mine , and make it clear to you .
43016015	Everything which the Father has is mine : that is why I say , He will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you .
43016016	After a little time you will see me no longer ; and then again , after a little time , you will see me .
43016017	So some of the disciples said one to another , What is this he is saying , After a little time , you will see me no longer ; and then again , after a little time , you will see me ? and , I am going to the Father ?
43016018	So they said again and again , What is this he is saying , A little time ? His words are not clear to us .
43016019	Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him , so he said to them , Is this what you are questioning one with another , why I said , After a little time , you will see me no longer ; and then again , after a little time , you will see me ?
43016020	Truly I say to you , You will be weeping and sorrowing , but the world will be glad : you will be sad , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
43016021	When a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow , because her hour is come ; but when she has given birth to the child , the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world .
43016022	So you have sorrow now : but I will see you again , and your hearts will be glad , and no one will take away your joy .
43016023	And on that day you will put no questions to me . Truly I say to you , Whatever request you make to the Father , he will give it to you in my name .
43016024	Up to now you have made no request in my name : do so , and it will be answered , so that your hearts may be full of joy .
43016025	All this I have said to you in veiled language : but the time is coming when I will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the Father clearly .
43016026	In that day you will make requests in my name : and I do not say that I will make prayer to the Father for you ,
43016027	For the Father himself gives his love to you , because you have given your love to me and have had faith that I came from God .
43016028	I came out from the Father and have come into the world : again , I go away from the world and go to the Father .
43016029	His disciples said , Now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language .
43016030	Now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you : through this we have faith that you came from God .
43016031	Jesus made answer , Have you faith now ?
43016032	See , a time is coming , yes , it is now here , when you will go away in all directions , every man to his house , and I will be by myself : but I am not by myself , because the Father is with me .
43016033	I have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace . In the world you have trouble : but take heart ! I have overcome the world .
43017001	Jesus said these things ; then , lifting his eyes to heaven , he said , Father , the time has now come ; give glory to your Son , so that the Son may give glory to you :
43017002	Even as you gave him authority over all flesh , to give eternal life to all those whom you have given to him .
43017003	And this is eternal life : to have knowledge of you , the only true God , and of him whom you have sent , even Jesus Christ .
43017004	I have given you glory on the earth , having done all the work which you gave me to do .
43017005	And now , Father , let me have glory with you , even that glory which I had with you before the world was .
43017006	I have given knowledge of your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world : yours they were , and you gave them to me , and they have kept your words .
43017007	Now it is clear to them that whatever you have given to me comes from you :
43017008	Because I have given them the words which you gave to me ; and they have taken them to heart , and have certain knowledge that I came from you , and they have faith that you sent me .
43017009	My prayer is for them : my prayer is not for the world , but for those whom you have given to me , because they are yours
43017010	( All mine are yours , and yours are mine ) and I have glory in them .
43017011	And now I will be no longer in the world , but they are in the world and I come to you . Holy Father , keep them in your name which you have given to me , so that they may be one even as we are one .
43017012	While I was with them I kept them safe in your name which you have given to me : I took care of them and not one of them has come to destruction , but only the son of destruction , so that the Writings might come true .
43017013	And now I come to you ; and these things I say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in them .
43017014	I have given your word to them ; and they are hated by the world , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
43017015	My prayer is not that you will take them out of the world , but that you will keep them from the Evil One .
43017016	They are not of the world any more than I am of the world .
43017017	Make them holy by the true word : your word is the true word .
43017018	Even as you have sent me into the world , so I have sent them into the world .
43017019	And for them I make myself holy , so that they may be made truly holy .
43017020	My prayer is not for them only , but for all who will have faith in me through their word ;
43017021	May they all be one ! Even as you , Father , are in me and I am in you , so let them be in us , so that all men may come to have faith that you sent me .
43017022	And the glory which you have given to me I have given to them , so that they may be one even as we are one ;
43017023	I in them , and you in me , so that they may be made completely one , and so that it may become clear to all men that you have sent me and that they are loved by you as I am loved by you .
43017024	Father , it is my desire that these whom you have given to me may be by my side where I am , so that they may see my glory which you have given to me , because you had love for me before the world came into being .
43017025	Father of righteousness , I have knowledge of you , though the world has not ; and to these it is clear that you sent me ;
43017026	And I have given to them knowledge of your name , and will give it , so that the love which you have for me may be in them and I in them .
43018001	When Jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream Kedron to a garden , into which he went with his disciples .
43018002	And Judas , who was false to him , had knowledge of the place because Jesus went there frequently with his disciples .
43018003	So Judas , getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and Pharisees , went there with lights and with arms .
43018004	Then Jesus , having knowledge of everything which was coming on him , went forward and said to them , Who are you looking for ?
43018005	Their answer was , Jesus the Nazarene . Jesus said , I am he . And Judas , who was false to him , was there at their side .
43018006	And when he said to them , I am he , they went back , falling to the earth .
43018007	So again he put the question to them , Who are you looking for ? And they said , Jesus the Nazarene .
43018008	Jesus made answer , I have said that I am he ; if you are looking for me , let these men go away .
43018009	( He said this so that his words might come true , I have kept safe all those whom you gave to me . )
43018010	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , took it out and gave the high priest's servant a blow , cutting off his right ear . The servant's name was Malchus .
43018011	Then Jesus said to Peter , Put back your sword : am I not to take the cup which my Father has given to me ?
43018012	Then the band and the chief captain and the police took Jesus and put cords round him .
43018013	They took him first to Annas , because Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year .
43018014	It was Caiaphas who had said to the Jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people .
43018015	And Simon Peter went after Jesus with another disciple . Now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with Jesus into the house of the high priest ;
43018016	But Peter was kept outside at the door . Then this other disciple , who was a friend of the high priest , came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door , and took Peter in .
43018017	Then the girl who was the door-keeper said to Peter , Are you not one of this man's disciples ? In answer he said , I am not .
43018018	Now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold ; they were warming themselves in front of it and Peter was there with them , warming himself .
43018019	Then the high priest put questions to Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
43018020	Jesus made answer , I said things openly to the world at all times ; I have given my teaching in the Synagogues and in the Temple to which all the Jews come ; and I have said nothing secretly .
43018021	Why are you questioning me ? put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them : they have knowledge of what I said .
43018022	When he said this , one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand , saying , Do you give such an answer to the high priest ?
43018023	Jesus said in answer , If I have said anything evil , give witness to the evil : but if I said what is true , why do you give me blows ?
43018024	Then Annas sent him chained to Caiaphas , the high priest .
43018025	But Simon Peter was still there warming himself by the fire . They said to him , Are you not one of his disciples ? He said , No , I am not .
43018026	One of the servants of the high priest , a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by Peter , said , Did I not see you with him in the garden ?
43018027	Then again Peter said , No . And straight away a cock gave its cry .
43018028	So they took Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium . It was early . They themselves did not go into the Praetorium , so that they might not become unclean , but might take the Passover .
43018029	So Pilate came out to them and put the question : What have you to say against this man ?
43018030	They said to him in answer , If the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you .
43018031	Then Pilate said to them , Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law . But the Jews said to him , We have no right to put any man to death .
43018032	( That the word of Jesus might come true , pointing to the sort of death he would have . )
43018033	Then Pilate went back into the Praetorium and sent for Jesus and said to him , Are you the King of the Jews ?
43018034	Jesus made answer , Do you say this of yourself , or did others say it about me ?
43018035	Pilate said , Am I a Jew ? Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands : what have you done ?
43018036	Jesus said in answer , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom was of this world , my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the Jews : but my kingdom is not here .
43018037	Then Pilate said to him , Are you then a king ? Jesus made answer , You say that I am a king . For this purpose was I given birth , and for this purpose I came into the world , that I might give witness to what is true . Every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice .
43018038	Pilate said to him , True ? what is true ? Having said this he went out again to the Jews and said to them , I see no wrong in him .
43018039	But every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the Passover . Is it your desire that I let the King of the Jews go free ?
43018040	Then again they gave a loud cry , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was an outlaw .
43019001	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped with cords .
43019002	And the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head , and they put a purple robe on him .
43019003	And they kept coming and saying , Long life to the King of the Jews ! And they gave him blows with their hands .
43019004	And Pilate went out again and said to them , See , I let him come out to you to make it clear to you that I see no wrong in him .
43019005	Then Jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe . And Pilate said to them , Here is the man !
43019006	So when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry , To the cross ! to the cross ! Pilate said to them , Take him yourselves and put him on the cross : I see no crime in him .
43019007	And the Jews made answer , We have a law , and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God .
43019008	When this saying came to Pilate's ears his fear became greater ;
43019009	And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus , Where do you come from ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
43019010	Then Pilate said to him , You say nothing to me ? is it not clear to you that I have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross ?
43019011	Jesus gave this answer : You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God ; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin .
43019012	Hearing this , Pilate had a desire to let him go free , but the Jews said in a loud voice , If you let this man go , you are not Caesar's friend : everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar .
43019013	So when these words came to Pilate's ear , he took Jesus out , seating himself in the judge's seat in a place named in Hebrew , Gabbatha , or the Stone Floor .
43019014	( It was the day when they made ready for the Passover ; and it was about the sixth hour . ) And he said to the Jews , There is your King !
43019015	Then they gave a loud cry , Away with him ! away with him ! to the cross ! Pilate said to them , Am I to put your King to death on the cross ? The chief priests said in answer , We have no king but Caesar .
43019016	So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross . And they took Jesus away ;
43019017	And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head ( in Hebrew , Golgotha ) :
43019018	Where they put him on the cross with two others , one on this side and one on that , and Jesus in the middle .
43019019	And Pilate put on the cross a statement in writing . The writing was : JESUS THE NAZARENE , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
43019020	The writing was seen by a number of the Jews , for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town ; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek .
43019021	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , Do not put , The King of the Jews , but , He said , I am the King of the Jews .
43019022	But Pilate made answer , What I have put in writing will not be changed .
43019023	And when Jesus was nailed to the cross , the men of the army took his clothing , and made a division of it into four parts , to every man a part , and they took his coat : now the coat was without a join , made out of one bit of cloth .
43019024	So they said among themselves , Let this not be cut up , but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it . ( They did this so that the Writings might come true , which say , They made a distribution of my clothing among them , and my coat they put to the decision of chance . ) This was what the men of the army did .
43019025	Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother , and his mother's sister Mary , the wife of Cleopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him , he said to his mother , Mother , there is your son !
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , There is your mother ! And from that hour the disciple took her to his house .
43019028	After this , being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true , Jesus said , Give me water .
43019029	Now there was a vessel ready , full of bitter wine , and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth .
43019030	So when Jesus had taken the wine he said , All is done . And with his head bent he gave up his spirit .
43019031	Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover , and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath ( because the day of that Sabbath was a great day ) , the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
43019032	So the men of the army came , and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus :
43019033	But when they came to Jesus , they saw that he was dead by this time , and so his legs were not broken ;
43019034	But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear , and straight away there came out blood and water .
43019035	And he who saw it has given witness ( and his witness is true ; he is certain that what he says is true ) so that you may have belief .
43019036	These things came about so that the Writings might be true , No bone of his body will be broken .
43019037	And again another verse says , They will see him who was wounded by their spears .
43019038	After these things , Joseph of Arimathaea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate said he might do so . So he went and took away his body .
43019039	And Nicodemus came ( he who had first come to Jesus by night ) with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed , about a hundred pounds .
43019040	Then they took the body of Jesus , folding linen about it with the spices , as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest .
43019041	Now there was a garden near the cross , and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put .
43019042	So they put Jesus there , because it was the Jews ' day of getting ready for the Passover , and the place was near .
43020001	Now on the first day of the week , very early , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it .
43020002	Then she went running to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple who was loved by Jesus , and said to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him .
43020003	So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead .
43020004	They went running together , and the other disciple got in front of Peter and came first to the hole in the rock ;
43020005	And looking in , he saw the linen bands on the earth ; but he did not go in ,
43020006	Then Simon Peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock ; and he saw the linen bands on the earth ,
43020007	And the cloth , which had been round his head , not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself .
43020008	Then the other disciple who came there first went in ; and he saw and belief came to him .
43020009	For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead .
43020010	So then the disciples went away again to their houses .
43020011	But Mary was still there outside the hole in the rock , weeping ; and while she was weeping and looking into the hole ,
43020012	She saw two angels in white seated where the body of Jesus had been , one at the head and the other at the feet .
43020013	They said to her , Woman , why are you weeping ? She said to them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I have no knowledge where they have put him .
43020014	And then looking round , she saw Jesus there , but had no idea that it was Jesus .
43020015	Jesus said to her , Woman , why are you weeping ? who are you looking for ? She , taking him for the gardener , said to him , Sir , if you have taken him away from here , say where you have put him and I will take him away .
43020016	Jesus said to her , Mary ! Turning , she said to him in Hebrew , Rabboni ! ( which is to say , Master ) .
43020017	Jesus said to her , Do not put your hand on me , for I have not gone up to the Father : but go to my brothers and say to them , I go up to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God .
43020018	Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples , and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her .
43020019	At evening on that day , the first day of the week , when , for fear of the Jews , the doors were shut where the disciples were , Jesus came among them and said to them , May peace be with you !
43020020	And when he had said this , he let them see his hands and his side . Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord .
43020021	And Jesus said to them again , May peace be with you ! As the Father sent me , even so I now send you .
43020022	And when he had said this , breathing on them , he said to them , Let the Holy Spirit come on you :
43020023	Any to whom you give forgiveness , will be made free from their sins ; and any from whom you keep back forgiveness , will still be in their sins .
43020024	Now Thomas , one of the twelve , named Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
43020025	So the other disciples said to him , We have seen the Lord . But he said to them , If I do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails , and if I do not put my hand into his side , I will never have belief .
43020026	And after eight days , his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them . Though the doors were shut , Jesus came , and taking his place in the middle of them , he said , May peace be with you !
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , Put out your finger , and see my hands ; and put your hand here into my side : and be no longer in doubt but have belief .
43020028	And Thomas said in answer , My Lord and my God !
43020029	Jesus said to him , Because you have seen me you have belief : a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me !
43020030	A number of other signs Jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book :
43020031	But these are recorded , so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and so that , having this faith you may have life in his name .
43021001	After these things Jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; and it came about in this way .
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas named Didymus , Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples were all together .
43021003	Simon Peter said to them , I am going fishing . They said to him , And we will come with you . They went out and got into the boat ; but that night they took no fish .
43021004	Now very early in the morning Jesus was there by the edge of the sea ( though the disciples were not conscious that it was Jesus ) .
43021005	So Jesus said to them , Children , have you taken any fish ? They made answer , No .
43021006	And he said to them , Let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some . So they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish .
43021007	So the disciple who was dear to Jesus said to Peter , It is the Lord ! Hearing that it was the Lord , Peter put his coat round him ( because he was not clothed ) and went into the sea .
43021008	And the other disciples came in the little boat ( they were not far from land , only about two hundred cubits off ) pulling the net full of fish .
43021009	When they got to land , they saw a fire of coals there , with fish cooking on it , and bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , Get some of the fish which you have now taken .
43021011	So Peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land , full of great fish , a hundred and fifty-three ; and though there was such a number the net was not broken .
43021012	Jesus said to them , Come and take some food . And all the disciples were in fear of putting the question , Who are you ? being conscious that it was the Lord .
43021013	Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , and the fish in the same way .
43021014	Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead .
43021015	Then when they had taken food , Jesus said to Simon Peter , Simon , son of John , is your love for me greater than the love of these others ? He said to him , Yes , Lord ; you are certain of my love for you . He said to him , Then give my lambs food .
43021016	Again , a second time , he said to him , Simon , son of John , have you any love for me ? Yes , Lord , he said , you are certain of my love for you . Then take care of my sheep , said Jesus .
43021017	He said to him a third time , Simon , son of John , am I dear to you ? Now Peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time , Am I dear to you ? And he said to him , Lord , you have knowledge of all things ; you see that you are dear to me . Jesus said to him , Then give my sheep food .
43021018	Truly I say to you , When you were young , you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go : but when you are old , you will put out your hands and another will make you ready , and you will be taken where you have no desire to go .
43021019	Now this he said , pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory . And after saying this , he said to him , Come after me .
43021020	Then Peter , turning round , saw the disciple who was dear to Jesus coming after them--the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal , and said , Lord , who is it who will be false to you ?
43021021	Seeing him , Peter said to Jesus , What about this man ?
43021022	Jesus said to him , If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back , what is that to you ? come yourself after me .
43021023	So this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death : Jesus , however , did not say that he would not undergo death , but , If it is my desire for him to be here till I come back , what is that to you ?
43021024	This is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing : and we have knowledge that his witness is true .
43021025	And Jesus did such a number of other things that , if every one was recorded , it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be .
44001001	I have given an earlier account , O Theophilus , of all the things which Jesus did , and of his teaching from the first ,
44001002	Till the day when he was taken up to heaven after he had given his orders , through the Holy Spirit , to the Apostles of whom he had made selection :
44001003	And to whom he gave clear and certain signs that he was living , after his death ; for he was seen by them for forty days , and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God :
44001004	And when they were all together , with him , he gave them orders not to go away from Jerusalem , but to keep there , waiting till the word of the Father was put into effect , of which , he said , I have given you knowledge :
44001005	For the baptism of John was with water , but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit , after a little time .
44001006	So , when they were together , they said to him , Lord , will you at this time give back the kingdom to Israel ?
44001007	And he said to them , It is not for you to have knowledge of the time and the order of events which the Father has kept in his control .
44001008	But you will have power , when the Holy Spirit has come on you ; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judaea and Samaria , and to the ends of the earth .
44001009	And when he had said these things , while they were looking , he was taken up , and went from their view into a cloud .
44001010	And while they were looking up to heaven with great attention , two men came to them , in white clothing ,
44001011	And said , O men of Galilee , why are you looking up into heaven ? This Jesus , who was taken from you into heaven , will come again , in the same way as you saw him go into heaven .
44001012	Then they went back to Jerusalem from the mountain named Olivet , which is near Jerusalem , a Sabbath day's journey away .
44001013	And when they came in , they went up into the room where they were living ; Peter and John and James and Andrew , Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew , James , the son of Alphaeus , and Simon the Zealot , and Judas , the son of James .
44001014	And they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer , with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and his brothers .
44001015	And in those days Peter got up among the brothers ( there were about one hundred and twenty of them ) , and said ,
44001016	My brothers , the word of God had to be put into effect , which the Holy Spirit had said before , by the mouth of David , about Judas , who was guide to those who took Jesus ,
44001017	For he was numbered among us , and had his part in our work .
44001018	( Now this man , with the reward of his evil-doing , got for himself a field , and falling head first , came to a sudden and violent end there .
44001019	And this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in Jerusalem , so that the field was named in their language , Akel-dama , or , The field of blood . )
44001020	For in the book of Psalms it says , Let his house be waste , and let no man be living in it : and , Let his position be taken by another .
44001021	For this reason , of the men who have been with us all the time , while the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
44001022	Starting from the baptism of John till he went up from us , one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death .
44001023	And they made selection of two , Joseph , named Barsabbas , whose other name was Justus , and Matthias .
44001024	And they made prayers and said , Lord , having knowledge of the hearts of all men , make clear which of these two has been marked out by you ,
44001025	To take that position as a servant and Apostle , from which Judas by his sin was shut out , so that he might go to his place .
44001026	And they put it to the decision of chance , and the decision was given for Matthias , and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles .
44002001	And when the day of Pentecost was come , they were all together in one place .
44002002	And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind , and all the house where they were was full of it .
44002003	And they saw tongues , like flames of fire , coming to rest on every one of them .
44002004	And they were all full of the Holy Spirit , and were talking in different languages , as the Spirit gave them power .
44002005	Now there were living at Jerusalem , Jews , God-fearing men , from every nation under heaven .
44002006	And when this sound came to their ears , they all came together , and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language .
44002007	And they were full of wonder and said , Are not all these men Galilaeans ?
44002008	And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth ?
44002009	Men of Parthia , Media , and Elam , and those living in Mesopotamia , in Judaea and Cappadocia , in Pontus and Asia ,
44002010	In Phrygia and Pamphylia , in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and those who have come from Rome , Jews by birth and others who have become Jews ,
44002011	Men of Crete and Arabia , to all of us they are talking in our different languages , of the great works of God .
44002012	And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another , What is the reason of this ?
44002013	But others , making sport of them , said , They are full of new wine .
44002014	But Peter , getting up , with the eleven , said in a loud voice , O men of Judaea , and all you who are living in Jerusalem , take note of this and give ear to my words .
44002015	For these men are not overcome with wine , as it seems to you , for it is only the third hour of the day ;
44002016	But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel ;
44002017	And it will come about , in the last days , says God , that I will send out my Spirit on all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets , and your young men will see visions , and your old men will have dreams :
44002018	And on my men-servants and my women-servants I will send my Spirit , and they will be prophets .
44002019	And wonders will be seen in heaven , and signs on the earth , blood and fire and smoke :
44002020	The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood , before that great day of the Lord comes in glory :
44002021	And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation .
44002022	Men of Israel , give ear to these words : Jesus of Nazareth , a man who had the approval of God , as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you , as you yourselves have knowledge ,
44002023	Him , when he was given up , by the decision and knowledge of God , you put to death on the cross , by the hands of evil men :
44002024	But God gave him back to life , having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it .
44002025	For David said of him , I saw the Lord before my face at all times , for he is at my right hand , so that I may not be moved :
44002026	And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy , and my flesh will be resting in hope :
44002027	For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction .
44002028	You have made me see the ways of life ; I will be full of joy when I see your face .
44002029	My brothers , I may say to you openly that David came to his death , and was put in the earth , and his resting-place is with us today .
44002030	But being a prophet , and having in mind the oath which God had given to him , that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king ,
44002031	He , having knowledge of the future , was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead , that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction .
44002032	This Jesus God has given back to life , of which we all are witnesses .
44002033	And so , being lifted up to the right hand of God , and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come , he has sent this thing , which now you see and have knowledge of .
44002034	For David has not gone up into heaven , but says , himself , The Lord said to my Lord , Be seated at my right hand ,
44002035	Till I put all those who are against you under your feet .
44002036	For this reason , let all Israel be certain that this Jesus , whom you put to death on the cross , God has made Lord and Christ .
44002037	Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled , and they said to Peter and the other Apostles , Brothers , what are we to do ?
44002038	And Peter said , Let your hearts be changed , every one of you , and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ , for the forgiveness of your sins ; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you .
44002039	For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off , even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God .
44002040	And with more such words he gave his witness , offering them salvation and saying , Come out from this evil generation .
44002041	Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism : and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day .
44002042	And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles ' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer .
44002043	But fear came on every soul : and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles .
44002044	And all those who were of the faith kept together , and had all things in common ;
44002045	And exchanging their goods and property for money , they made division of it among them all , as they had need .
44002046	And day by day , going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and , taking broken bread together in their houses , they took their food with joy and with true hearts ,
44002047	Giving praise to God , and having the approval of all the people ; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord .
44003001	Now Peter and John were going up to the Temple at the ninth hour , the hour of prayer ;
44003002	And a certain man who from birth had had no power in his legs , was taken there every day , and put down at the door of the Temple which is named Beautiful , requesting money from those who went into the Temple ;
44003003	He then , seeing Peter and John going into the Temple , made a request to them .
44003004	And Peter , looking at him , with John , said , Keep your eyes on us .
44003005	And he gave attention to them , hoping to get something from them .
44003006	But Peter said , I have no silver or gold , but what I have , that I give to you . In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , get up on your feet .
44003007	And he took him by his right hand , lifting him up ; and straight away his feet and the bones of his legs became strong ,
44003008	And , jumping up , he got on to his feet and went into the Temple with them , walking and jumping and giving praise to God .
44003009	And all the people saw him walking and praising God :
44003010	And they saw that it was the man who made requests for money at the door of the Temple , and they were full of wonder and surprise at what had taken place .
44003011	And while he kept his hands on Peter and John , all the people came running together to the covered way which is named Solomon's , full of wonder .
44003012	And when Peter saw it he said to the people , You men of Israel , why are you so greatly surprised at this man ? or why are you looking at us as if by our power or virtue we had given him the use of his legs ?
44003013	The God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , has given glory to his servant Jesus ; whom you gave up , turning your backs on him , when Pilate had made the decision to let him go free .
44003014	But you would have nothing to do with the Holy and Upright One , and made request for a man of blood to be given to you ,
44003015	And put to death the Lord of life ; whom God gave back from the dead ; of which fact we are witnesses .
44003016	And his name , through faith in his name , has made this man strong , whom you see and have knowledge of : yes , the faith which is through him has made him well , before you all .
44003017	And now , my brothers , I am conscious that you did this , as did your rulers , without knowledge .
44003018	But the things which God had made clear before , by the mouth of all the prophets , that the Christ would have to undergo , he has put into effect in this way .
44003019	So then , let your hearts be changed and be turned to God , so that your sins may be completely taken away , and times of blessing may come from the Lord ;
44003020	And that he may send the Christ who was marked out for you from the first , even Jesus :
44003021	Who is to be kept in heaven till the time when all things are put right , of which God has given word by the mouth of his holy prophets , who have been from the earliest times .
44003022	For Moses said , The Lord will give you a prophet from among your people , like me ; you will give ear to everything which he will say to you .
44003023	And every soul who does not give attention to that prophet , will be cut off from among the people .
44003024	And all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after , every one of them , gave word of these days .
44003025	You are the sons of the prophets , and of the agreement which God made with your fathers , saying to Abraham , Through your seed a blessing will come on all the families of the earth .
44003026	To you , first , God sent his servant , blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins .
44004001	And while they were talking to the people , the priests and the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees came up to them ,
44004002	Being greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and preaching Jesus as an example of the coming back from the dead .
44004003	And they took them and put them in prison till the morning , for it was now evening .
44004004	But a number of those who gave hearing to the word had faith ; and they were now about five thousand .
44004005	And on the day after , the rulers and those in authority and the scribes came together in Jerusalem ;
44004006	And Annas , the high priest , was there , and Caiaphas and John and Alexander , and all the relations of the high priest .
44004007	Then sending for Peter and John , they said , By what power and in whose name have you done this ?
44004008	Then Peter , being full of the Holy Spirit , said to them , O you rulers of the people and men of authority ,
44004009	If we are questioned today about a good work done to a man who was ill , as to how he has been made well ,
44004010	Take note , all of you , and all the people of Israel , that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom you put to death on the cross , whom God gave back from the dead , even through him is this man now before you completely well .
44004011	He is the stone which you builders had no use for , but which has been made the chief stone of the building .
44004012	And in no other is there salvation : for there is no other name under heaven , given among men , through which we may have salvation .
44004013	Now when they saw that Peter and John were without fear , though they were men of no education or learning , they were greatly surprised ; and they took note of them that they had been with Jesus .
44004014	And , seeing that the man who had been made well was there with them , they were not able to say anything against it .
44004015	But when they had given them orders to go out of the Sanhedrin , they had a discussion among themselves ,
44004016	Saying , What are we to do with these men ? for certainly it is clear to all who are living in Jerusalem that a most important sign has been done by them , and it is not possible to say that it is not so .
44004017	But so that it may not go farther among the people , let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name .
44004018	And they sent for them , and gave them orders not to make statements or give teaching in the name of Jesus .
44004019	But Peter and John in answer said to them , It is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of God to give attention to you more than to God :
44004020	For it is not possible for us to keep from saying what we have seen and have knowledge of .
44004021	And when they had said more sharp words to them , they let them go , not seeing what punishment they might give them , because of the people ; for all men were giving praise to God for what had taken place .
44004022	For the man on whom this act of power was done was more than forty years old .
44004023	And when they had been made free , they came back to their friends , and gave an account of all the things which the chief priests and the authorities had said to them .
44004024	And hearing it , they all , with one mind , made prayer to God and said , O Lord , maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them :
44004025	Who has said , by the Holy Spirit , through the mouth of our father David your servant , Why are the nations so violently moved , and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish ?
44004026	The kings of the earth were lifted up , the rulers came together , against the Lord , and against his Christ :
44004027	For , truly , in this town , against your holy servant , Jesus , who was marked out by you as Christ , Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles and the people of Israel , came together ,
44004028	To do that which had been fixed before by your hand and your purpose .
44004029	And now , Lord , take note of their cruel words , and give your servants power to be preachers of your word without fear ,
44004030	While your hand is stretched out to do works of mercy ; so that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus .
44004031	And when their prayer was ended , the place where they were was violently moved , and they all became full of the Holy Spirit , preaching the word of God without fear .
44004032	And all those who were of the faith were one in heart and soul : and not one of them said that any of the things which he had was his property only ; but they had all things in common .
44004033	And with great power the Apostles gave witness of the coming back of the Lord Jesus from the dead ; and grace was on them all .
44004034	And no one among them was in need ; for everyone who had land or houses , exchanging them for money , took the price of them ,
44004035	And put it at the feet of the Apostles for distribution to everyone as he had need .
44004036	And Joseph , who was given by the Apostles the name of Barnabas ( the sense of which is , Son of comfort ) , a Levite and a man of Cyprus by birth ,
44004037	Having a field , got money for it and put the money at the feet of the Apostles .
44005001	But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , got money for his property ,
44005002	And kept back part of the price , his wife having knowledge of it , and took the rest and put it at the feet of the Apostles .
44005003	But Peter said , Ananias , why has the Evil One put it into your heart to be false to the Holy Spirit , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
44005004	While you had it , was it not your property ? and after you had given it in exchange , was it not still in your power ? how has this purpose come into your mind ? you have been false , not to men , but to God .
44005005	And at these words , Ananias went down on the earth , and his life went from him : and great fear came on all who were present .
44005006	And the young men went and made ready his body , and took it out , and put it in the earth .
44005007	And about three hours after , his wife , having no knowledge of what had taken place , came in .
44005008	And Peter said to her , Give me an answer : was this amount of money the price of the land ? And she said , Yes , it was .
44005009	But Peter said to her , Why have you made an agreement together to be false to the Spirit of the Lord ? See , the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth , are at the door , and they will take you out .
44005010	And straight away she went down at his feet , and her life went from her : and the young men came in and saw her dead , and they took her out and put her in the earth with her husband .
44005011	Then great fear came on all the church and on all who had knowledge of these things .
44005012	Now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles ; and they were all together in Solomon's covered way .
44005013	The others , in fear , kept back from joining them : but the people made much of them ;
44005014	And a great number of men and women had faith , and were joined to the Lord ;
44005015	And they even took into the streets people who were ill , and put them on beds , so that when Peter went by , some of them might be in his shade .
44005016	And numbers of people came together from the towns round about Jerusalem , with those who were ill and those who were troubled with unclean spirits : and they were all made well .
44005017	But the high priest and those who were with him ( the Sadducees ) were full of envy ,
44005018	And they took the Apostles and put them in the common prison .
44005019	But in the night an angel of the Lord , opening the doors of the prison , took them out and said ,
44005020	Go , take your place in the Temple and give the people all the teaching about this Life .
44005021	And hearing this , they went into the Temple at dawn , and were teaching . But the high priest and those who were with him got together the Sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of Israel , and sent to the prison to get them .
44005022	But the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison , and came back with the news ,
44005023	Saying , The doors of the prison were safely shut , and the keepers were at the doors , but when they were open , there was nobody inside .
44005024	Now , at these words , the captain of the Temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business .
44005025	And someone came and said to them , The men , whom you put in prison , are in the Temple teaching the people .
44005026	Then the captain and some of the police went and took them , but not violently , for fear that they might be stoned by the people .
44005027	And they took them into the Sanhedrin , and the high priest said to them ,
44005028	We gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name : and now Jerusalem is full of your teaching , and you are attempting to make us responsible for this man's death .
44005029	But Peter and the Apostles , answering , said , We have to do the orders of God , not of man .
44005030	The God of our fathers gave Jesus back to life , whom you had put to death , hanging him on a tree .
44005031	Him God has put on high at his right hand , as a Ruler and a Saviour , to give to Israel a change of heart and forgiveness of sins .
44005032	And we are witnesses of these things , and so is the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to those who keep his laws .
44005033	But when these words came to their ears , they were cut to the heart , and had a mind to put them to death .
44005034	But one of the Sanhedrin , a Pharisee named Gamaliel , a man of learning in the law , of whom all the people had a high opinion , got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time .
44005035	And he said to them , Men of Israel , take care what you do about these men .
44005036	For before this there was Theudas , who said he was someone important , to whom about four hundred men gave their support : he was put to death , and his band was broken up and came to nothing .
44005037	After this man , there was Judas of Galilee , at the time of the numbering , and some of the people went after him : he was put to death , and all his supporters were put to flight .
44005038	And now I say to you , Do nothing to these men , but let them be : for if this teaching or this work is of men , it will come to nothing :
44005039	But if it is of God , you will not be able to overcome them , and you are in danger of fighting against God .
44005040	And he seemed to them to be right : and they sent for the Apostles , and , after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of Jesus , they let them go .
44005041	So they went away from the Sanhedrin , happy to undergo shame for the Name .
44005042	And every day , in the Temple and privately , they went on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ .
44006001	Now in those days , when the number of the disciples was increasing , protests were made by the Greek Jews against the Hebrews , because their widows were not taken care of in the distribution of food every day .
44006002	And the Apostles sent for all the disciples and said , It is not right for us to give up preaching the word of God in order to make distribution of food .
44006003	Take then from among you seven men of good name , full of the Spirit and of wisdom , to whom we may give control of this business .
44006004	Then we will give all our time to prayer and the teaching of the word .
44006005	And this saying was pleasing to all of them : and they made selection of Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit , and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas of Antioch , who had become a Jew :
44006006	These they took to the Apostles , who , after prayer , put their hands on them .
44006007	And the word of God was increasing in power ; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem became very great , and a great number of priests were in agreement with the faith .
44006008	And Stephen , full of grace and power , did great wonders and signs among the people .
44006009	But some of those who were of the Synagogue named that of the Libertines , and some of the men of Cyrene and of Alexandria and those from Cilicia and Asia , had arguments with Stephen .
44006010	But they were not able to get the better of him , for his words were full of wisdom and of the Spirit .
44006011	Then they got men to say , He has said evil against Moses and against God , in our hearing .
44006012	And the people , with the rulers and the scribes , were moved against him , and they came and took him before the Sanhedrin ,
44006013	And they got false witnesses who said , This man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law :
44006014	For he has said in our hearing that this Jesus of Nazareth will put this place to destruction and make changes in the rules which were handed down to us by Moses .
44006015	And all those who were in the Sanhedrin , looking at him , saw that his face was like the face of an angel .
44007001	Then the high priest said , Are these things true ?
44007002	And he said , My brothers and fathers , give hearing . The God of glory came to our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he was living in Haran ,
44007003	And said to him , Go out of your land , and away from your family , and come into the land to which I will be your guide .
44007004	Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and went into Haran ; and from there , when his father was dead , he was guided by God into this land , where you are living now :
44007005	And God gave him no heritage in it , not even enough to put his foot on : but he gave him an undertaking that he would give it to him and to his children after him , though he had no child at that time .
44007006	And God said that his seed would be living in a strange land , and that they would make them servants , and be cruel to them for four hundred years .
44007007	And I will be the judge , said God , of that nation which made them servants : and after that , they will come out and give me worship in this place .
44007008	And he made with him the agreement of which circumcision was the sign . And so Abraham had a son , Isaac , and gave him circumcision on the eighth day ; and Isaac had a son , Jacob , and Jacob was the father of the twelve heads of the families of Israel .
44007009	And the brothers , moved with envy against Joseph , gave him to the Egyptians for money : but God was with him ,
44007010	And made him free from all his troubles , and gave him wisdom and the approval of Pharaoh , king of Egypt , who made him ruler over Egypt and all his house .
44007011	Now there was no food to be had in all Egypt and Canaan , and there was great trouble : and our fathers were not able to get food .
44007012	But Jacob , hearing that there was grain in Egypt , sent out our fathers the first time .
44007013	And the second time his brothers had a meeting with Joseph , and Pharaoh had knowledge of Joseph's family .
44007014	Then Joseph sent for Jacob his father and all his family , seventy-five persons .
44007015	And Jacob went down to Egypt , and came to his end there , and so did our fathers ;
44007016	And they were taken over to Shechem , and put to rest in the place which Abraham got for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem .
44007017	But when the time was near for putting into effect the undertaking which God had given to Abraham , the people were increasing in Egypt ,
44007018	Till another king came to power , who had no knowledge of Joseph .
44007019	He , having evil designs against our nation , was cruel to our fathers , and they were forced to put out their young children , so that they might not go on living .
44007020	At which time Moses came to birth , and he was very beautiful ; and he was kept for three months in his father's house :
44007021	And when he was put out , Pharaoh's daughter took him and kept him as her son .
44007022	And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of Egypt , and was great in his words and works .
44007023	But when he was almost forty years old , it came into his heart to go and see his brothers , the children of Israel .
44007024	And seeing one of them being attacked , he went to his help and gave the Egyptian a death-blow :
44007025	And he was hoping that his brothers would see that God had sent him to be their saviour ; but they did not see .
44007026	And the day after , he came to them , while they were having a fight , and would have made peace between them , saying , Sirs , you are brothers ; why do you do wrong to one another ?
44007027	But the man who was doing wrong to his neighbour , pushing him away , said , Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
44007028	Will you put me to death as you did the Egyptian yesterday ?
44007029	And at these words , Moses went in flight to the land of Midian , and was living there for a time , and had two sons .
44007030	At the end of forty years , an angel came to him in the waste land of Sinai , in the flame of a burning thorn-tree .
44007031	And Moses , seeing it , was full of wonder , and when he came up to have a nearer view of it , the voice of the Lord came to him , saying ,
44007032	I am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob . And Moses , shaking with fear , kept his eyes from looking at it .
44007033	And the Lord said , Take off the shoes from your feet , for the place where you are is holy .
44007034	Truly , I have seen the sorrows of my people in Egypt , and their cries have come to my ears , and I have come down to make them free : and now , come , I will send you to Egypt .
44007035	This Moses , whom they would not have , saying , Who made you a ruler and a judge ? him God sent to be a ruler and a saviour , by the hand of the angel whom he saw in the thorn-tree .
44007036	This man took them out , having done wonders and signs in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the waste land , for forty years .
44007037	This is the same Moses , who said to the children of Israel , God will give you a prophet from among your brothers , like me .
44007038	This is the man who was in the church in the waste land with the angel who was talking to him in Sinai , and with our fathers ; and to him were given the living words of God , so that he might give them to you .
44007039	By whom our fathers would not be controlled ; but they put him on one side , turning back in their hearts to Egypt ,
44007040	And saying to Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : as for this Moses , who took us out of the land of Egypt , we have no idea what has become of him .
44007041	And they made the image of a young ox in those days , and made an offering to it , and had joy in the work of their hands .
44007042	But God was turned from them and let them give worship to the stars of heaven , as it says in the book of the prophets , Did you make offerings to me of sheep and oxen for forty years in the waste land , O house of Israel ?
44007043	And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan , images which you made to give worship to them : and I will take you away , farther than Babylon .
44007044	Our fathers had the Tent of witness in the waste land , as God gave orders to Moses to make it after the design which he had seen .
44007045	Which our fathers , in their turn , took with them when , with Joshua , they came into the heritage of the nations whom God was driving out before the face of our fathers , till the time of David ,
44007046	Who was pleasing to God ; and he had a desire to make a holy tent for the God of Jacob .
44007047	But Solomon was the builder of his house .
44007048	But still , the Most High has not his resting-place in houses made with hands , as the prophet says ,
44007049	Heaven is the seat of my power , and earth is a resting-place for my feet : what sort of house will you make for me , says the Lord , or what is my place of rest ?
44007050	Did not my hand make all these things ?
44007051	You whose hearts are hard and whose ears are shut to me ; you are ever working against the Holy Spirit ; as your fathers did , so do you .
44007052	Which of the prophets was not cruelly attacked by your fathers ? and they put to death those who gave them the news of the coming of the Upright One ; whom you have now given up and put to death ;
44007053	You , to whom the law was given as it was ordered by angels , and who have not kept it .
44007054	Hearing these things , they were cut to the heart and moved with wrath against him .
44007055	But he was full of the Holy Spirit , and looking up to heaven , he saw the glory of God and Jesus at the right hand of God .
44007056	And he said , Now I see heaven open , and the Son of man at the right hand of God .
44007057	But with loud cries , and stopping their ears , they made an attack on him all together ,
44007058	Driving him out of the town and stoning him : and the witnesses put their clothing at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	And Stephen , while he was being stoned , made prayer to God , saying , Lord Jesus , take my spirit .
44007060	And going down on his knees , he said in a loud voice , Lord , do not make them responsible for this sin . And when he had said this , he went to his rest .
44008001	And Saul gave approval to his death . Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in Jerusalem ; and all but the Apostles went away into all parts of Judaea and Samaria .
44008002	And God-fearing men put Stephen's body in its last resting-place , making great weeping over him .
44008003	But Saul was burning with hate against the church , going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison .
44008004	But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word .
44008005	And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ .
44008006	And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said , when they saw the signs which he did .
44008007	For unclean spirits came out from those who had them , crying with a loud voice ; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well .
44008008	And there was much joy in that town .
44008009	But there was a certain man named Simon , who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria , saying that he himself was a great man :
44008010	To whom they all gave attention , from the smallest to the greatest , saying , This man is that power of God which is named Great .
44008011	And they gave attention to him , because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control .
44008012	But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , a number of men and women had baptism .
44008013	And Simon himself had faith and , having had baptism , he went with Philip and , seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did , he was full of surprise .
44008014	Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts , they sent to them Peter and John ;
44008015	Who , when they came there , made prayer for them , that the Holy Spirit might be given to them :
44008016	For up to that time he had not come on any of them ; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Then they put their hands on them , and the Holy Spirit came on them .
44008018	Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles ' hands , he made them an offering of money , saying ,
44008019	Give me this power , so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit .
44008020	But Peter said , May your money come to destruction with you , because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price .
44008021	You have no part in this business , because your heart is not right before God .
44008022	Let your heart be changed , and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts .
44008023	For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin .
44008024	And Simon , answering , said , Make prayer for me to the Lord , so that these things which you have said may not come on me .
44008025	So they , having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord , went back to Jerusalem , giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria .
44008026	But an angel of the Lord said to Philip , Get up , and go to the south , to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza , through the waste land .
44008027	And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia , a servant of great authority under Candace , queen of the Ethiopians , and controller of all her property , who had come up to Jerusalem for worship ;
44008028	He was going back , seated in his carriage , and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	And the Spirit said to Philip , Go near , and get on his carriage .
44008030	And Philip , running up to him , saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet , and said to him , Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you ?
44008031	And he said , How is that possible when I have no guide ? And he made Philip get up by his side .
44008032	Now the place in the book where he was reading was this : He was taken , like a sheep , to be put to death ; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut , so he made no sound :
44008033	Being of low degree , his cause was not given a hearing : who has knowledge of his family ? for his life is cut off from the earth .
44008034	And the Ethiopian said to Philip , About whom are these words said by the prophet ? about himself , or some other ?
44008035	So Philip , starting from this writing , gave him the good news about Jesus .
44008036	And while they were going on their way , they came to some water , and the Ethiopian said , See , here is water ; why may I not have baptism ?
44008038	And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped , and the two of them went down into the water , and Philip gave him baptism .
44008039	And when they came up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away ; and the Ethiopian saw him no more , for he went on his way full of joy .
44008040	But Philip came to Azotus , and went through all the towns , preaching the good news , till he came to Caesarea .
44009001	But Saul , still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
44009002	And made a request for letters from him to the Synagogues of Damascus , so that if there were any of the Way there , men or women , he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem .
44009003	And while he was journeying , he came near Damascus ; and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him ;
44009004	And he went down on the earth , and a voice said to him , Saul , Saul , why are you attacking me so cruelly ?
44009005	And he said , Who are you , Lord ? And he said , I am Jesus , whom you are attacking :
44009006	But get up , and go into the town , and it will be made clear to you what you have to do .
44009007	And the men who were with him were not able to say anything ; hearing the voice , but seeing no one .
44009008	And Saul got up from the earth , and when his eyes were open , he saw nothing ; and he was guided by the hand into Damascus .
44009009	And for three days he was not able to see , and he took no food or drink .
44009010	Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and the Lord said to him in a vision , Ananias ! and he said , Here I am , Lord .
44009011	And the Lord said to him , Get up , and go to the street which is named Straight , and make search at the house of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus : for he is at prayer ;
44009012	And he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him , so that he may be able to see .
44009013	But Ananias said , Lord , I have had accounts of this man from a number of people , how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem :
44009014	And here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name .
44009015	But the Lord said , Go without fear : for he is a special vessel for me , to give to the Gentiles and kings and to the children of Israel the knowledge of my name :
44009016	For I will make clear to him what troubles he will have to undergo for me .
44009017	And Ananias went out and came to the house , and putting his hands on him , said , Brother Saul , the Lord Jesus , whom you saw when you were on your journey , has sent me , so that you may be able to see , and be full of the Holy Spirit .
44009018	And straight away it seemed as if a veil was taken from his eyes , and he was able to see ; and he got up , and had baptism ;
44009019	And when he had taken food his strength came back . And for some days he kept with the disciples who were in Damascus .
44009020	And straight away , in the Synagogues , he was preaching Jesus as the Son of God .
44009021	And all those hearing him were full of wonder and said , Is not this the man who in Jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name ? and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests .
44009022	But Saul went on increasing in power , and the Jews in Damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that Jesus was the Christ .
44009023	Then , after some days , the Jews made an agreement together to put him to death :
44009024	But Saul got knowledge of their design . And they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town , so that they might put him to death :
44009025	But his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket .
44009026	And when he came to Jerusalem , he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples , but they were all in fear of him , not taking him for a disciple .
44009027	But Barnabas took him to the Apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the Lord on the road , and had given hearing to his words , and how at Damascus he had been preaching in the name of Jesus without fear .
44009028	And he was with them , going in and out at Jerusalem ,
44009029	Preaching in the name of the Lord without fear ; and he had discussions with the Greek Jews ; but they were working for his death .
44009030	And when the brothers had knowledge of it , they took him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus .
44009031	And so the church through all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was made strong ; and , living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit , was increased greatly .
44009032	And it came about that while Peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at Lydda .
44009033	And there was a certain man there , named Aeneas , who for eight years had been in bed , without power of moving .
44009034	And Peter said to him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ makes you well : get up and make your bed . And straight away he got up .
44009035	And all those living in Lydda and Sharon saw him , and were turned to the Lord .
44009036	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , that is , Dorcas : this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times .
44009037	And it came about , in those days , that she got ill and came to her death : and when she had been washed , they put her in a room which was high up .
44009038	And because Lydda was near Joppa , the disciples , having knowledge that Peter was there , sent two men to him , requesting him to come to them straight away .
44009039	And Peter went with them . And when he had come , they took him into the room : and all the widows were there , weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which Dorcas had made while she was with them .
44009040	But Peter made them all go outside , and went down on his knees in prayer ; and turning to the body , he said , Tabitha , get up . And , opening her eyes , she saw Peter and got up .
44009041	And he took her hand , lifting her up ; and , sending for the saints and widows , he gave her to them , living .
44009042	And news of it went all through Joppa , and a number of people had faith in the Lord .
44009043	And he was living in Joppa for some time with Simon , a leather-worker .
44010001	Now there was a certain man in Caesarea , named Cornelius , the captain of the Italian band of the army ;
44010002	A serious-minded man , fearing God with all his family ; he gave much money to the poor , and made prayer to God at all times .
44010003	He saw in a vision , clearly , at about the ninth hour of the day , an angel of the Lord coming to him and saying to him , Cornelius !
44010004	And he , looking on him in fear , said , What is it , Lord ? And he said to him , Your prayers and your offerings have come up to God , and he has kept them in mind .
44010005	Now send men to Joppa , and get one Simon , named Peter ,
44010006	Who is living with Simon , a leather-worker , whose house is by the sea .
44010007	And when the angel who said these words to him had gone away , he sent for two of his house-servants , and a God-fearing man of the army , one of those who were waiting on him at all times ;
44010008	And having given them an account of everything , he sent them to Joppa .
44010009	Now the day after , when they were on their journey and were near the town , Peter went up to the top of the house for prayer , about the sixth hour :
44010010	And he was in need of food : but while they were getting it ready , a deep sleep came on him ;
44010011	And he saw the heavens opening , and a vessel coming down , like a great cloth let down on the earth ,
44010012	In which were all sorts of beasts and birds .
44010013	And a voice came to him , saying , Come , Peter ; take them for food .
44010014	But Peter said , No , Lord ; for I have never taken food which is common or unclean .
44010015	And the voice came to him a second time , What God has made clean , do not you make common .
44010016	And this was done three times : and then the vessel was taken back into heaven .
44010017	Now while Peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision , the men who were sent by Cornelius , having made search for Simon's house , came to the door ,
44010018	To see if Simon , named Peter , was living there .
44010019	And , while Peter was turning the vision over in his mind , the Spirit said to him , See , three men are looking for you .
44010020	Go down , then , and go with them , doubting nothing , for I have sent them .
44010021	And Peter went down to the men , and said , I am the man you are looking for : why have you come ?
44010022	And they said , Cornelius , a captain , an upright and God-fearing man , respected by all the nation of the Jews , had word from God by an angel to send for you to his house , and to give hearing to your words .
44010023	So he took them in for the night . And the day after , he went with them , taking some of the brothers from Joppa with him .
44010024	And the day after that , they came to Caesarea . And Cornelius was waiting for them , having got together his relations and his near friends .
44010025	And when Peter came in , Cornelius came to him and , falling down at his feet , gave him worship .
44010026	But Peter , lifting him up , said , Get up , for I am a man as you are .
44010027	And saying these words , he went in , and saw that a great number of people had come together ;
44010028	And he said to them , You yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a Jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation ; but God has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean :
44010029	And so I came without question , when I was sent for . What then is your purpose in sending for me ?
44010030	And Cornelius said , Four days from now I was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour ; and I saw before me a man in shining clothing ,
44010031	Who said , Cornelius , your prayer has come to the ears of God , and your offerings are kept in his memory .
44010032	Send , then , to Joppa , and get Simon , named Peter , to come to you ; he is living in the house of Simon , a leather-worker , by the sea .
44010033	So , straight away , I sent for you ; and you have done well to come . And now , we are all present before God , ready to give attention to all the things which the Lord has given you to say .
44010034	Then Peter said , Truly , I see clearly that God is no respecter of persons :
44010035	But in every nation , the man who has fear of him and does righteousness is pleasing to him .
44010036	The word which he sent to the children of Israel , giving the good news of peace through Jesus Christ ( who is Lord of all ) - -
44010037	That word you yourselves have knowledge of , which was made public through all Judaea , starting from Galilee , after the baptism of which John was the preacher ,
44010038	About Jesus of Nazareth , how God gave the Holy Spirit to him , with power : and how he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits , for God was with him .
44010039	And we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem ; whom they put to death , hanging him on a tree .
44010040	On the third day God gave him back to life , and let him be seen ,
44010041	Not by all the people , but by witnesses marked out before by God , even by us , who took food and drink with him after he came back from the dead .
44010042	And he gave us orders to give news of this to the people , and to give public witness that this is he whom God has made judge of the living and the dead .
44010043	To him all the prophets give witness , that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins .
44010044	While Peter was saying these words , the Holy Spirit came on all those who were hearing the word .
44010045	And the Jews of the faith , who had come with Peter , were full of wonder , because the Holy Spirit was given to the Gentiles ,
44010046	And they were talking in tongues , and giving glory to God . Then Peter said ,
44010047	Will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the Holy Spirit as we have ?
44010048	And he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ . Then they kept him with them for some days .
44011001	Now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judaea had news that the word of God had been given to the Gentiles .
44011002	And when Peter came to Jerusalem , those who kept the rule of circumcision had an argument with him ,
44011003	Saying , You went to men without circumcision , and took food with them .
44011004	But Peter gave them an account of it all in order , saying to them ,
44011005	I was in the town of Joppa , at prayer : and falling into a deep sleep , I saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven , and it came down to me :
44011006	And looking on it with attention I saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds .
44011007	And a voice came to my ears saying , Come , Peter ; take them for food .
44011008	But I said , No , Lord ; for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth .
44011009	But the voice , coming a second time from heaven , said , What God has made clean , do not you make common .
44011010	And this was done three times , and they were all taken up again into heaven .
44011011	And at that minute , three men , sent from Caesarea , came to the house where we were .
44011012	And the Spirit gave me orders to go with them , doubting nothing . And these six brothers came with me ; and we went into that man's house :
44011013	And he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house , saying , Send to Joppa , and get Simon , named Peter , to come to you ;
44011014	Who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation .
44011015	And , while I was talking to them , the Holy Spirit came on them , as on us at first .
44011016	And the words of the Lord came into my mind , how he said , The baptism of John was with water , but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit .
44011017	If then God gave them , when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ , the same as he gave to us , who was I to go against God ?
44011018	And hearing these things they said nothing more , but gave glory to God , saying , Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart , so that they may have life .
44011019	Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen , went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus , preaching to the Jews only .
44011020	But some of them , men of Cyprus and Cyrene , when they came to Antioch , gave the good news about the Lord Jesus to the Greeks .
44011021	And the power of the Lord was with them , and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord .
44011022	And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem : and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch :
44011023	Who , when he came and saw the grace of God , was glad ; and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the Lord with all the strength of their hearts :
44011024	For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith : and a great number were joined to the Lord .
44011025	Then he went on to Tarsus , looking for Saul ;
44011026	And when he had come across him , he took him to Antioch . And they were with the church there for a year , teaching the people ; and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch .
44011027	Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch .
44011028	And one of them , named Agabus , said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth : which came about in the time of Claudius .
44011029	And the disciples , everyone as he was able , made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea :
44011030	Which they did , sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul .
44012001	Now , about that time , Herod the king made cruel attacks on the Christians .
44012002	And he put James , the brother of John , to death with the sword .
44012003	And when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he went on to take Peter in addition . This was at the time of the feast of unleavened bread .
44012004	And having taken him , he put him in prison , with four bands of armed men to keep watch over him ; his purpose being to take him out to the people after the Passover .
44012005	So Peter was kept in prison : but the church made strong prayer to God for him .
44012006	And when Herod was about to take him out , the same night Peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men , and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison .
44012007	And a great light was seen shining in the room , and an angel of the Lord came to Peter and , touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep , said , Get up quickly . And his chains came off his hands .
44012008	Then the angel said , Put on your shoes and get ready to go . And he did so . And he said , Put your coat round you and come with me .
44012009	And he went out after him ; and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact , for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision .
44012010	And when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town , which came open by itself : and they went out and down one street ; and then the angel went away .
44012011	And when Peter came to his senses he said , Now , truly , I am certain that the Lord has sent his angel and taken me out of the hands of Herod , against all the hopes of the Jews .
44012012	And when he became clear about this , he went to the house of Mary , the mother of John named Mark , where a number of them had come together for prayer .
44012013	And he gave a blow on the door , and a young girl came to it , named Rhoda .
44012014	And hearing the voice of Peter , in her joy she went running , without opening the door , to say that Peter was outside .
44012015	And they said to her , You are off your head . But still she said , with decision , that it was so . And they said , It is his angel .
44012016	But Peter went on giving blows on the door : and when it was open and they saw him , they were full of wonder .
44012017	But he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet , and gave them an account of how the Lord had taken him out of prison . And he said , Give the news to James and the brothers . And then he went away .
44012018	Now when it was day , the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of Peter .
44012019	And Herod , when he sent for him , and he was not there , after questioning the watchmen , gave orders that they were to be put to death . Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea for a time .
44012020	Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon : and they came to him , all together , and having made friends with Blastus , the controller of the king's house , they made a request for peace , because their country was dependent on the king's country for its food .
44012021	And on the day which had been fixed , Herod , dressed in his robes and seated in his place , made a public statement to them .
44012022	And the people , with loud cries , said , It is the voice of a god , not of a man .
44012023	And straight away the angel of the Lord sent a disease on him , because he did not give the glory to God : and his flesh was wasted away by worms , and so he came to his end .
44012024	But the word of the Lord went on increasing .
44012025	And Barnabas and Saul came back from Jerusalem , when their work was ended , taking with them John named Mark .
44013001	Now there were at Antioch , in the church there , prophets and teachers , Barnabas , and Symeon who was named Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , a relation of Herod the king , and Saul .
44013002	And while they were doing the Lord's work , and going without food , the Holy Spirit said , Let Barnabas and Saul be given to me for the special work for which they have been marked out by me .
44013003	Then , after prayer and going without food they put their hands on them , and sent them away .
44013004	So , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Seleucia ; and from there they went by ship to Cyprus .
44013005	And at Salamis they were preaching the word of God in the Synagogues of the Jews : and John was with them , helping them .
44013006	And when they had gone through all the island to Paphos , they came across a certain wonder-worker and false prophet , a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus ;
44013007	Who was with the ruler , Sergius Paulus , an able man . This man sent for Barnabas and Saul , desiring to have knowledge of the word of God .
44013008	But Elymas , the wonder-worker ( for that is the sense of his name ) , put himself against them , with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith .
44013009	But Saul , whose other name is Paul , being full of the Holy Spirit , looking hard at him , said ,
44013010	O you , who are full of false tricks and evil ways , a son of the Evil One , hating all righteousness , will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the Lord ?
44013011	And now , see , the hand of the Lord is on you , and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time . And straight away a dark mist came down on him ; and he went about looking for a guide .
44013012	Then the ruler , when he saw what was done , had faith , being full of wonder at the teaching of the Lord .
44013013	Then Paul and those who were with him went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia : and there John went away from them and came back to Jerusalem .
44013014	But they , going through from Perga , came to Antioch in Pisidia ; and they went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath and were seated .
44013015	And after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the Synagogue sent to them , saying , Brothers , if you have a word of comfort for the people , say on .
44013016	And Paul , getting up and making a sign with his hand , said , Men of Israel , and you who have the fear of God , give ear .
44013017	The God of this people Israel made selection of our fathers , lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of Egypt , and with a strong arm took them out of it .
44013018	And for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land .
44013019	And having put to destruction seven nations in the land of Canaan , he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years .
44013020	And after these things he gave them judges , till the time of Samuel the prophet .
44013021	Then at their request for a king , God gave them Saul , the son of Kish , a man of the family of Benjamin , who was their king for forty years .
44013022	And having put him on one side , he made David their king , to whom he gave witness , saying , I have taken David , the son of Jesse , a man dear to my heart , who will do all my pleasure .
44013023	From this man's seed has God given to Israel a Saviour , even Jesus , as he gave his word ;
44013024	For whose coming John made ready the way by preaching to all the people of Israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart .
44013025	And when John was completing his work , he said , What do I seem to you to be ? I am not he ; but one is coming after me , whose shoes I am not good enough to undo .
44013026	My brothers , children of the family of Abraham , and those among you who have the fear of God , to us the word of this salvation is sent .
44013027	For the men of Jerusalem and their rulers , having no knowledge of him , or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every Sabbath day , gave effect to them by judging him .
44013028	And though no cause of death was seen in him , they made a request to Pilate that he might be put to death .
44013029	And when they had done all the things said in the Writings about him , they took him down from the tree , and put him in the place of the dead .
44013030	But God gave him back from the dead :
44013031	And for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are now his witnesses before the people .
44013032	And we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers ,
44013033	Which God has now put into effect for our children , by sending Jesus ; as it says in the second Psalm , You are my Son ; this day I have given you being .
44013034	And about his coming back from the dead , never again to go to destruction , he has said these words , I will give you the holy and certain mercies of David .
44013035	Because he says in another Psalm , You will not let your Holy One see destruction .
44013036	Now David , having done God's work for his generation , went to sleep , and was put with his fathers , and his body came to destruction :
44013037	But he , who was lifted up by God , did not see destruction .
44013038	And so , let it be clear to you , my brothers , that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you :
44013039	And through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things , from which the law of Moses was not able to make you free .
44013040	So take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you ;
44013041	See , you doubters , have wonder and come to your end ; for I will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief , even if it is made clear to you .
44013042	And when they went out , they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the Sabbath after .
44013043	Now when the meeting was ended , a number of the Jews and of the God-fearing Gentiles who had become Jews , went after Paul and Barnabas : who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of God .
44013044	And on the Sabbath after , almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of God .
44013045	But when the Jews saw such a great number of people , they were full of envy and said evil words against Paul's preaching .
44013046	Then Paul and Barnabas without fear said , It was necessary for the word of God to be given to you first ; but because you will have nothing to do with it , and have no desire for eternal life , it will now be offered to the Gentiles .
44013047	For so the Lord has given us orders , saying , I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth .
44013048	And the Gentiles , hearing this , were glad and gave glory to the word of God : and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith .
44013049	And the word of the Lord went through all the country .
44013050	But the Jews , working up the feelings of the God-fearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town , got an attack started against Paul and Barnabas , driving them out of those parts .
44013051	But they , shaking off the dust of that place from their feet , came to Iconium .
44013052	And the disciples were full of joy and of the Holy Spirit .
44014001	Now in Iconium they went together to the Synagogue of the Jews and gave such teaching that a great number of Jews and Greeks had faith .
44014002	But those Jews who had not the faith , made the minds of the Gentiles bitter against the brothers .
44014003	So they kept there for a long time , taking heart in the Lord , who gave witness to the word of his grace by causing signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
44014004	But there was a division among the people of the town ; some were on the side of the Jews and some on the side of the Apostles .
44014005	And when a violent attempt was made by the Gentiles and the Jews , with their rulers , to make an attack on them and have them stoned ,
44014006	Having got news of it , they went in flight to the towns of Lycaonia , Lystra , and Derbe , and the country round about :
44014007	And went on preaching the good news there .
44014008	And at Lystra there was a certain man , who from birth had been without the use of his feet , never having had the power of walking .
44014009	This man was giving ear to the preaching of Paul , who , looking at him , and seeing that he had faith to be made well ,
44014010	Said in a loud voice , Get up on your feet . And , jumping up , he went walking about .
44014011	And when the people saw what Paul had done , they said in a loud voice , in the language of Lycaonia , The gods have come down to us in the form of men .
44014012	And they gave the name of Jupiter to Barnabas , and to Paul that of Mercury , because he was the chief talker .
44014013	And the priest of the image of Jupiter , which was before the town , took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town , and was about to make an offering with the people .
44014014	But when this came to the ears of the Apostles , Paul and Barnabas , they went running out among the people , parting their clothing , and crying out ,
44014015	Good people , why are you doing these things ? We are men with the same feelings as you , and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living God , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them :
44014016	Who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them .
44014017	But he was not without witness , because he did good , and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit , making your hearts full of food and joy .
44014018	And even with these words , it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them .
44014019	But some Jews came to that place from Antioch and Iconium , and got control over the people ; and after stoning Paul , they had him pulled out of the town , taking him for dead .
44014020	But when the disciples came round him , he got up and went into the town : and the day after he went away with Barnabas to Derbe .
44014021	And having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town , they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch ,
44014022	Making strong the souls of the disciples , saying to them that they were to keep the faith , and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of God .
44014023	And when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church , and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food , they put them into the care of the Lord in whom they had faith .
44014024	And they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia .
44014025	And , after preaching the word in Perga , they went down to Attalia ;
44014026	And from there they went by ship to Antioch , where they had been handed over to the grace of God for the work which they had not done .
44014027	And when they came there , and had got the church together , they gave them an account of all the things which God had done through them , and how he had made open a door of faith to the Gentiles .
44014028	And they were with the disciples there for a long time .
44015001	Now certain men came down from Judaea , teaching the brothers and saying that without circumcision , after the rule of Moses , there is no salvation .
44015002	And after Paul and Barnabas had had no little argument and discussion with them , the brothers made a decision to send Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem about this question .
44015003	So they , being sent on their way by the church , went through Phoenicia and Samaria , giving news of the salvation of the Gentiles , to the great joy of all the brothers .
44015004	And when they came to Jerusalem , they had a meeting with the church and the Apostles and the rulers , and they gave an account of all the things which God had done through them .
44015005	But some of the Pharisees , who were of the faith , got up and said , It is necessary for these to have circumcision and to keep the law of Moses .
44015006	And the Apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question .
44015007	And when there had been much discussion , Peter got up and said to them , My brothers , you have knowledge that some time back it was God's pleasure that by my mouth the good news might be given to the Gentiles so that they might have faith .
44015008	And God , the searcher of hearts , was a witness to them , giving them the Holy Spirit even as he did to us ;
44015009	Making no division between them and us , but making clean their hearts by faith .
44015010	Why then are you testing God , by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke so hard that not even our fathers or we were strong enough for it ?
44015011	But we have faith that we will get salvation through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way as they .
44015012	And all the people were quiet while Barnabas and Paul gave an account of the signs and wonders which God had done among the Gentiles by them .
44015013	And when they had come to an end , James , answering , said , My brothers , give ear to me :
44015014	Symeon has given an account of how God was first pleased to take from among the Gentiles a people for himself .
44015015	And this is in agreement with the words of the prophets , as it is said ,
44015016	After these things I will come back , and will put up the tent of David which has been broken down , building up again its broken parts and making it complete :
44015017	So that the rest of men may make search for the Lord , and all the Gentiles on whom my name is named ,
44015018	Says the Lord , who has made these things clear from the earliest times .
44015019	For this reason my decision is , that we do not put trouble in the way of those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God ;
44015020	But that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods , and from the evil desires of the body , and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law , and from blood .
44015021	For Moses , from times long past , has his preachers in every town , reading his law in the Synagogues every Sabbath .
44015022	Then it seemed good to the Apostles and the rulers and all the church , to send men from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; Judas , named Barsabbas , and Silas , chief men among the brothers :
44015023	And they sent a letter by them , saying , The Apostles and the older brothers , to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia , may joy be with you :
44015024	Because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words , putting your souls in doubt ; to whom we gave no such order ;
44015025	It seemed good to us , having come to an agreement together , to send these men to you , with our well loved Barnabas and Paul ,
44015026	Men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
44015027	And so we have sent Judas and Silas , who will say the same things to you themselves , by word of mouth .
44015028	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us , to put on you nothing more than these necessary things ;
44015029	To keep from things offered to false gods , and from blood , and from things put to death in ways which are against the law , and from the evil desires of the body ; if you keep yourselves from these , you will do well . May you be happy .
44015030	So they , being sent away , came down to Antioch , and having got the people together , they gave them the letter .
44015031	And after reading it , they were glad of its comfort .
44015032	And Judas and Silas , who themselves were prophets , gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith .
44015033	And when they had been there for some time , they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them .
44015035	But Paul and Barnabas kept on in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of God , with a number of others .
44015036	And after some days , Paul said to Barnabas , Let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of God , and see how they are .
44015037	And Barnabas had a desire to take with them John , named Mark .
44015038	But Paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in Pamphylia , and had not gone on with the work .
44015039	And there was a sharp argument between them , so that they were parted from one another , and Barnabas took Mark with him and went by ship to Cyprus ;
44015040	But Paul took Silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers .
44015041	And he went through Syria and Cilicia , making the churches stronger in the faith .
44016001	And he came to Derbe and Lystra : and there was a certain disciple there named Timothy , whose mother was one of the Jews of the faith , but his father was a Greek ;
44016002	Of whom the brothers at Lystra and Iconium had a high opinion .
44016003	Paul had a desire for him to go with him , and he gave him circumcision because of the Jews who were in those parts : for they all had knowledge that his father was a Greek .
44016004	And on their way through the towns , they gave them the rules which had been made by the Apostles and the rulers of the church at Jerusalem , so that they might keep them .
44016005	So the churches were made strong in the faith and were increased in number every day .
44016006	And after they had gone through the land of Phrygia and Galatia , the Holy Spirit did not let them take the word into Asia ;
44016007	And having come to Mysia , they made an attempt to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them ;
44016008	And going past Mysia , they came down to Troas .
44016009	And Paul had a vision in the night ; a man of Macedonia came , requesting him , and saying , Come over into Macedonia and give us help .
44016010	And when he had seen the vision , straight away we made the decision to go into Macedonia , for it seemed certain to us that God had sent us to give the good news to them .
44016011	So , from Troas we went straight by ship to Samothrace and the day after to Neapolis ;
44016012	And from there to Philippi , which is the most important town of Macedonia and a Roman colony : and we were there for some days .
44016013	And on the Sabbath we went outside the town , by the river , where we had an idea that there would be a place of prayer ; and , being seated , we had talk with the women who had come together .
44016014	And a certain woman named Lydia , a trader in purple cloth of the town of Thyatira , and a God-fearing woman , gave ear to us : whose heart the Lord made open to give attention to the things which Paul was saying .
44016015	And when she and her family had had baptism , she made a request to us , saying , If it seems to you that I am true to the Lord , come into my house and be my guests . And she made us come .
44016016	And when we were going to the place of prayer , we came across a girl with a spirit which gave knowledge of the future , whose masters made great profit from her power .
44016017	She came after Paul and us , crying out and saying , These men are the servants of the Most High God , who are giving you news of the way of salvation .
44016018	And this she did on a number of days . But Paul was greatly troubled and , turning , said to the spirit , I give you orders in the name of Jesus Christ , to come out of her . And it came out that very hour .
44016019	But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone , they took Paul and Silas , pulling them into the market-place before the rulers ;
44016020	And when they had taken them before the authorities , they said , These men , who are Jews , are greatly troubling our town ;
44016021	Teaching rules of living which it is not right for us to have or to keep , being Romans .
44016022	And the people made an attack on them all together : and the authorities took their clothing off them , and gave orders for them to be whipped .
44016023	And when they had given them a great number of blows , they put them in prison , giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely :
44016024	And he , having such orders , put them into the inner prison with chains on their feet .
44016025	But about the middle of the night , Paul and Silas were making prayers and songs to God in the hearing of the prisoners ;
44016026	And suddenly there was an earth-shock , so that the base of the prison was moved : and all the doors came open , and everyone's chains came off .
44016027	And the keeper , coming out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , took his sword and was about to put himself to death , fearing that the prisoners had got away .
44016028	But Paul said in a loud voice , Do yourself no damage , for we are all here .
44016029	And he sent for lights and came rushing in and , shaking with fear , went down on his face before Paul and Silas ,
44016030	And took them out and said , Sirs , what have I to do to get salvation ?
44016031	And they said , Have faith in the Lord Jesus , and you and your family will have salvation .
44016032	And they gave the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house .
44016033	And that same hour of the night , he took them , and when he had given attention to their wounds , he and all his family had baptism straight away .
44016034	And he took them into his house and gave them food , and he was full of joy , having faith in God with all his family .
44016035	But when it was day , the authorities sent the police , saying , Let these men go .
44016036	And the keeper said to Paul , The authorities have given orders to let you go : come out now , and go in peace .
44016037	But Paul said to them , They have given us who are Romans a public whipping without judging us , and have put us in prison . Will they now send us out secretly ? no , truly , let them come themselves and take us out .
44016038	And the police gave an account of these words to the authorities , and they were full of fear on hearing that they were Romans ;
44016039	Then they came and made prayers to them , requesting them , when they had taken them out , to go away from the town .
44016040	And they came out of the prison and went to the house of Lydia : and when they had seen the brothers they gave them comfort and went away .
44017001	Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica , where there was a Synagogue of the Jews :
44017002	And Paul , as he generally did , went in to them , and on three Sabbath days had discussions with them from the holy Writings ,
44017003	Saying to them clearly and openly that Christ had to be put to death and come back to life again ; and that this Jesus , whom , he said , I am preaching to you , is the Christ .
44017004	And some of them had faith , and were joined to Paul and Silas ; and a number of the God-fearing Greeks , and some of the chief women .
44017005	But the Jews , being moved with envy , took with them certain low persons from among the common people , and getting together a great number of people , made an outcry in the town , attacking the house of Jason with the purpose of taking them out to the people .
44017006	And when they were not able to get them , they took Jason and some of the brothers by force before the rulers of the town , crying , These men , who have made trouble all over the world have now come here ;
44017007	Whom Jason has taken into his house : and they are acting against the orders of Caesar , saying that there is another king , Jesus .
44017008	And hearing these things the people and the rulers of the town were troubled .
44017009	And having made Jason and the others give an undertaking to keep the peace , they let them go .
44017010	And the brothers straight away sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea : and they , when they came there , went to the Synagogue of the Jews .
44017011	Now these were more noble than the Jews of Thessalonica , for they gave serious attention to the word , searching in the holy Writings every day , to see if these things were so .
44017012	And a number of them had faith , and no small number of the Greek women of high position and of the men .
44017013	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had news that Paul was preaching the word at Beroea , they came there , troubling the people and working them up .
44017014	So the brothers sent Paul straight away to the sea : but Silas and Timothy kept there still .
44017015	But those who went with Paul took him as far as Athens , and then went away , with orders from him to Silas and Timothy to come to him quickly .
44017016	Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens , his spirit was troubled , for he saw all the town full of images of the gods .
44017017	So he had discussions in the Synagogue with the Jews and God-fearing Gentiles , and every day in the market-place with those who were there .
44017018	And some of those who were supporters of the theories of the Epicureans and the Stoics , had a meeting with him . And some said , What is this talker of foolish words saying ? And others , He seems to be a preacher of strange gods : because he was preaching of Jesus and his coming back from the dead .
44017019	And they took him to Mars ' Hill , saying , Will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours ?
44017020	For you seem to us to say strange things , and we have a desire to get the sense of them .
44017021	( Now all the Athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new . )
44017022	And Paul got to his feet on Mars ' Hill and said , O men of Athens , I see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods .
44017023	For when I came by , I was looking at the things to which you give worship , and I saw an altar with this writing on it , TO THE GOD OF WHOM THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE . Now , what you , without knowledge , give worship to , I make clear to you .
44017024	The God who made the earth and everything in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , is not housed in buildings made with hands ;
44017025	And he is not dependent on the work of men's hands , as if he had need of anything , for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things ;
44017026	And he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth , ordering their times and the limits of their lands ,
44017027	So that they might make search for God , in order , if possible , to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him , though he is not far from every one of us :
44017028	For in him we have life and motion and existence ; as certain of your verse writers have said , For we are his offspring .
44017029	If then we are the offspring of God , it is not right for us to have the idea that God is like gold or silver or stone , formed by the art or design of man .
44017030	Those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by God ; but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart :
44017031	Because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work ; of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead .
44017032	Now on hearing about the coming back from death , some of them made sport of it , but others said , Let us go more fully into this another time .
44017033	And so Paul went away from among them .
44017034	But some men gave him their support : among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
44018001	After these things , he went away from Athens , and came to Corinth .
44018002	And there he came across a certain Jew named Aquila , a man of Pontus by birth , who not long before had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Claudius had given orders that all Jews were to go away from Rome : and he came to them ;
44018003	And because he was of the same trade , he was living with them , and they did their work together ; for by trade they were tent-makers .
44018004	And every Sabbath he had discussions in the Synagogue , turning Jews and Greeks to the faith .
44018005	And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia , Paul was completely given up to the word , preaching to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus .
44018006	And when they put themselves against him , and said evil words , he said , shaking his clothing , Your blood be on your heads , I am clean : from now I will go to the Gentiles .
44018007	And moving from there , he went into the house of a man named Titus Justus , a God-fearing man , whose house was very near the Synagogue .
44018008	And Crispus , the ruler of the Synagogue , with all his family , had faith in the Lord ; and a great number of the people of Corinth , hearing the word , had faith and were given baptism .
44018009	And the Lord said to Paul in the night , in a vision , Have no fear and go on preaching :
44018010	For I am with you , and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage : for I have a number of people in this town .
44018011	And he was there for a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
44018012	But when Gallio was ruler of Achaia , all the Jews together made an attack on Paul , and took him to the judge's seat ,
44018013	Saying , This man is teaching the people to give worship to God in a way which is against the law .
44018014	But when Paul was about to say something , Gallio said to the Jews , If this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime , there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing :
44018015	But if it is a question of words or names or of your law , see to it yourselves ; I will not be a judge of such things .
44018016	And he sent them away from the judge's seat .
44018017	And they all made an attack on Sosthenes , the ruler of the Synagogue , and gave him blows before the judge's seat ; but Gallio gave no attention to these things .
44018018	And Paul , after waiting some days , went away from the brothers and went by ship to Syria , Priscilla and Aquila being with him ; and he had had his hair cut off in Cenchrea , for he had taken an oath .
44018019	And they came down to Ephesus and he left them there : and he himself went into the Synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews .
44018020	And being requested by them to be there for a longer time , he said , No ;
44018021	And went from them , saying , I will come back to you if God lets me ; and he took ship from Ephesus .
44018022	And when he had come to land at Caesarea , he went to see the church , and then went down to Antioch .
44018023	And having been there for some time , he went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , making the disciples strong in the faith .
44018024	Now a certain Jew named Apollos , an Alexandrian by birth , and a man of learning , came to Ephesus ; and he had great knowledge of the holy Writings .
44018025	This man had been trained in the way of the Lord ; and burning in spirit , he gave himself up to teaching the facts about Jesus , though he had knowledge only of John's baptism :
44018026	And he was preaching in the Synagogue without fear . But Priscilla and Aquila , hearing his words , took him in , and gave him fuller teaching about the way of God .
44018027	And when he had a desire to go over into Achaia , the brothers gave him help , and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them : and when he had come , he gave much help to those who had faith through grace :
44018028	For he overcame the Jews in public discussion , making clear from the holy Writings that the Christ was Jesus .
44019001	And it came about that while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul , having gone through the higher country , came to Ephesus , where there were certain disciples :
44019002	And he said to them , Did you get the Holy Spirit when you had faith ? And they said to him , No , we have had no knowledge of the Holy Spirit .
44019003	And he said , What sort of baptism did you have ? And they said , The baptism of John .
44019004	And Paul said , John gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart , saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him , that is , in Jesus .
44019005	And hearing this , they had baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	And when Paul had put his hands on them , the Holy Spirit came on them ; and they had the power of talking in tongues , and acting like prophets .
44019007	And there were about twelve of these men .
44019008	And he went into the Synagogue , and for three months he was preaching there without fear , reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of God .
44019009	But because some of the people were hard-hearted and would not give hearing , saying evil words about the Way before the people , he went away from them , and kept the disciples separate , reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus .
44019010	And this went on for two years , so that all those who were living in Asia had knowledge of the word of the Lord , Greeks as well as Jews .
44019011	And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul :
44019012	So that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill , and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out .
44019013	But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits , took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits , saying , I give you orders , by Jesus , whom Paul is preaching .
44019014	And there were seven sons of a man named Sceva , a Jew and a chief priest , who did this .
44019015	And the evil spirit , answering , said to them , I have knowledge of Jesus , and of Paul , but who are you ?
44019016	And the man in whom the evil spirit was , jumping on them , was stronger than the two of them , and overcame them , so that they went running from that house , wounded and without their clothing .
44019017	And this came to the ears of all those , Jews and Greeks , who were living at Ephesus ; and fear came on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was made great .
44019018	And a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts .
44019019	And a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone : and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver .
44019020	So the word of the Lord was increased very greatly and was full of power .
44019021	Now after these things were ended , Paul came to a decision that when he had gone through Macedonia and Achaia he would go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I have a desire to see Rome .
44019022	And having sent two of his helpers , Timothy and Erastus , into Macedonia , he himself went on living in Asia for a time .
44019023	And about that time a great outcry took place about the Way .
44019024	For there was a certain man named Demetrius , a silver-worker , who made silver boxes for the images of Diana , and gave no small profit to the workmen ;
44019025	Whom he got together , with other workmen of the same trade , and said to them , Men , it is clear that from this business we get our wealth .
44019026	And you see , for it has come to your ears , that not only at Ephesus , but almost all through Asia , this Paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away , saying that those are not gods who are made by men's hands :
44019027	And there is danger , not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men , but that the holy place of the great goddess Diana may be no longer honoured , and that she to whom all Asia and the world give worship , will be put down from her high position .
44019028	And hearing this , they were very angry , crying out and saying , Great is Diana of Ephesus .
44019029	And the town was full of noise and trouble , and they all came running into the theatre , having taken by force Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia who were journeying in company with Paul .
44019030	And when Paul was about to go in to the people , the disciples did not let him .
44019031	And some of the rulers of Asia , being his friends , sent to him , requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre .
44019032	And some said one thing , and some another : for there was no order in the meeting ; and most of them had no idea why they had come together .
44019033	Then they took Alexander out from among the people , the Jews putting him forward . And Alexander , making a sign with his hand , was about to make a statement to the people in answer :
44019034	But when they saw that he was a Jew , all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours , Great is Diana of Ephesus .
44019035	And when the chief secretary had got the people quiet , he said , Men of Ephesus , is any man without knowledge that the town of Ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great Diana , who was sent down from Jupiter ?
44019036	So then , because these things may not be doubted , it would be better for you to be quiet , and do nothing unwise .
44019037	For you have taken these men , who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess .
44019038	If , then , Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man , the law is open to them , and there are judges ; let them put up a cause at law against one another .
44019039	But if any other business is in question , let it be taken up in the regular meeting .
44019040	For , truly , we are in danger of being made responsible for this day's trouble , there being no cause for it : and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together .
44019041	And when he had said this , he sent the meeting away .
44020001	And after the noise had come to an end , Paul , having sent for the disciples and given them comfort , went away from them to Macedonia .
44020002	And when he had gone through those parts and given them much teaching , he came into Greece .
44020003	And when he had been there three months , because the Jews had made a secret design against him when he was about to take ship for Syria , he made a decision to go back through Macedonia .
44020004	And Sopater of Beroea , the son of Pyrrhus , and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica , and Gaius of Derbe , and Timothy , and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia , went with him as far as Asia .
44020005	But these had gone before , and were waiting for us at Troas .
44020006	And we went away from Philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread , and came to them at Troas in five days ; and we were there for seven days .
44020007	And on the first day of the week , when we had come together for the holy meal , Paul gave them a talk , for it was his purpose to go away on the day after ; and he went on talking till after the middle of the night .
44020008	And there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together .
44020009	And a certain young man named Eutychus , who was seated in the window , went into a deep sleep ; and while Paul went on talking , being overcome by sleep , he had a fall from the third floor , and was taken up dead .
44020010	And Paul went down and , falling on him , took him in his arms and said , Do not be troubled , for his life is in him .
44020011	And when he had gone up , and had taken the broken bread , he went on talking to them for a long time , even till dawn , and then he went away .
44020012	And they took the boy in , living , and were greatly comforted .
44020013	But we , going before him by ship , went to Assos with the purpose of taking Paul in there : for so he had given orders , because he himself was coming by land .
44020014	And when he came up with us at Assos , we took him in the ship and went on to Mitylene .
44020015	And going from there by sea , we came on the day after opposite Chios , and touching at Samos on the day after that , we came on the third day to Miletus .
44020016	For Paul's purpose was to go past Ephesus , so that he might not be kept in Asia ; for he was going quickly , in order , if possible , to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost .
44020017	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the rulers of the church .
44020018	And when they had come , he said to them , You yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when I first came into Asia ,
44020019	Doing the Lord's work without pride , through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the Jews :
44020020	And how I kept back nothing which might be of profit to you , teaching you publicly and privately ,
44020021	Preaching to Jews and to Greeks the need for a turning of the heart to God , and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ .
44020022	And now , as you see , I am going to Jerusalem , a prisoner in spirit , having no knowledge of what will come to me there :
44020023	Only that the Holy Spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me .
44020024	But I put no value on my life , if only at the end of it I may see the work complete which was given to me by the Lord Jesus , to be a witness of the good news of the grace of God .
44020025	And now I am conscious that you , among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom , will not see my face again .
44020026	And so I say to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men .
44020027	For I have not kept back from you anything of the purpose of God .
44020028	Give attention to yourselves , and to all the flock which the Holy Spirit has given into your care , to give food to the church of God , for which he gave his blood .
44020029	I am conscious that after I am gone , evil wolves will come in among you , doing damage to the flock ;
44020030	And from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching , turning away the disciples after them .
44020031	So keep watch , having in mind that for three years without resting I was teaching every one of you , day and night , with weeping .
44020032	And now , I give you into the care of God and the word of his grace , which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints .
44020033	I have had no desire for any man's silver or gold or clothing .
44020034	You yourselves have seen that with these hands I got what was necessary for me and those who were with me .
44020035	In all things I was an example to you of how , in your lives , you are to give help to the feeble , and keep in memory the words of the Lord Jesus , how he himself said , There is a greater blessing in giving than in getting .
44020036	And having said these words , he went down on his knees in prayer with them all .
44020037	And they were all weeping , falling on Paul's neck and kissing him ,
44020038	Being sad most of all because he had said that they would not see his face again . And so they went with him to the ship .
44021001	And after parting from them , we put out to sea and came straight to Cos , and the day after to Rhodes , and from there to Patara :
44021002	And as there was a ship going to Phoenicia , we went in it .
44021003	And when we had come in view of Cyprus , going past it on our left , we went on to Syria , and came to land at Tyre : for there the goods which were in the ship had to be taken out .
44021004	And meeting the disciples we were there for seven days : and they gave Paul orders through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem .
44021005	And when these days came to an end , we went on our journey ; and they all , with their wives and children , came with us on our way till we were out of the town : and after going on our knees in prayer by the sea ,
44021006	We said our last words to one another , and got into the ship , and they went back to their houses .
44021007	And journeying by ship from Tyre we came to Ptolemais ; and there we had talk with the brothers and were with them for one day .
44021008	And on the day after , we went away and came to Caesarea , where we were guests in the house of Philip , the preacher , who was one of the seven .
44021009	And he had four daughters , virgins , who were prophets .
44021010	And while we were waiting there for some days , a certain prophet , named Agabus , came down from Judaea .
44021011	And he came to us , and took the band of Paul's clothing , and putting it round his feet and hands , said , The Holy Spirit says these words , So will the Jews do to the man who is the owner of this band , and they will give him up into the hands of the Gentiles .
44021012	And hearing these things , we and those who were living in that place made request to him not to go to Jerusalem .
44021013	Then Paul said , What are you doing , weeping and wounding my heart ? for I am ready , not only to be a prisoner , but to be put to death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus .
44021014	And as he might not be moved we did no more , saying , Let the purpose of God be done .
44021015	And after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem .
44021016	And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us , taking a certain Mnason of Cyprus , one of the early disciples , in whose house we were to be living .
44021017	And when we came to Jerusalem , the brothers were pleased to see us .
44021018	And on the day after , Paul went with us to James , and all the rulers of the church were present .
44021019	And when he had said how glad he was to see them , he gave them a detailed account of the things which God had done through his work among the Gentiles .
44021020	And hearing it , they gave praise to God ; and they said to him , You see , brother , what thousands there are among the Jews , who have the faith ; and they all have a great respect for the law :
44021021	And they have had news of you , how you have been teaching all the Jews among the Gentiles to give up the law of Moses , and not to give circumcision to their children , and not to keep the old rules .
44021022	What then is the position ? They will certainly get news that you have come .
44021023	Do this , then , which we say to you : We have four men who have taken an oath ;
44021024	Go with these , and make yourself clean with them , and make the necessary payments for them , so that they may be free from their oath : and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true , but that you put yourself under rule , and keep the law .
44021025	But as to the Gentiles who have the faith , we sent a letter , giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods , and from blood , and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law , and from the evil desires of the body .
44021026	Then Paul took the men , and on the day after , making himself clean with them , he went into the Temple , giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete , till the offering was made for every one of them .
44021027	And when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews from Asia , seeing him in the Temple , got the people together and put their hands on him ,
44021028	Crying out , Men of Israel , come to our help : this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place : and in addition , he has taken Greeks into the Temple , and made this holy place unclean .
44021029	For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus , and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple .
44021030	And all the town was moved , and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul , pulling him out of the Temple : and then the doors were shut .
44021031	And while they were attempting to put him to death , news came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem was out of control .
44021032	And straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them : and the Jews , seeing them , gave no more blows to Paul .
44021033	Then the chief captain came near and took him , and gave orders for him to be put in chains , questioning them as to who he was and what he had done .
44021034	And some said one thing and some another , among the people : and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise , he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building .
44021035	And when he came on to the steps , he was lifted up by the armed men , because of the force of the people ;
44021036	For a great mass of people came after them , crying out , Away with him !
44021037	And when Paul was about to be taken into the building , he said to the chief captain , May I say something to you ? And he said , Have you a knowledge of Greek ?
44021038	Are you by chance the Egyptian who , before this , got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land ?
44021039	But Paul said , I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia , which is not an unimportant town : I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people .
44021040	And when he let him do so , Paul , from the steps , made a sign with his hand to the people , and when they were all quiet , he said to them in the Hebrew language ,
44022001	My brothers and fathers , give ear to the story of my life which I now put before you .
44022002	And , hearing him talking in the Hebrew language , they became the more quiet , and he said ,
44022003	I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia by birth , but I had my education in this town at the feet of Gamaliel , being trained in the keeping of every detail of the law of our fathers ; given up to the cause of God with all my heart , as you are today .
44022004	And I made attacks on this Way , even to death , taking men and women and putting them in prison .
44022005	Of which the high priest will be a witness , and all the rulers , from whom I had letters to the brothers ; and I went into Damascus , to take those who were there as prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment .
44022006	And it came about that while I was on my journey , coming near to Damascus , about the middle of the day , suddenly I saw a great light from heaven shining round me .
44022007	And when I went down on the earth , a voice came to my ears saying to me , Saul , Saul , why are you attacking me so cruelly ?
44022008	And I , answering , said , Who are you ; Lord ? And he said to me , I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you are attacking .
44022009	And those who were with me saw the light , but the voice of him who was talking to me came not to their ears .
44022010	And I said , What have I to do , Lord ? And the Lord said to me , Get up , and go into Damascus ; and it will be made clear to you what you have to do .
44022011	And because I was unable to see because of the glory of that light , those who were with me took me by the hand , and so I came to Damascus .
44022012	And one Ananias , a God-fearing man , who kept the law , and of whom all the Jews in that place had a high opinion ,
44022013	Came to my side and said , Brother Saul , let your eyes be open . And in that very hour I was able to see him .
44022014	And he said , You have been marked out by the God of our fathers to have knowledge of his purpose , and to see the Upright One and to give ear to the words of his mouth .
44022015	For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and of what has come to your ears .
44022016	And now , why are you waiting ? get up , and have baptism , for the washing away of your sins , giving worship to his name .
44022017	And it came about that when I had come back to Jerusalem , while I was at prayer in the Temple , my senses became more than naturally clear ,
44022018	And I saw him saying to me , Go out of Jerusalem straight away because they will not give hearing to your witness about me .
44022019	And I said , Lord , they themselves have knowledge that I went through the Synagogues putting in prison and whipping all those who had faith in you :
44022020	And when Stephen your witness was put to death , I was there , giving approval , and looking after the clothing of those who put him to death .
44022021	And he said to me , Go , for I will send you far away to the Gentiles .
44022022	And they gave him a hearing as far as this word ; then with loud voices they said , Away with this man from the earth ; it is not right for him to be living .
44022023	And while they were crying out , and pulling off their clothing , and sending dust into the air ,
44022024	The chief captain gave orders for him to be taken into the army building , saying that he would put him to the test by whipping , so that he might have knowledge of the reason why they were crying out so violently against him .
44022025	And when they had put leather bands round him , Paul said to the captain who was present , Is it the law for you to give blows to a man who is a Roman and has not been judged ?
44022026	And hearing this , the man went to the chief captain and gave him an account of it , saying , What are you about to do ? for this man is a Roman .
44022027	And the chief captain came to him and said , Give me an answer , are you a Roman ? And he said , Yes .
44022028	And the chief captain said , I got Roman rights for myself at a great price . And Paul said , But I had them by birth .
44022029	Then those who were about to put him to the test went away : and the chief captain was in fear , seeing that he was a Roman , and that he had put chains on him .
44022030	But on the day after , desiring to have certain knowledge of what the Jews had to say against him , he made him free , and gave orders for the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together , and he took Paul and put him before them .
44023001	And Paul , looking fixedly at the Sanhedrin , said , My brothers , my life has been upright before God till this day .
44023002	And the high priest , Ananias , gave orders to those who were near him to give him a blow on the mouth .
44023003	Then Paul said to him , God will give blows to you , you whitewashed wall : are you here to be my judge by law , and by your orders am I given blows against the law ?
44023004	And those who were near said , Do you say such words against God's high priest ?
44023005	And Paul said , Brother , I had no idea that he was the high priest : for it has been said , You may not say evil about the ruler of your people .
44023006	But when Paul saw that half of them were Sadducees and the rest Pharisees , he said in the Sanhedrin , Brothers , I am a Pharisee , and the son of Pharisees : I am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead .
44023007	And when he had said this , there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees , and a division in the meeting .
44023008	For the Sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead , and no angels or spirits : but the Pharisees have belief in all these .
44023009	And there was a great outcry : and some of the scribes on the side of the Pharisees got up and took part in the discussion , saying , We see no evil in this man : what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit ?
44023010	And when the argument became very violent , the chief captain , fearing that Paul would be pulled in two by them , gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them , and take him into the army building .
44023011	And the night after , the Lord came to his side and said , Be of good heart , for as you have been witnessing for me in Jerusalem , so will you be my witness in Rome .
44023012	And when it was day , the Jews came together and put themselves under an oath that they would take no food or drink till they had put Paul to death .
44023013	And more than forty of them took this oath .
44023014	And they came to the chief priests and the rulers and said , We have taken a great oath to take no food till we have put Paul to death
44023015	So now , will you and the Sanhedrin make a request to the military authorities to have him sent down to you , as if you were desiring to go into the business in greater detail ; and we , before ever he gets to you , will be waiting to put him to death .
44023016	But Paul's sister's son had word of their design , and he came into the army building and gave news of it to Paul .
44023017	And Paul sent for a captain and said , Take this young man to your chief , for he has news for him .
44023018	So he took him to the chief captain and said , Paul , the prisoner , made a request to me to take this young man to you , for he has something to say to you .
44023019	And the chief took him by the hand and , going on one side , said to him privately , What is it you have to say to me ?
44023020	And he said , The Jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for Paul to be taken , on the day after this , into the Sanhedrin , to be questioned in greater detail .
44023021	But do not give way to them , for more than forty of them are waiting for him , having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death : and now they are ready , waiting for your order .
44023022	So the chief captain let the young man go , saying to him , Do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things .
44023023	And he sent for two captains and said , Make ready two hundred men , with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen , to go to Caesarea , at the third hour of the night :
44023024	And get beasts so that they may put Paul on them , and take him safely to Felix , the ruler .
44023025	And he sent a letter in these words :
44023026	Claudius Lysias , to the most noble ruler , Felix , peace be with you .
44023027	This man was taken by the Jews , and was about to be put to death by them , when I came on them with the army and took him out of danger , having knowledge that he was a Roman .
44023028	And , desiring to get at the reason for their attack on him , I took him down to their Sanhedrin :
44023029	Then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law , and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death .
44023030	And when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man , I sent him straight away to you , giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you .
44023031	So the armed men , as they were ordered , took Paul and came by night to Antipatris .
44023032	But on the day after , they sent the horsemen on with him , and went back to their place :
44023033	And they , when they came to Caesarea , gave the letter to the ruler , and took Paul before him .
44023034	And after reading it , he said , What part of the country do you come from ? And , hearing that he was from Cilicia ,
44023035	I will give hearing to your cause , he said , when those who are against you have come . And he gave orders for him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium .
44024001	And after five days , the high priest , Ananias , came with certain of the rulers , and an expert talker , one Tertullus ; and they made a statement to Felix against Paul .
44024002	And when he had been sent for , Tertullus , starting his statement , said , Because by you we are living in peace , and through your wisdom wrongs are put right for this nation ,
44024003	In all things and in all places we are conscious of our great debt to you , most noble Felix .
44024004	But , so that I may not make you tired , I make a request to you of your mercy , to give hearing to a short statement .
44024005	For this man , in our opinion , is a cause of trouble , a maker of attacks on the government among Jews through all the empire , and a chief mover in the society of the Nazarenes :
44024006	Who , in addition , was attempting to make the Temple unclean : whom we took ,
44024008	And from whom you will be able , by questioning him yourself , to get knowledge of all the things which we say against him .
44024009	And the Jews were in agreement with his statement , saying that these things were so .
44024010	Then when the ruler had given him a sign to make his answer , Paul said , Because I have knowledge that you have been a judge over this nation for a number of years , I am glad to make my answer :
44024011	Seeing that you are able to make certain of the fact that it is not more than twelve days from the time when I came up to Jerusalem for worship ;
44024012	And they have not seen me in argument with any man in the Temple , or working up the feelings of the people , in the Synagogues or in the town :
44024013	And they are not able to give facts in support of the things which they say against me now .
44024014	But this I will say openly to you , that I do give worship to the God of our fathers after that Way , which to them is not the true religion : but I have belief in all the things which are in the law and in the books of the prophets :
44024015	Hoping in God for that which they themselves are looking for , that there will be a coming back from the dead for upright men and wrongdoers .
44024016	And in this , I do my best at all times to have no reason for shame before God or men .
44024017	Now after a number of years I came to give help and offerings to my nation :
44024018	And having been made clean , I was in the Temple , but not with a great number of people , and not with noise : but there were certain Jews from Asia ,
44024019	And it would have been better if they had come here to make a statement , if they have anything against me .
44024020	Or let these men here present say what wrongdoing was seen in me when I was before the Sanhedrin ,
44024021	But only this one thing which I said among them in a loud voice , I am this day being judged on the question of the coming back from the dead .
44024022	But Felix , who had a more detailed knowledge of the Way , put them off , saying , When Lysias , the chief captain , comes down , I will give attention to your business .
44024023	And he gave orders to the captain to keep Paul under his control , and to let him have everything he had need of ; and not to keep his friends from coming to see him .
44024024	But after some days , Felix came with Drusilla his wife , who was of the Jews by birth , and sent for Paul , and gave hearing to him about faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	And while he was talking about righteousness and self-control and the judging which was to come , Felix had great fear and said , Go away for the present , and when the right time comes I will send for you .
44024026	For he was hoping that Paul would give him money : so he sent for him more frequently and had talk with him .
44024027	But after two years Porcius Festus took the place of Felix , who , desiring to have the approval of the Jews , kept Paul in chains .
44025001	So Festus , having come into that part of the country which was under his rule , after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea .
44025002	And the chief priests and the chief men of the Jews made statements against Paul ,
44025003	Requesting Festus to give effect to their design against him , and send him to Jerusalem , when they would be waiting to put him to death on the way .
44025004	But Festus , in answer , said that Paul was being kept in prison at Caesarea , and that in a short time he himself was going there .
44025005	So , he said , let those who have authority among you go with me , and if there is any wrong in the man , let them make a statement against him .
44025006	And when he had been with them not more than eight or ten days , he went down to Caesarea ; and on the day after , he took his place on the judge's seat , and sent for Paul .
44025007	And when he came , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem came round him , and made all sorts of serious statements against him , which were not supported by the facts .
44025008	Then Paul , in his answer to them , said , I have done no wrong against the law of the Jews , or against the Temple , or against Caesar .
44025009	But Festus , desiring to get the approval of the Jews , said to Paul , Will you go up to Jerusalem , and be judged before me there in connection with these things ?
44025010	And Paul said , I am before the seat of Caesar's authority where it is right for me to be judged : I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you are well able to see .
44025011	If , then , I am a wrongdoer and there is a cause of death in me , I am ready for death : if it is not as they say against me , no man may give me up to them . Let my cause come before Caesar .
44025012	Then Festus , having had a discussion with the Jews , made answer , You have said , Let my cause come before Caesar ; to Caesar you will go .
44025013	Now when some days had gone by , King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea and went to see Festus .
44025014	And as they were there for some days , Festus gave them Paul's story , saying , There is a certain man here who was put in prison by Felix :
44025015	Against whom the chief priests and the rulers of the Jews made a statement when I was at Jerusalem , requesting me to give a decision against him .
44025016	To whom I gave answer that it is not the Roman way to give a man up , till he has been face to face with those who are attacking him , and has had a chance to give an answer to the statements made against him .
44025017	So , when they had come together here , straight away , on the day after , I took my place on the judge's seat and sent for the man .
44025018	But when they got up they said nothing about such crimes as I had in mind :
44025019	But had certain questions against him in connection with their religion , and about one Jesus , now dead , who , Paul said , was living .
44025020	And as I had not enough knowledge for the discussion of these things , I made the suggestion to him to go to Jerusalem and be judged there .
44025021	But when Paul made a request that he might be judged by Caesar , I gave orders for him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar .
44025022	And Agrippa said to Festus , I have a desire to give the man a hearing myself . Tomorrow , he said , you may give him a hearing .
44025023	So on the day after , when Agrippa and Bernice in great glory had come into the public place of hearing , with the chief of the army and the chief men of the town , at the order of Festus , Paul was sent for .
44025024	And Festus said , King Agrippa , and all those who are present here with us , you see this man , about whom all the Jews have made protests to me , at Jerusalem and in this place , saying that it is not right for him to be living any longer .
44025025	But , in my opinion , there is no cause of death in him , and as he himself has made a request to be judged by Caesar , I have said that I would send him .
44025026	But I have no certain account of him to send to Caesar . So I have sent for him to come before you , and specially before you , King Agrippa , so that after the business has been gone into , I may have something to put in writing .
44025027	For it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him .
44026001	And Agrippa said to Paul , You may put your cause before us . Then Paul , stretching out his hand , made his answer , saying :
44026002	In my opinion I am happy , King Agrippa , to be able to give my answer before you today to all these things which the Jews say against me :
44026003	The more so , because you are expert in all questions to do with the Jews and their ways : so I make my request to you to give me a hearing to the end .
44026004	All the Jews have knowledge of my way of life from my early years , as it was from the start among my nation , and at Jerusalem ;
44026005	And they are able to say , if they would give witness , that I was living as a Pharisee , in that division of our religion which is most regular in the keeping of the law .
44026006	And now I am here to be judged because of the hope given by God's word to our fathers ;
44026007	For the effecting of which our twelve tribes have been working and waiting night and day with all their hearts . And in connection with this hope I am attacked by the Jews , O king !
44026008	Why , in your opinion , is it outside belief for God to make the dead come to life again ?
44026009	For I , truly , was of the opinion that it was right for me to do a number of things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
44026010	And this I did in Jerusalem : and numbers of the saints I put in prison , having had authority given to me from the chief priests , and when they were put to death , I gave my decision against them .
44026011	And I gave them punishment frequently , in all the Synagogues , forcing them to say things against God ; and burning with passion against them , I went after them even into far-away towns .
44026012	Then , when I was journeying to Damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests ,
44026013	In the middle of the day , on the road I saw a light from heaven , brighter than the sun , shining round me and those who were journeying with me .
44026014	And when we had all gone down on the earth , a voice came to me , saying in the Hebrew language , Saul , Saul , why are you attacking me so cruelly ? It is hard for you to go against the impulse which is driving you .
44026015	And I said , Who are you , Lord ? And the Lord said , I am Jesus , whom you are attacking .
44026016	But get up on your feet : for I have come to you for this purpose , to make you a servant and a witness of the things in which you have seen me , and of those in which you will see me ;
44026017	And I will keep you safe from the people , and from the Gentiles , to whom I send you ,
44026018	To make their eyes open , turning them from the dark to the light , and from the power of Satan to God , so that they may have forgiveness of sins and a heritage among those who are made holy by faith in me .
44026019	So , then , King Agrippa , I did not go against the vision from heaven ;
44026020	But I went about , first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem , and through all the country of Judaea , and then to the Gentiles , preaching a change of heart , so that they , being turned to God , might give , in their works , the fruits of a changed heart .
44026021	For this reason , the Jews took me in the Temple , and made an attempt to put me to death .
44026022	And so , by God's help , I am here today , witnessing to small and great , saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come about ;
44026023	That the Christ would go through pain , and being the first to come back from the dead , would give light to the people and to the Gentiles .
44026024	And when he made his answer in these words , Festus said in a loud voice , Paul , you are off your head ; your great learning has made you unbalanced .
44026025	Then Paul said , I am not off my head , most noble Festus , but my words are true and wise .
44026026	For the king has knowledge of these things , to whom I am talking freely ; being certain that all this is common knowledge to him ; for it has not been done in secret .
44026027	King Agrippa , have you faith in the prophets ? I am certain that you have .
44026028	And Agrippa said to Paul , A little more and you will be making me a Christian .
44026029	And Paul said , It is my prayer to God that , in little or great measure , not only you , but all those hearing me today might be even as I am , but for these chains .
44026030	And the king and the ruler and Bernice and those who were seated with them got up ;
44026031	And when they had gone away they said to one another , This man has done nothing which might give cause for death or prison .
44026032	And Agrippa said to Festus , This man might have been made free , if he had not put his cause before Caesar .
44027001	And when the decision had been made that we were to go by sea to Italy , they gave Paul and certain other prisoners into the care of a captain named Julius , of the Augustan band .
44027002	And we went to sea in a ship of Adramyttium which was sailing to the sea towns of Asia , Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
44027003	And on the day after , we came to Sidon ; and Julius was kind to Paul , and let him go to see his friends and take a rest .
44027004	And sailing again from there , we went on under cover of Cyprus , because the wind was against us .
44027005	And having gone across the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra , in Lycia .
44027006	And there the captain came across a ship of Alexandria , sailing for Italy , and put us in it .
44027007	And when we had gone on slowly for a long time , and had had hard work getting across to Cnidus , for the wind was against us , we went under cover of Crete , in the direction of Salmone ;
44027008	And sailing down the side of it , as well as we were able , we came to a certain place named Fair Havens , near which was the town of Lasea .
44027009	And as a long time had gone by , and the journey was now full of danger , because it was late in the year , Paul put the position before them ,
44027010	Saying , Friends , I see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss , not only to the goods and the ship , but to ourselves .
44027011	But the captain gave more attention to the master and the owner of the ship than to what Paul said .
44027012	And as the harbour was not a good one in which to be for the winter , the greater number of them were for going out to sea , in order , if possible , to put in for the winter at Phoenix , a harbour of Crete , looking to the north-east and south-east .
44027013	And when the south wind came softly , being of the opinion that their purpose might be effected , they let the ship go and went sailing down the side of Crete , very near to the land .
44027014	But after a little time , a very violent wind , named Euraquilo , came down from it with great force .
44027015	And when the ship got into the grip of it , and was not able to make headway into the wind , we gave way , and went before it .
44027016	And , sailing near the side of a small island named Cauda , we were able , though it was hard work , to make the ship's boat safe :
44027017	And having got it up , they put cords under and round the ship ; but fearing that they might be pushed on to the Syrtis , they let down the sails and so went running before the wind .
44027018	And , still fighting the storm with all our strength , the day after they made a start at getting the goods out of the ship ;
44027019	And on the third day , they let all the sailing apparatus go over the side .
44027020	And as we had not seen the sun or stars for a long time , and a great storm was on us , all hope of salvation was gone .
44027021	And when they had been without food for a long time , Paul got up among them and said , Friends , it would have been better if you had given attention to me and not gone sailing out from Crete , to undergo this damage and loss .
44027022	But now , I say to you , be of good heart , for there will be no loss of life , but only of the ship .
44027023	For this night there came to my side an angel of the God who is my Master and whose servant I am ,
44027024	Saying , Have no fear , Paul , for you will come before Caesar , and God has given to you all those who are sailing with you .
44027025	And so , O men , be of good heart , for I have faith in God that it will be as he said to me .
44027026	But we will be sent on to a certain island .
44027027	But when the fourteenth day came , while we were going here and there in the Adriatic sea , about the middle of the night the sailors had an idea that they were getting near land ;
44027028	And they let down the lead , and saw that the sea was a hundred and twenty feet deep ; and after a little time they did it again and it was ninety feet .
44027029	Then , fearing that by chance we might come on to the rocks , they let down four hooks from the back of the ship , and made prayers for the coming of day .
44027030	Then the sailors made attempts secretly to get away from the ship , letting down a boat as if they were about to put down hooks from the front of the ship ;
44027031	But Paul said to the captain and his men , If you do not keep these men in the ship , you will not be safe .
44027032	Then the armed men , cutting the cords of the boat , let her go .
44027033	And when dawn was near , Paul gave them all orders to take food , saying , This is the fourteenth day you have been waiting and taking no food .
44027034	So I make request to you to take food ; for this is for your salvation : not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction .
44027035	And when he had said this and had taken bread , he gave praise to God before them all , and took a meal of the broken bread .
44027036	Then they all took heart and did the same .
44027037	And we were , in the ship , two hundred and seventy-six persons .
44027038	And when they had had enough food , they made the weight of the ship less , turning the grain out into the sea .
44027039	And when it was day , they had no knowledge of the land , but they saw an inlet of the sea with a floor of sand , and they had the idea of driving the ship up on to it if possible .
44027040	So cutting away the hooks , and letting them go into the sea , and freeing the cords of the guiding-blades , and lifting up the sail to the wind , they went in the direction of the inlet .
44027041	And coming to a point between two seas , they got the ship to land ; and the front part was fixed in the sand and not able to be moved , but the back part was broken by the force of the waves .
44027042	Then the armed men were for putting the prisoners to death , so that no one would get away by swimming .
44027043	But the captain , desiring to keep Paul safe , kept them from their purpose , and gave orders that those who had knowledge of swimming were to go off the ship and get first to land :
44027044	And the rest , some on boards and some on things from the ship . And so it came about that they all got safe to land .
44028001	And when we were safe , we made the discovery that the island was named Melita .
44028002	And the simple people living there were uncommonly kind to us , for they made a fire for us , and took us in , because it was raining and cold .
44028003	But when Paul had got some sticks together and put them on the fire , a snake came out , because of the heat , and gave him a bite on the hand .
44028004	And when the people saw it hanging on his hand , they said to one another , Without doubt this man has put someone to death , and though he has got safely away from the sea , God will not let him go on living .
44028005	But shaking off the beast into the fire , he got no damage .
44028006	But they had the idea that they would see him becoming ill , or suddenly falling down dead ; but after waiting a long time , and seeing that no damage came to him , changing their opinion , they said he was a god .
44028007	Now near that place there was some land , the property of the chief man of the island , who was named Publius ; who very kindly took us into his house as his guests for three days .
44028008	And the father of Publius was ill , with a disease of the stomach ; to whom Paul went , and put his hands on him , with prayer , and made him well .
44028009	And when this took place , all the others in the island who had diseases came and were made well .
44028010	Then they gave us great honour , and , when we went away , they put into the ship whatever things we were in need of .
44028011	And after three months we went to sea in a ship of Alexandria sailing under the sign of the Dioscuri , which had been at the island for the winter .
44028012	And going into the harbour at Syracuse , we were waiting there for three days .
44028013	And from there , going about in a curve , we came to Rhegium : and after one day a south wind came up and on the day after we came to Puteoli :
44028014	Where we came across some of the brothers , who kept us with them for seven days ; and so we came to Rome .
44028015	And the brothers , when they had news of us , came out from town as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us : and Paul , seeing them , gave praise to God and took heart .
44028016	And when we came into Rome , they let Paul have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him .
44028017	Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews : and when they had come together , he said to them , My brothers , though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers , I was given , a prisoner from Jerusalem , into the hands of the Romans .
44028018	Who , when they had put questions to me , were ready to let me go free , because there was no cause of death in me .
44028019	But when the Jews made protest against it , I had to put my cause into Caesar's hands ; not because I have anything to say against my nation .
44028020	But for this reason I sent for you , to see and have talk with you : for because of the hope of Israel I am in these chains .
44028021	And they said to him , We have not had letters from Judaea about you , and no one of the brothers has come to us here to give an account or say any evil about you .
44028022	But we have a desire to give hearing to your opinion : for as to this form of religion , we have knowledge that in all places it is attacked .
44028023	And when a day had been fixed , they came to his house in great numbers ; and he gave them teaching , giving witness to the kingdom of God , and having discussions with them about Jesus , from the law of Moses and from the prophets , from morning till evening .
44028024	And some were in agreement with what he said , but some had doubts .
44028025	And they went away , for there was a division among them after Paul had said this one thing : Well did the Holy Spirit say by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers ,
44028026	Go to this people and say , Though you give ear , you will not get knowledge ; and seeing , you will see , but the sense will not be clear to you :
44028027	For the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut ; for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me , so that I might make them well .
44028028	Be certain , then , that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles , and they will give hearing .
44028030	And for the space of two years , Paul was living in the house of which he had the use , and had talk with all those who went in to see him ,
44028031	Preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ without fear , and no orders were given that he was not to do so .
45001001	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , an Apostle by the selection of God , given authority as a preacher of the good news ,
45001002	Of which God had given word before by his prophets in the holy Writings ,
45001003	About his Son who , in the flesh , came from the family of David ,
45001004	But was marked out as Son of God in power by the Holy Spirit through the coming to life again of the dead ; Jesus Christ our Lord ,
45001005	Through whom grace has been given to us , sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations , for his name :
45001006	Among whom you in the same way have been marked out to be disciples of Jesus Christ :
45001007	To all those who are in Rome , loved by God , marked out as saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First of all , I give praise to my God through Jesus Christ for you all , because news of your faith has gone into all the world .
45001009	For God is my witness , whose servant I am in spirit in the good news of his Son , that you are at all times in my memory and in my prayers ,
45001010	And that I am ever making prayers that God will give me a good journey to you .
45001011	For I have a strong desire to see you , and to give you some grace of the spirit , so that you may be made strong ;
45001012	That is to say , that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me .
45001013	You may be certain , my brothers , that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you ( but till now I was kept from it ) , so that I might have some fruit from you in the same way as I have had it from the other nations .
45001014	I have a debt to Greeks and to the nations outside ; to the wise and to those who have no learning .
45001015	For which reason I have the desire , as far as I am able , to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in Rome .
45001016	For I have no feeling of shame about the good news , because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone who has faith , to the Jew first , and then to the Greek .
45001017	For in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of God from faith to faith : as it is said in the holy Writings , The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith .
45001018	For there is a revelation of the wrath of God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing ;
45001019	Because the knowledge of God may be seen in them , God having made it clear to them .
45001020	For from the first making of the world , those things of God which the eye is unable to see , that is , his eternal power and existence , are fully made clear , he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made , so that men have no reason for wrongdoing :
45001021	Because , having the knowledge of God , they did not give glory to God as God , and did not give praise , but their minds were full of foolish things , and their hearts , being without sense , were made dark .
45001022	Seeming to be wise , they were in fact foolish ,
45001023	And by them the glory of the eternal God was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal , and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth .
45001024	For this reason God gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts , working shame in their bodies with one another :
45001025	Because by them the true word of God was changed into that which is false , and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made , and not to him who made it , to whom be blessing for ever . So be it .
45001026	For this reason God gave them up to evil passions , and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural :
45001027	And in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another , men doing shame with men , and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil-doing .
45001028	And because they had not the mind to keep God in their knowledge , God gave them up to an evil mind , to do those things which are not right ;
45001029	Being full of all wrongdoing , evil , desire for the goods of others , hate , envy , putting to death , fighting , deceit , cruel ways , evil talk , and false statements about others ;
45001030	Hated by God , full of pride , without respect , full of loud talk , given to evil inventions , not honouring father or mother ,
45001031	Without knowledge , not true to their undertakings , unkind , having no mercy :
45001032	Who , though they have knowledge of the law of God , that the fate of those who do these things is death , not only go on doing these things themselves , but give approval to those who do them .
45002001	So you have no reason , whoever you are , for judging : for in judging another you are judging yourself , for you do the same things .
45002002	And we are conscious that God is a true judge against those who do such things .
45002003	But you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself , are you hoping that God's decision will not take effect against you ?
45002004	Or is it nothing to you that God had pity on you , waiting and putting up with you for so long , not seeing that in his pity God's desire is to give you a change of heart ?
45002005	But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's judging in righteousness ;
45002006	Who will give to every man his right reward :
45002007	To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death , he will give eternal life :
45002008	But to those who , from a love of competition , are not guided by what is true , will come the heat of his wrath ,
45002009	Trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil , to the Jew first and then to the Greek ;
45002010	But glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good , to the Jew first and then to the Greek :
45002011	For one man is not different from another before God .
45002012	All those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law : and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law ;
45002013	For it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before God , but only the doers :
45002014	For when the Gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law , they are a law to themselves ;
45002015	Because the work of the law is seen in their hearts , their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it , while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval ;
45002016	In the day when God will be a judge of the secrets of men , as it says in the good news of which I am a preacher , through Jesus Christ .
45002017	But as for you who have the name of Jew , and are resting on the law , and take pride in God ,
45002018	And have knowledge of his desires , and are a judge of the things which are different , having the learning of the law ,
45002019	In the belief that you are a guide to the blind , a light to those in the dark ,
45002020	A teacher of the foolish , having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true ;
45002021	You who give teaching to others , do you give it to yourself ? you who say that a man may not take what is not his , do you take what is not yours ?
45002022	You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife , are you true to yours ? you who are a hater of images , do you do wrong to the house of God ?
45002023	You who take pride in the law , are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law ?
45002024	For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you , as it is said in the holy Writings .
45002025	It is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law , but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not .
45002026	If those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law , will it not be credited to them as circumcision ?
45002027	And they , by their keeping of the law without circumcision , will be judges of you , by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision .
45002028	The true Jew is not one who is only so publicly , and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh :
45002029	But he is a Jew who is a secret one , whose circumcision is of the heart , in the spirit and not in the letter ; whose praise is not from men , but from God .
45003001	How then is the Jew better off ? or what profit is there in circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way : first of all because the words of God were given to them .
45003003	And if some have no faith , will that make the faith of God without effect ?
45003004	In no way : but let God be true , though every man is seen to be untrue ; as it is said in the Writings , That your words may be seen to be true , and you may be seen to be right when you are judged .
45003005	But if the righteousness of God is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said ? is it wrong for God to be angry ( as men may say ) ?
45003006	In no way : because if it is so , how is God able to be the judge of all the world ?
45003007	But if , because I am untrue , God being seen to be true gets more glory , why am I to be judged as a sinner ?
45003008	Let us not do evil so that good may come ( a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made ) , because such behaviour will have its right punishment .
45003009	What then ? are we worse off than they ? In no way : because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin ;
45003010	As it is said in the holy Writings , There is not one who does righteousness ;
45003011	Not one who has the knowledge of what is right , not one who is a searcher after God ;
45003012	They have all gone out of the way , there is no profit in any of them ; there is not one who does good , not so much as one :
45003013	Their throat is like an open place of death ; with their tongues they have said what is not true : the poison of snakes is under their lips :
45003014	Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words :
45003015	Their feet are quick in running after blood ;
45003016	Destruction and trouble are in their ways ;
45003017	And of the way of peace they have no knowledge :
45003018	There is no fear of God before their eyes .
45003019	Now , we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be stopped , and all men may be judged by God :
45003020	Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes , for through the law comes the knowledge of sin .
45003021	But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God , to which witness is given by the law and the prophets ;
45003022	That is , the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ , to all those who have faith ; and one man is not different from another ,
45003023	For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God ;
45003024	And they may have righteousness put to their credit , freely , by his grace , through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus :
45003025	Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy , through faith , by his blood , to make clear his righteousness when , in his pity , God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment ;
45003026	And to make clear his righteousness now , so that he might himself be upright , and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus .
45003027	What reason , then , is there for pride ? It is shut out . By what sort of law ? of works ? No , but by a law of faith .
45003028	For this reason , then , a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law .
45003029	Or is God the God of Jews only ? is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles ? Yes , of Gentiles :
45003030	If God is one ; and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision , and through faith to those who have not circumcision .
45003031	Do we , then , through faith make the law of no effect ? in no way : but we make it clear that the law is important .
45004001	What , then , may we say that Abraham , our father after the flesh , has got ?
45004002	For if Abraham got righteousness by works , he has reason for pride ; but not before God .
45004003	But what does it say in the holy Writings ? And Abraham had faith in God , and it was put to his account as righteousness .
45004004	Now , the reward is credited to him who does works , not as of grace but as a debt .
45004005	But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer , his faith is put to his account as righteousness .
45004006	As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works , saying ,
45004007	Happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing , and whose sins are covered .
45004008	Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord .
45004009	Is this blessing , then , for the circumcision only , or in the same way for those who have not circumcision ? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness .
45004010	How , then , was it judged ? when he had circumcision , or when he had it not ? Not when he had it , but when he did not have it :
45004011	And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision : so that he might be the father of all those who have faith , though they have not circumcision , and so that righteousness might be put to their account ;
45004012	And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision , but who keep to the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision .
45004013	For God's word , that the earth would be his heritage , was given to Abraham , not through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
45004014	For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage , then faith is made of no use , and the word of God has no power ;
45004015	For the outcome of the law is wrath ; but where there is no law it will not be broken .
45004016	For this reason it is of faith , so that it may be through grace ; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed ; not only to that which is of the law , but to that which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all ,
45004017	( As it is said in the holy Writings , I have made you a father of a number of nations ) before him in whom he had faith , that is , God , who gives life to the dead , and to whom the things which are not are as if they were .
45004018	Who without reason for hope , in faith went on hoping , so that he became the father of a number of nations , as it had been said , So will your seed be .
45004019	And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead ( he being about a hundred years old ) and Sarah was no longer able to have children :
45004020	Still , he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God , but was made strong by faith , giving glory to God ,
45004021	And being certain that God was able to keep his word .
45004022	For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness .
45004023	Now , it was not because of him only that this was said ,
45004024	But for us in addition , to whose account it will be put , if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead ,
45004025	Who was put to death for our evil-doing , and came to life again so that we might have righteousness .
45005001	For which reason , because we have righteousness through faith , let us be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ;
45005002	Through whom , in the same way , we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are ; and let us have joy in hope of the glory of God .
45005003	And not only so , but let us have joy in our troubles : in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting ;
45005004	And waiting gives experience ; and experience , hope :
45005005	And hope does not put to shame ; because our hearts are full of the love of God through the Holy Spirit which is given to us .
45005006	For when we were still without strength , at the right time Christ gave his life for evil-doers .
45005007	Now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man , though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life .
45005008	But God has made clear his love to us , in that , when we were still sinners , Christ gave his life for us .
45005009	Much more , if we now have righteousness by his blood , will salvation from the wrath of God come to us through him .
45005010	For if , when we were haters of God , the death of his Son made us at peace with him , much more , now that we are his friends , will we have salvation through his life ;
45005011	And not only so , but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we are now at peace with God .
45005012	For this reason , as through one man sin came into the world , and death because of sin , and so death came to all men , because all have done evil :
45005013	Because , till the law came , sin was in existence , but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken .
45005014	But still death had power from Adam till Moses , even over those who had not done wrong like Adam , who is a picture of him who was to come .
45005015	But the free giving of God is not like the wrongdoing of man . For if , by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men , much more did the grace of God , and the free giving by the grace of one man , Jesus Christ , come to men .
45005016	And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one : for the effect of one man's sin was punishment by the decision of God , but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number .
45005017	For , if by the wrongdoing of one , death was ruling through the one , much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness , be ruling in life through the one , even Jesus Christ .
45005018	So then , as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men , even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men .
45005019	Because , as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man , even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man .
45005020	And the law came in addition , to make wrongdoing worse ; but where there was much sin , there was much more grace :
45005021	That , as sin had power in death , so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	What may we say , then ? are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace ?
45006002	In no way . How may we , who are dead to sin , be living in it any longer ?
45006003	Or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into Christ Jesus , had baptism into his death ?
45006004	We have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death : so that as Christ came again from the dead by the glory of the Father , we , in the same way , might be living in new life .
45006005	For , if we have been made like him in his death , we will , in the same way , be like him in his coming to life again ;
45006006	Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him , so that the body of sin might be put away , and we might no longer be servants to sin .
45006007	Because he who is dead is free from sin .
45006008	But if we are dead with Christ , we have faith that we will be living with him ;
45006009	Having knowledge that because Christ has come back from the dead , he will never again go down to the dead ; death has no more power over him .
45006010	For his death was a death to sin , but his life now is a life which he is living to God .
45006011	Even so see yourselves as dead to sin , but living to God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	For this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death , so that you give way to its desires ;
45006013	And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing , but give yourselves to God , as those who are living from the dead , and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God .
45006014	For sin may not have rule over you : because you are not under law , but under grace .
45006015	What then ? are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace ? Let it not be so .
45006016	Are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire ? if to sin , the end being death , or if to do the desire of God , the end being righteousness .
45006017	But praise be to God that though you were the servants of sin , you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed ;
45006018	And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness .
45006019	I am using words in the way of men , because your flesh is feeble : as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean , and to evil to do evil , so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy .
45006020	When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness .
45006021	What fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you ? for the end of such things is death .
45006022	But now , being free from sin , and having been made servants to God , you have your fruit in that which is holy , and the end is eternal life .
45006023	For the reward of sin is death ; but what God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord .
45007001	Is it not clear , my brothers ( I am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law ) , that the law has power over a man as long as he is living ?
45007002	For the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living ; but if her husband is dead , she is free from the law of the husband .
45007003	So if , while the husband is living , she is joined to another man , she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband : but if the husband is dead , she is free from the law , so that she is not untrue , even if she takes another man .
45007004	In the same way , my brothers , you were made dead to the law through the body of Christ , so that you might be joined to another , even to him who came again from the dead , so that we might give fruit to God .
45007005	For when we were in the flesh , the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death .
45007006	But now we are free from the law , having been made dead to that which had power over us ; so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit , not in the old way of the letter .
45007007	What then is to be said ? is the law sin ? in no way . But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law : for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said , You may not have a desire for what is another's .
45007008	But sin , taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law , was working in me every form of desire : because without the law sin is dead .
45007009	And there was a time when I was living without the law : but when the law gave its orders , sin came to life and put me to death ;
45007010	And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death :
45007011	For I was tricked and put to death by sin , which took its chance through the law .
45007012	But the law is holy , and its orders are holy , upright , and good .
45007013	Was then that which is good , death to me ? In no way . But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good ; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil .
45007014	For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit ; but I am of the flesh , given into the power of sin .
45007015	And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing , for that which I have a mind to do , I do not , but what I have hate for , that I do .
45007016	But , if I do that which I have no mind to do , I am in agreement with the law that the law is good .
45007017	So it is no longer I who do it , but the sin living in me .
45007018	For I am conscious that in me , that is , in my flesh , there is nothing good : I have the mind but not the power to do what is right .
45007019	For the good which I have a mind to do , I do not : but the evil which I have no mind to do , that I do .
45007020	But if I do what I have no mind to do , it is no longer I who do it , but the sin living in me .
45007021	So I see a law that , though I have a mind to do good , evil is present in me .
45007022	In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God ,
45007023	But I see another law in my body , working against the law of my mind , and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh .
45007024	How unhappy am I ! who will make me free from the body of this death ?
45007025	I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord . So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God , but with my flesh to the law of sin .
45008001	For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners .
45008002	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death .
45008003	For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh , God , sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh , and as an offering for sin , gave his decision against sin in the flesh :
45008004	So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us , who are living , not in the way of the flesh , but in the way of the Spirit .
45008005	For those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh , but those who go in the way of the Spirit , to the things of the Spirit .
45008006	For the mind of the flesh is death , but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace :
45008007	Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God ; it is not under the law of God , and is not able to be :
45008008	So that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to God .
45008009	You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if the Spirit of God is in you . But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his .
45008010	And if Christ is in you , the body is dead because of sin , but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
45008011	But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you , he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way , through his Spirit which is in you , give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death .
45008012	So then , my brothers , we are in debt , not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh :
45008013	For if you go in the way of the flesh , death will come on you ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body , you will have life .
45008014	And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God .
45008015	For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear , but the spirit of sons was given to you , by which we say , Abba , Father .
45008016	The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God :
45008017	And if we are children , we have a right to a part in the heritage ; a part in the things of God , together with Christ ; so that if we have a part in his pain , we will in the same way have a part in his glory .
45008018	I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future .
45008019	For the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God .
45008020	For every living thing was put under the power of change , not by its desire , but by him who made it so , in hope
45008021	That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory .
45008022	For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now .
45008023	And not only so , but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we have sorrow in our minds , waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons , that is , the salvation of our bodies .
45008024	For our salvation is by hope : but hope which is seen is not hope : for who is hoping for what he sees ?
45008025	But if we have hope for that which we see not , then we will be able to go on waiting for it .
45008026	And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts : for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way ; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say ;
45008027	And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit , because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God .
45008028	And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God , and have been marked out by his purpose .
45008029	Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence , were marked out by him to be made like his Son , so that he might be the first among a band of brothers :
45008030	And those who were marked out by him were named ; and those who were named were given righteousness ; and to those to whom he gave righteousness , in the same way he gave glory .
45008031	What may we say about these things ? If God is for us , who is against us ?
45008032	He who did not keep back his only Son , but gave him up for us all , will he not with him freely give us all things ?
45008033	Who will say anything against the saints of God ? It is God who makes us clear from evil ;
45008034	Who will give a decision against us ? It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death , but came again from the dead , who is now at the right hand of God , taking our part .
45008035	Who will come between us and the love of Christ ? Will trouble , or pain , or cruel acts , or the need of food or of clothing , or danger , or the sword ?
45008036	As it is said in the holy Writings , Because of you we are put to death every day ; we are like sheep ready for destruction .
45008037	But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love .
45008038	For I am certain that not death , or life , or angels , or rulers , or things present , or things to come , or powers ,
45008039	Or things on high , or things under the earth , or anything which is made , will be able to come between us and the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I say what is true in Christ , and not what is false , my mind giving witness with me in the Holy Spirit ,
45009002	That I am full of sorrow and pain without end .
45009003	For I have a desire to take on myself the curse for my brothers , my family in the flesh :
45009004	Who are Israelites : who have the place of sons , and the glory , and the agreements with God , and the giving of the law , and the worship , and the hope offered by God :
45009005	Whose are the fathers , and of whom came Christ in the flesh , who is over all , God , to whom be blessing for ever . So be it .
45009006	But it is not as if the word of God was without effect . For they are not all Israel , who are of Israel :
45009007	And they are not all children because they are the seed of Abraham ; but , In Isaac will your seed be named .
45009008	That is , it is not the children of the flesh , but the children of God's undertaking , who are named as the seed .
45009009	For this is the word of God's undertaking , At this time will I come , and Sarah will have a son .
45009010	And not only so , but Rebecca being about to have a child by our father Isaac - -
45009011	Before the children had come into existence , or had done anything good or bad , in order that God's purpose and his selection might be effected , not by works , but by him whose purpose it is ,
45009012	It was said to her , The older will be the servant of the younger .
45009013	Even as it is said , I had love for Jacob , but for Esau I had hate .
45009014	What may we say then ? is God not upright ? let it not be said .
45009015	For he says to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and pity on whom I will have pity .
45009016	So then , it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man , but by the mercy of God .
45009017	For the holy Writings say to Pharaoh , For this same purpose did I put you on high , so that I might make my power seen in you , and that there might be knowledge of my name through all the earth .
45009018	So then , at his pleasure he has mercy on a man , and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard .
45009019	But you will say to me , Why does he still make us responsible ? who is able to go against his purpose ?
45009020	But , O man , who are you , to make answer against God ? May the thing which is made say to him who made it , Why did you make me so ?
45009021	Or has not the potter the right to make out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour , and out of another a vessel for shame ?
45009022	What if God , desiring to let his wrath and his power be seen , for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath which were ready for destruction :
45009023	And to make clear the wealth of his glory to vessels of mercy , which he had before made ready for glory ,
45009024	Even us , who were marked out by him , not only from the Jews , but from the Gentiles ?
45009025	As he says in Hosea , They will be named my people who were not my people , and she will be loved who was not loved .
45009026	And in the place where it was said to them , You are not my people , there they will be named the sons of the living God .
45009027	And Isaiah says about Israel , Even if the number of the children of Israel is as the sand of the sea , only a small part will get salvation :
45009028	For the Lord will give effect to his word on the earth , putting an end to it and cutting it short .
45009029	And , as Isaiah had said before , If the Lord of armies had not given us a seed , we would have been like Sodom and Gomorrah .
45009030	What then may we say ? That the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith :
45009031	But Israel , going after a law of righteousness , did not get it .
45009032	Why ? Because they were not searching for it by faith , but by works . They came up against the stone which was in the way ;
45009033	As it is said , See , I am putting in Zion a stone causing a fall , and a rock in the way : but he who has faith in him will not be put to shame .
45010001	Brothers , my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is , that they may get salvation .
45010002	For I give witness of them that they have a strong desire for God , but not with knowledge .
45010003	Because , not having knowledge of God's righteousness , and desiring to give effect to their righteousness , they have not put themselves under the righteousness of God .
45010004	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith .
45010005	For Moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it .
45010006	But the righteousness which is of faith says these words , Say not in your heart , Who will go up to heaven ? ( that is , to make Christ come down : )
45010007	Or , Who will go down into the deep ? ( that is , to make Christ come again from the dead : )
45010008	But what does it say ? The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart : that is , the word of faith of which we are the preachers :
45010009	Because , if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead , you will have salvation :
45010010	For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness , and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation .
45010011	Because it is said in the holy Writings , Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed .
45010012	And the Jew is not different from the Greek : for there is the same Lord of all , who is good to all who have hope in his name :
45010013	Because , Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation .
45010014	But how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith ? and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news ? and how will they have news without a preacher ?
45010015	And how will there be preachers if they are not sent ? As it is said , How beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things .
45010016	But they have not all given ear to the good news . For Isaiah says , Lord , who has had faith in our word ?
45010017	So faith comes by hearing , and hearing by the word of Christ .
45010018	But I say , Did not the word come to their ears ? Yes , certainly : Their sound has gone out into all the earth , and their words to the ends of the world .
45010019	But I say , Had Israel no knowledge ? First Moses says , You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation , and by a foolish people I will make you angry .
45010020	And Isaiah says without fear , Those who were not searching for me made discovery of me ; and I was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me .
45010021	But about Israel he says ; All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away , and who put themselves against my word .
45011001	So I say , Has God put his people on one side ? Let there be no such thought . For I am of Israel , of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God has not put away the people of his selection . Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the holy Writings ? how he says words to God against Israel ,
45011003	Lord , they have put your prophets to death , and made waste your altars , and now I am the last , and they are searching for me to take away my life .
45011004	But what answer does God make to him ? I have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal .
45011005	In the same way , there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace .
45011006	But if it is of grace , then it is no longer of works : or grace would not be grace .
45011007	What then ? That which Israel was searching for he did not get , but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard .
45011008	As it was said in the holy Writings , God gave them a spirit of sleep , eyes which might not see , and ears which have no hearing , to this day .
45011009	And David says , Let their table be made a net for taking them , and a stone in their way , and a punishment :
45011010	Let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see , and let their back be bent down at all times .
45011011	So I say , Were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall ? In no way : but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles , so that they might be moved to envy .
45011012	Now , if their fall is the wealth of the world , and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles , how much greater will be the glory when they are made full ?
45011013	But I say to you , Gentiles , in so far as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles , I make much of my position :
45011014	If in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy , so that some of them may get salvation by me .
45011015	For , if by their putting away , the rest of men have been made friends with God , what will their coming back again be , but life from the dead ?
45011016	And if the first-fruit is holy , so is the mass : and if the root is holy , so are the branches .
45011017	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you , an olive-tree of the fields , were put in among them , and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made fertile ,
45011018	Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches : because it is not you who are the support of the root , but it is by the root that you are supported .
45011019	You will say , Branches were broken off so that I might be put in .
45011020	Truly , because they had no faith they were broken off , and you have your place by reason of your faith . Do not be lifted up in pride , but have fear ;
45011021	For , if God did not have mercy on the natural branches , he will not have mercy on you .
45011022	See then that God is good but his rules are fixed : to those who were put away he was hard , but to you he has been good , on the condition that you keep in his mercy ; if not , you will be cut off as they were .
45011023	And they , if they do not go on without faith , will be united to the tree again , because God is able to put them in again .
45011024	For if you were cut out of a field olive-tree , and against the natural use were united to a good olive-tree , how much more will these , the natural branches , be united again with the olive-tree which was theirs ?
45011025	For it is my desire , brothers , that this secret may be clear to you , so that you may not have pride in your knowledge , that Israel has been made hard in part , till all the Gentiles have come in ;
45011026	And so all Israel will get salvation : as it is said in the holy Writings , There will come out of Zion the One who makes free ; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob :
45011027	And this is my agreement with them , when I will take away their sins .
45011028	As far as the good news is in question , they are cut off from God on account of you , but as far as the selection is in question , they are loved on account of the fathers .
45011029	Because God's selection and his mercies may not be changed .
45011030	For as you , in time past , were not under the rule of God , but now have got mercy through their turning away ,
45011031	So in the same way these have gone against the orders of God , so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy .
45011032	For God has let them all go against his orders , so that he might have mercy on them all .
45011033	O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! no one is able to make discovery of his decisions , and his ways may not be searched out .
45011034	Who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord ? or who has taken part in his purposes ?
45011035	Or who has first given to him , and it will be given back to him again ?
45011036	For of him , and through him , and to him , are all things . To him be the glory for ever . So be it .
45012001	For this reason I make request to you , brothers , by the mercies of God , that you will give your bodies as a living offering , holy , pleasing to God , which is the worship it is right for you to give him .
45012002	And let not your behaviour be like that of this world , but be changed and made new in mind , so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God .
45012003	But I say to every one of you , through the grace given to me , not to have an over-high opinion of himself , but to have wise thoughts , as God has given to every one a measure of faith .
45012004	For , as we have a number of parts in one body , but all the parts have not the same use ,
45012005	So we , though we are a number of persons , are one body in Christ , and are dependent on one another ;
45012006	And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us , such as the quality of a prophet , let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith ;
45012007	Or the position of a Deacon of the church , let a man give himself to it ; or he who has the power of teaching , let him make use of it ;
45012008	He who has the power of comforting , let him do so ; he who gives , let him give freely ; he who has the power of ruling , let him do it with a serious mind ; he who has mercy on others , let it be with joy .
45012009	Let love be without deceit . Be haters of what is evil ; keep your minds fixed on what is good .
45012010	Be kind to one another with a brother's love , putting others before yourselves in honour ;
45012011	Be not slow in your work , but be quick in spirit , as the Lord's servants ;
45012012	Being glad in hope , quiet in trouble , at all times given to prayer ,
45012013	Giving to the needs of the saints , ready to take people into your houses .
45012014	Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you .
45012015	Take part in the joy of those who are glad , and in the grief of those who are sorrowing .
45012016	Be in harmony with one another . Do not have a high opinion of yourselves , but be in agreement with common people . Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom .
45012017	Do not give evil for evil to any man . Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men .
45012018	As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men .
45012019	Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you , dear brothers , but give way to the wrath of God ; for it is said in the holy Writings , Punishment is mine , I will give reward , says the Lord .
45012020	But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink , give it to him , for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head .
45012021	Do not let evil overcome you , but overcome evil by good .
45013001	Let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers , because there is no power which is not of God , and all powers are ordered by God .
45013002	For which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of God : and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves .
45013003	For rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil . If you would have no fear of the authority , do good and you will have praise ;
45013004	For he is the servant of God to you for good . But if you do evil , have fear ; for the sword is not in his hand for nothing : he is God's servant , making God's punishment come on the evil-doer .
45013005	So put yourselves under the authority , not for fear of wrath , but because you have the knowledge of what is right .
45013006	For the same reason , make payment of taxes ; because the authority is God's servant , to take care of such things at all times .
45013007	Give to all what is their right : taxes to him whose they are , payment to him whose right it is , fear to whom fear , honour to whom honour is to be given .
45013008	Be in debt for nothing , but to have love for one another : for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law .
45013009	And this , Do not be untrue in married life , Do not put to death , Do not take what is another's , Do not have desire for what is another's , and if there is any other order , it is covered by this word , Have love for your neighbour as for yourself .
45013010	Love does no wrong to his neighbour , so love makes the law complete .
45013011	See then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep : for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith .
45013012	The night is far gone , and the day is near : so let us put off the works of the dark , arming ourselves with light ,
45013013	With right behaviour as in the day ; not in pleasure-making and drinking , not in bad company and unclean behaviour , not in fighting and envy .
45013014	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires .
45014001	Do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith , and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings .
45014002	One man has faith to take all things as food : another who is feeble in faith takes only green food .
45014003	Let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not : and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does ; for he has God's approval .
45014004	Who are you to make yourself a judge of another man's servant ? it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad . Yes , his place will be safe , because the Lord is able to keep him from falling .
45014005	This man puts one day before another : to that man they are the same . Let every man be certain in his mind .
45014006	He who keeps the day , keeps it to the Lord ; and he who takes food , takes it as to the Lord , for he gives praise to God ; and he who does not take food , to the Lord he takes it not , and gives praise to God .
45014007	For every man's life and every man's death has a relation to others as well as to himself .
45014008	As long as we have life we are living to the Lord ; or if we give up our life it is to the Lord ; so if we are living , or if our life comes to an end , we are the Lord's .
45014009	And for this purpose Christ went into death and came back again , that he might be the Lord of the dead and of the living .
45014010	But you , why do you make yourself your brother's judge ? or again , why have you no respect for your brother ? because we will all have to take our place before God as our judge .
45014011	For it is said in the holy Writings , By my life , says the Lord , to me every knee will be bent , and every tongue will give worship to God .
45014012	So every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God .
45014013	Then let us not be judges of one another any longer : but keep this in mind , that no man is to make it hard for his brother , or give him cause for doubting .
45014014	I am conscious of this , and am certain in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean in itself ; but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean , for him it is unclean .
45014015	And if because of food your brother is troubled , then you are no longer going on in the way of love . Do not let your food be destruction to him for whom Christ went into death .
45014016	Let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good :
45014017	For the kingdom of God is not food and drink , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
45014018	And he who in these things is Christ's servant , is pleasing to God and has the approval of men .
45014019	So then , let us go after the things which make peace , and the things by which we may be a help to one another .
45014020	Do not let the work of God come to nothing on account of food . All things are certainly clean ; but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another .
45014021	It is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother .
45014022	The faith which you have , have it to yourself before God . Happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval .
45014023	But he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food , because he does it not in faith ; and whatever is not of faith is sin .
45015001	We who are strong have to be a support to the feeble , and not give pleasure to ourselves .
45015002	Let every one of us give pleasure to his neighbour for his good , to make him strong .
45015003	For Christ did not give pleasure to himself , but , as it is said , The bitter words of those who were angry with you came on me .
45015004	Now those things which were put down in writing before our time were for our learning , so that through quiet waiting and through the comfort of the holy Writings we might have hope .
45015005	Now may the God who gives comfort and strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in harmony with Christ Jesus :
45015006	So that with one mouth you may give glory to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	So then , take one another to your hearts , as Christ took us , to the glory of God .
45015008	Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by God to the fathers ,
45015009	And so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercy ; as it is said , For this reason I will give praise to you among the Gentiles , and I will make a song to your name .
45015010	And again he says , Take part , you Gentiles , in the joy of his people .
45015011	And again , Give praise to the Lord , all you Gentiles ; and let all the nations give praise to him .
45015012	And again Isaiah says , There will be the root of Jesse , and he who comes to be the ruler over the Gentiles ; in him will the Gentiles put their hope .
45015013	Now may the God of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith , so that all hope may be yours in the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	And I myself am certain of you , brothers , that you are full of what is good , complete in all knowledge , able to give direction to one another .
45015015	But I have , in some measure , less fear in writing to you to put these things before you again , because of the grace which was given to me by God ,
45015016	To be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles , doing the work of a priest in the good news of God , so that the offering of the Gentiles might be pleasing to God , being made holy by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	So I have pride in Christ Jesus in the things which are God's .
45015018	And I will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which Christ has done by me to put the Gentiles under his rule in word and in act ,
45015019	By signs and wonders , in the power of the Holy Spirit ; so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have given all the good news of Christ ;
45015020	Making it my purpose not to take the good news where Christ was named , so that my work might not be resting on that of others ;
45015021	But as it is said in the holy Writings , They will see , to whom the news of him had not been given , and those to whose ears it had not come will have knowledge .
45015022	For which reason I was frequently kept from coming to you :
45015023	But now , having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you ,
45015024	Whenever I go to Spain ( for it is my hope to see you on my way , and to be sent on there by you , if first I may in some measure have been comforted by your company ) - -
45015025	But now I go to Jerusalem , taking help for the saints .
45015026	For it has been the good pleasure of those of Macedonia and Achaia to send a certain amount of money for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem .
45015027	Yes , it has been their good pleasure ; and they are in their debt . For if the Gentiles have had a part in the things of the Spirit which were theirs , it is right for them , in the same way , to give them help in the things of the flesh .
45015028	So when I have done this , and have given them this fruit of love , I will go on by you into Spain .
45015029	And I am certain that when I come , I will be full of the blessing of Christ .
45015030	Now I make request to you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you will be working together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
45015031	So that I may be kept safe from those in Judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of God , and that the help which I am taking for Jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints ;
45015032	So that I may come to you in joy by the good pleasure of God , and have rest with you .
45015033	Now may the God of peace be with you all . So be it .
45016001	It is my desire to say a good word for Phoebe , who is a servant of the church in Cenchreae :
45016002	That you will take her in kindly , after the way of the saints , as one who is the Lord's , and give her help in anything in which she may have need of you : because she has been a help to a great number and to myself .
45016003	Give my love to Prisca and Aquila , workers with me in Christ Jesus ,
45016004	Who for my life put their necks in danger ; to whom not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are in debt :
45016005	And say a kind word to the church which is in their house . Give my love to my dear Epaenetus , who is the first fruit of Asia to Christ .
45016006	Give my love to Mary , who gave much care to you .
45016007	Give my love to Andronicus and Junia , my relations , who were in prison with me , who are noted among the Apostles , and who were in Christ before me .
45016008	Give my love to Ampliatus , who is dear to me in the Lord ,
45016009	Give my love to Urbanus , a worker in Christ with us , and to my dear Stachys .
45016010	Give my love to Apelles , who has the approval of Christ . Say a kind word to those who are of the house of Aristobulus .
45016011	Give my love to Herodion , my relation . Say a kind word to those of the house of Narcissus , who are in the Lord .
45016012	Give my love to Tryphaena and Tryphosa , workers in the Lord . Give my love to my dear Persis , who did much work in the Lord .
45016013	Give my love to Rufus , one of the Lord's selection , and to his mother and mine .
45016014	Give my love to Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brothers who are with them .
45016015	Give my love to Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
45016016	Give one another a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ send their love to you .
45016017	Now , it is my desire , brothers , that you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among you , quite against the teaching which was given to you : and keep away from them .
45016018	For such people are not servants of the Lord Christ , but of their stomachs ; and by their smooth and well-said words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked .
45016019	For all have knowledge of how you do what you are ordered . For this reason I have joy in you , but it is my desire that you may be wise in what is good , and without knowledge of evil .
45016020	And the God of peace will be crushing Satan under your feet before long . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
45016021	Timothy , who is working with me , sends his love to you , so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my relations .
45016022	I , Tertius , who have done the writing of this letter , send love in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , with whom I am living , whose house is open to all the church , sends his love , so does Erastus , the manager of the accounts of the town , and Quartus , the brother .
45016025	Now to him who is able to make you strong in agreement with the good news which I gave you and the preaching of Jesus Christ , in the light of the revelation of that secret which has been kept through times eternal ,
45016026	But is now made clear ; and by the writings of the prophets , by the order of the eternal God , the knowledge of it has been given to all the nations , so that they may come under the rule of the faith ;
45016027	To the only wise God , through Jesus Christ , be the glory for ever . So be it .
46001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God , and Sosthenes the brother ,
46001002	To the church of God which is in Corinth , to those who have been made holy in Christ Jesus , saints by the selection of God , with all those who in every place give honour to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours :
46001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I give praise to my God for you at all times , because of the grace of God which has been given to you in Christ Jesus ;
46001005	So that in him you have wealth in all things , in word and in knowledge of every sort ;
46001006	Even as the witness of the Christ has been made certain among you :
46001007	So that having every grace you are living in the hope of the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
46001008	Who will give you strength to the end , to be free from all sin in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is true , through whom you have been given a part with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	Now I make request to you , my brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you will all say the same thing , and that there may be no divisions among you , so that you may be in complete agreement , in the same mind and in the same opinion .
46001011	Because it has come to my knowledge , through those of the house of Chloe , that there are divisions among you , my brothers .
46001012	That is , that some of you say , I am of Paul ; some say , I am of Apollos ; some say , I am of Cephas ; and some say , I am Christ's .
46001013	Is there a division in Christ ? was Paul nailed to the cross for you ? or were you given baptism in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I give praise to God that not one of you had baptism from me , but Crispus and Gaius ;
46001015	So that no one may be able to say that you had baptism in my name .
46001016	And I gave baptism to the house of Stephanas ; but I am not certain that any others had baptism from me .
46001017	For Christ sent me , not to give baptism , but to be a preacher of the good news : not with wise words , for fear that the cross of Christ might be made of no value .
46001018	For the word of the cross seems foolish to those who are on the way to destruction ; but to us who are on the way to salvation it is the power of God .
46001019	As it says in the holy Writings , I will put an end to the wisdom of the wise , and will put on one side the designs of those who have knowledge .
46001020	Where is the wise ? where is he who has knowledge of the law ? where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion ? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
46001021	For because , by the purpose of God , the world , with all its wisdom , had not the knowledge of God , it was God's pleasure , by so foolish a thing as preaching , to give salvation to those who had faith in him .
46001022	Seeing that the Jews make request for signs , and the Greeks are looking for knowledge :
46001023	But we give the good news of Christ on the cross , a hard thing to the Jews , and a foolish thing to the Gentiles ;
46001024	But to those of God's selection , Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power and the wisdom of God .
46001025	Because what seems foolish in God is wiser than men ; and what seems feeble in God is stronger than men .
46001026	For you see God's design for you , my brothers , that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh , not the strong , not the noble :
46001027	But God made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame ; and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong ;
46001028	And the low things of the world , and the things without honour , did God make selection of , yes , even the things which are not , so that he might make as nothing the things which are :
46001029	So that no flesh might have glory before God .
46001030	But God has given you a place in Christ Jesus , through whom God has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation , and made us holy :
46001031	So that , as it is said in the holy Writings , Whoever has a desire for glory , let his glory be in the Lord .
46002001	And when I came to you , my brothers , I did not come with wise words of knowledge , putting before you the secret of God .
46002002	For I had made the decision to have knowledge of nothing among you but only of Jesus Christ on the cross .
46002003	And I was with you without strength , in fear and in doubt .
46002004	And in my preaching there were no honeyed words of wisdom , but I was dependent on the power of the Spirit to make it clear to you :
46002005	So that your faith might be based not on man's wisdom but on the power of God .
46002006	But still we have wisdom for those who are complete in knowledge , though not the wisdom of this world , and not of the rulers of this world , who are coming to nothing :
46002007	But we give the news of the secret wisdom of God , which he had kept in store before the world came into existence , for our glory ;
46002008	Of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge : for if they had , they would not have put the Lord of glory on the cross :
46002009	But as it says in the holy Writings , Things which the eye saw not , and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man , such things as God has made ready for those who have love for him .
46002010	But God has given us the revelation of these things through his Spirit , for the Spirit makes search into all things , even the deep things of God .
46002011	For who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him ? in the same way , no one has knowledge of the things of God but the Spirit of God .
46002012	But we have not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which comes from God , so that we may have knowledge of the things which are freely given to us by God .
46002013	And these are the things which we say , not in the language of man's wisdom , but in words given to us by the Spirit , judging the things of the spirit by the help of the Spirit .
46002014	For the natural man is not able to take in the things of the Spirit of God : for they seem foolish to him , and he is not able to have knowledge of them , because such knowledge comes only through the Spirit .
46002015	But he who has the Spirit , though judging all things , is himself judged by no one .
46002016	For who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord , so as to be his teacher ? But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	And the teaching I gave you , my brothers , was such as I was able to give , not to those who have the Spirit , but to those who are still in the flesh , even to children in Christ .
46003002	I gave you milk and not meat , because you were , then , unable to take it , and even now you are not able ;
46003003	Because you are still in the flesh : for when there is envy and division among you , are you not still walking after the way of the flesh , even as natural men ?
46003004	For when one says , I am of Paul ; and another says , I am of Apollos ; are you not talking like natural men ?
46003005	What then is Apollos ? and what is Paul ? They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them .
46003006	I did the planting , Apollos did the watering , but God gave the increase .
46003007	So then the planter is nothing , and the waterer is nothing ; but God who gives the increase .
46003008	Now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end : but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work .
46003009	For we are workers with God : you are God's planting , God's building .
46003010	In the measure of the grace given to me , I , as a wise master-builder , have put the base in position , and another goes on building on it . But let every man take care what he puts on it .
46003011	For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	But on the base a man may put gold , silver , stones of great price , wood , dry grass , cut stems ;
46003013	Every man's work will be made clear in that day , because it will be tested by fire ; and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every man's work .
46003014	If any man's work comes through the test , he will have a reward .
46003015	If the fire puts an end to any man's work , it will be his loss : but he will get salvation himself , though as by fire .
46003016	Do you not see that you are God's holy house , and that the Spirit of God has his place in you ?
46003017	If anyone makes the house of God unclean , God will put an end to him ; for the house of God is holy , and you are his house .
46003018	Let no man have a false idea . If any man seems to himself to be wise among you , let him become foolish , so that he may be wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolish before God . As it is said in the holy Writings , He who takes the wise in their secret designs :
46003020	And again , The Lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise , that they are nothing .
46003021	So let no one take pride in men . For all things are yours ;
46003022	Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours ;
46003023	And you are Christ's ; and Christ is God's .
46004001	Let us be judged as servants of Christ , and as those who are responsible for the secret things of God .
46004002	And it is right for such servants to be safe persons .
46004003	But it is a small thing to me that I am judged by you or by man's judging ; I am not even a judge of myself .
46004004	For I am not conscious of any wrong in myself ; but this does not make me clear , for it is the Lord who is my judge .
46004005	For this reason let there be no judging before the time , till the Lord comes , who will make clear the secret things of the dark , and the designs of the heart ; and then will every man have his praise from God .
46004006	My brothers , it is because of you that I have taken Apollos and myself as examples of these things , so that in us you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy Writings , so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brother .
46004007	For who made you better than your brother ? or what have you that has not been given to you ? but if it has been given to you , what cause have you for pride , as if it had not been given to you ?
46004008	For even now you are full , even now you have wealth , you have been made kings without us : truly , I would be glad if you were kings , so that we might be kings with you .
46004009	For it seems to me that God has put us the Apostles last of all , as men whose fate is death : for we are put on view to the world , and to angels , and to men .
46004010	We are made to seem foolish for Christ , but you are wise in Christ ; we are feeble , but you are strong ; you have glory , but we have shame .
46004011	Even to this hour we are without food , drink , and clothing , we are given blows and have no certain resting-place ;
46004012	And with our hands we do the hardest work : when they give us curses we give blessings , when we undergo punishment we take it quietly ;
46004013	When evil things are said about us we give gentle answers : we are made as the unclean things of the world , as that for which no one has any use , even till now .
46004014	I am not saying these things to put you to shame , but so that , as my dear children , you may see what is right .
46004015	For even if you had ten thousand teachers in Christ , you have not more than one father : for in Christ Jesus I have given birth to you through the good news .
46004016	So my desire is that you take me as your example .
46004017	For this cause I have sent Timothy to you , who is my dear and true child in the Lord ; he will make clear to you my ways in Christ , even as I am teaching everywhere in every church .
46004018	Now some are full of pride , as if I was not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you in a short time , if it is pleasing to the Lord , and I will take note , not of the word of those who are full of pride , but of the power .
46004020	For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power .
46004021	What is your desire ? is my coming to be with punishment , or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit ?
46005001	It is said , in fact , that there is among you a sin of the flesh , such as is not seen even among the Gentiles , that one of you has his father's wife .
46005002	And in place of feeling sorrow , you are pleased with yourselves , so that he who has done this thing has not been sent away from among you .
46005003	For I myself , being present in spirit though not in body , have come to a decision about him who has done this thing ;
46005004	In the name of our Lord Jesus , when you have come together with my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
46005005	That this man is to be handed over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , so that his spirit may have forgiveness in the day of the Lord Jesus .
46005006	This pride of yours is not good . Do you not see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass ?
46005007	Take away , then , the old leaven , so that you may be a new mass , even as you are without leaven . For Christ has been put to death as our Passover .
46005008	Let us then keep the feast , not with old leaven , and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts , but with the unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings .
46005009	In my letter I said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh ;
46005010	But I had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church , or those who have a desire for and take the property of others , or those who give worship to images ; for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely :
46005011	But the sense of my letter was that if a brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the flesh , or had the desire for other people's property , or was in the way of using violent language , or being the worse for drink , or took by force what was not his , you might not keep company with such a one , or take food with him .
46005012	For it is no business of mine to be judging those who are outside ; but it is yours to be judging those who are among you ;
46005013	As for those who are outside , God is their judge . So put away the evil man from among you .
46006001	How is it , that if any one of you has a cause at law against another , he takes it before a Gentile judge and not before the saints ?
46006002	Is it not certain that the saints will be the judges of the world ? if then the world will be judged by you , are you unable to give a decision about the smallest things ?
46006003	Is it not certain that we are to be the judges of angels ? how much more then of the things of this life ?
46006004	If then there are questions to be judged in connection with the things of this life , why do you put them in the hands of those who have no position in the church ?
46006005	I say this to put you to shame . Is there not among you one wise man who may be able to give a decision between his brothers ?
46006006	But a brother who has a cause at law against another takes it before Gentile judges .
46006007	More than this , it is not to your credit to have causes at law with one another at all . Why not put up with wrong ? why not undergo loss ?
46006008	So far from doing this , you yourselves do wrong and take your brothers ' property .
46006009	Have you not knowledge that evil-doers will have no part in the kingdom of God ? Have no false ideas about this : no one who goes after the desires of the flesh , or gives worship to images , or is untrue when married , or is less than a man , or makes a wrong use of men ,
46006010	Or is a thief , or the worse for drink , or makes use of strong language , or takes by force what is not his , will have any part in the kingdom of God .
46006011	And such were some of you ; but you have been washed , you have been made holy , you have been given righteousness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God .
46006012	I am free to do all things ; but not all things are wise . I am free to do all things ; but I will not let myself come under the power of any .
46006013	Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food , and God will put an end to them together . But the body is not for the desires of the flesh , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body :
46006014	And God who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us by his power .
46006015	Do you not see that your bodies are part of the body of Christ ? how then may I take what is a part of the body of Christ and make it a part of the body of a loose woman ? such a thing may not be .
46006016	Or do you not see that he who is joined to a loose woman is one body with her ? for God has said , The two of them will become one flesh .
46006017	But he who is united to the Lord is one spirit .
46006018	Keep away from the desires of the flesh . Every sin which a man does is outside of the body ; but he who goes after the desires of the flesh does evil to his body .
46006019	Or are you not conscious that your body is a house for the Holy Spirit which is in you , and which has been given to you by God ? and you are not the owners of yourselves ;
46006020	For a payment has been made for you : let God be honoured in your body .
46007001	Now , as to the things in your letter to me : It is good for a man to have nothing to do with a woman .
46007002	But because of the desires of the flesh , let every man have his wife , and every woman her husband .
46007003	Let the husband give to the wife what is right ; and let the wife do the same to the husband .
46007004	The wife has not power over her body , but the husband ; and in the same way the husband has not power over his body , but the wife .
46007005	Do not keep back from one another what is right , but only for a short time , and by agreement , so that you may give yourselves to prayer , and come together again ; so that Satan may not get the better of you through your loss of self-control .
46007006	But this I say as my opinion , and not as an order of the Lord .
46007007	It is my desire that all men might be even as I am . But every man has the power of his special way of life given him by God , one in this way and one in that .
46007008	But I say to the unmarried and to the widows , It is good for them to be even as I am .
46007009	But if they have not self-control let them get married ; for married life is better than the burning of desire .
46007010	But to the married I give orders , though not I but the Lord , that the wife may not go away from her husband
46007011	( Or if she goes away from him , let her keep unmarried , or be united to her husband again ) ; and that the husband may not go away from his wife .
46007012	But to the rest I say , and not the Lord ; If a brother has a wife who is not a Christian , and it is her desire to go on living with him , let him not go away from her .
46007013	And if a woman has a husband who is not a Christian , and it is his desire to go on living with her , let her not go away from her husband .
46007014	For the husband who has not faith is made holy through his Christian wife , and the wife who is not a Christian is made holy through the brother : if not , your children would be unholy , but now are they holy .
46007015	But if the one who is not a Christian has a desire to go away , let it be so : the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other : but it is God's pleasure that we may be at peace with one another .
46007016	For how may you be certain , O wife , that you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband ? or you , O husband , that you may not do the same for your wife ?
46007017	Only , as the Lord has given to a man , and as is the purpose of God for him , so let him go on living . And these are my orders for all the churches .
46007018	If any man who is a Christian has had circumcision , let him keep so ; and if any man who is a Christian has not had circumcision , let him make no change .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing , and its opposite is nothing , but only doing the orders of God is of value .
46007020	Let every man keep the position in which he has been placed by God .
46007021	If you were a servant when you became a Christian , let it not be a grief to you ; but if you have a chance to become free , make use of it .
46007022	For he who was a servant when he became a Christian is the Lord's free man ; and he who was free when he became a Christian is the Lord's servant .
46007023	It is the Lord who has made payment for you : be not servants of men .
46007024	My brothers , let every man keep in that condition which is the purpose of God for him .
46007025	Now about virgins I have no orders from the Lord : but I give my opinion as one to whom the Lord has given mercy to be true to him .
46007026	In my opinion then , because of the present trouble , it is good for a man to keep as he is .
46007027	If you are married to a wife , make no attempt to get free from her : if you are free from a wife , do not take a wife .
46007028	If you get married it is not a sin ; and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin . But those who do so will have trouble in the flesh . But I will not be hard on you .
46007029	But I say this , my brothers , the time is short ; and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if they had them not ;
46007030	And for those who are in sorrow , to give no signs of it ; and for those who are glad , to give no signs of joy ; and for those who are getting property , to be as if they had nothing ;
46007031	And for those who make use of the world , not to be using it fully ; for this world's way of life will quickly come to an end .
46007032	But it is my desire for you to be free from cares . The unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the Lord , how he may give pleasure to the Lord :
46007033	But the married man gives his attention to the things of this world , how he may give pleasure to his wife .
46007034	And the wife is not the same as the virgin . The virgin gives her mind to the things of the Lord , so that she may be holy in body and in spirit : but the married woman takes thought for the things of the world , how she may give pleasure to her husband .
46007035	Now I say this for your profit ; not to make things hard for you , but because of what is right , and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the Lord .
46007036	But if , in any man's opinion , he is not doing what is right for his virgin , if she is past her best years , and there is need for it , let him do what seems right to him ; it is no sin ; let them be married .
46007037	But the man who is strong in mind and purpose , who is not forced but has control over his desires , does well if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin .
46007038	So then , he who gets married to his virgin does well , and he who keeps her unmarried does better .
46007039	It is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living ; but when her husband is dead , she is free to be married to another ; but only to a Christian .
46007040	But it will be better for her to keep as she is , in my opinion : and it seems to me that I have the Spirit of God .
46008001	Now about things offered to images : we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge . Knowledge gives pride , but love gives true strength .
46008002	If anyone seems to himself to have knowledge , so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything ;
46008003	But if anyone has love for God , God has knowledge of him .
46008004	So , then , as to the question of taking food offered to images , we are certain that an image is nothing in the world , and that there is no God but one .
46008005	For though there are those who have the name of gods , in heaven or on earth , as there are a number of gods and a number of lords ,
46008006	There is for us only one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we are for him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we have our being through him .
46008007	Still , all men have not that knowledge : but some , being used till now to the image , are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image ; and because they are not strong in the faith , their minds are troubled .
46008008	But God's approval of us is not based on the food we take : if we do not take it we are no worse for it ; and if we take it we are no better .
46008009	But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble .
46008010	For if a man sees you , who have knowledge , taking food as a guest in the house of an image , will it not give him , if he is feeble , the idea that he may take food offered to images ?
46008011	And so , through your knowledge , you are the cause of destruction to your brother , for whom Christ underwent death .
46008012	And in this way , doing evil to the brothers , and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble , you are sinning against Christ .
46008013	For this reason , if food is a cause of trouble to my brother , I will give up taking meat for ever , so that I may not be a cause of trouble to my brother .
46009001	Am I not free ? am I not an Apostle ? have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? are you not my work in the Lord ?
46009002	If to others I am not an Apostle , at least I am one to you : for the fact that you are Christians is the sign that I am an Apostle .
46009003	My answer to those who are judging me is this .
46009004	Have we no right to take food and drink ?
46009005	Have we no right to take about with us a Christian wife , like the rest of the Apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ?
46009006	Or I only and Barnabas , have we no right to take a rest from work ?
46009007	Who ever goes to war without looking to someone to be responsible for his payment ? who puts in vines and does not take the fruit of them ? or who takes care of sheep without drinking of their milk ?
46009008	Am I talking as a man ? does not the law say the same ?
46009009	For it says in the law of Moses , It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it . Is it for the oxen that God is giving orders ?
46009010	Or has he us in mind ? Yes , it was said for us ; because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in hope , and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a part in the fruits of it .
46009011	If we have been planting the things of the Spirit for you , does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world ?
46009012	If others have a part in this right over you , have we not even more ? But we did not make use of our right , so that we might put nothing in the way of the good news of Christ .
46009013	Do you not see that the servants of the holy things get their living from the Temple , and the servants of the altar have their part in the food which is offered on the altar ?
46009014	Even so did the Lord give orders that the preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news .
46009015	But I have not made use of any of these things : and I am not writing this in the hope that it may be so for me : for it would be better for me to undergo death , than for any man to make this pride of mine of no effect .
46009016	For if I am a preacher of the good news , I have no cause for pride in this ; because I am forced to do so , for a curse is on me if I do not .
46009017	But if I do it gladly , I have a reward ; and if not , I am under orders to do it .
46009018	What then is my reward ? This , that when I am giving the good news , I may give it without payment , not making use of my rights as a preacher of the good news .
46009019	For though I was free from all men , I made myself a servant to all , so that more might have salvation .
46009020	And to the Jews I was as a Jew , so that I might give the good news to them ; to those under the law I was the same , not as being myself under the law , but so that I might give the good news to those under the law .
46009021	To those without the law I was as one without the law , not as being without law to God , but as under law to Christ , so that I might give the good news to those without the law .
46009022	To the feeble , I was as one who is feeble , so that they might have salvation : I have been all things to all men , so that some at least might have salvation .
46009023	And I do all things for the cause of the good news , so that I may have a part in it .
46009024	Do you not see that in a running competition all take part , but only one gets the reward ? So let your minds be fixed on the reward .
46009025	And every man who takes part in the sports has self-control in all things . Now they do it to get a crown which is of this world , but we for an eternal crown .
46009026	So then I am running , not uncertainly ; so I am fighting , not as one who gives blows in the air :
46009027	But I give blows to my body , and keep it under control , for fear that , after having given the good news to others , I myself might not have God's approval .
46010001	For it is my desire , my brothers , that you may keep in mind how all our fathers were under the cloud , and they all went through the sea ;
46010002	And they all had baptism from Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
46010003	And they all took the same holy food ;
46010004	And the same holy drink : for they all took of the water from the holy rock which came after them : and the rock was Christ .
46010005	But with most of them God was not pleased : for they came to their end in the waste land .
46010006	Now these things were for an example to us , so that our hearts might not go after evil things , as they did .
46010007	Then do not go after false gods , as some of them did ; as it is said in the holy Writings , After resting and feasting , the people got up to take their pleasure .
46010008	Again , let us not give way to the desires of the flesh , as some of them did , of whom twenty-three thousand came to their end in one day .
46010009	And let us not put the Lord to the test , as some of them did , and came to their death by snakes .
46010010	And do not say evil things against the Lord , as some of them did , and destruction overtook them .
46010011	Now these things were done as an example ; and were put down in writing for our teaching , on whom the last days have come .
46010012	So let him who seems to himself to be safe go in fear of a fall .
46010013	You have been put to no test but such as is common to man : and God is true , who will not let any test come on you which you are not able to undergo ; but he will make with the test a way out of it , so that you may be able to go through it .
46010014	For this cause , my dear brothers , give no worship to false gods .
46010015	What I am saying is for wise men , do you be the judges of it .
46010016	The cup of blessing which we take , does it not give us a part in the blood of Christ ? and is not the broken bread a taking part in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Because we , being a number of persons , are one bread , we are one body : for we all take part in the one bread .
46010018	See Israel after the flesh : do not those who take as food the offerings of the altar take a part in the altar ?
46010019	Do I say , then , that what is offered to images is anything , or that the image is anything ?
46010020	What I say is that the things offered by the Gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to God ; and it is not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits .
46010021	It is not possible for you , at the same time , to take the cup of the Lord and the cup of evil spirits ; you may not take part in the table of the Lord and the table of evil spirits .
46010022	Or may we be the cause of envy to the Lord ? are we stronger than he ?
46010023	We are free to do all things , but there are things which it is not wise to do . We are free to do all things , but not all things are for the common good .
46010024	Let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself , but equally to his neighbour's good .
46010025	Whatever meat may be had at the public market , take as food without question of right or wrong ;
46010026	For the earth is the Lord's and all things in it .
46010027	If a Gentile makes a feast for you , and you are pleased to go as a guest , take whatever is put before you , without question of right or wrong .
46010028	But if anyone says to you , This food has been used as an offering , do not take it , on account of him who said it , and on account of his sense of right and wrong :
46010029	Right and wrong , I say , not for you , but for the other man ; for the fact that I am free is not dependent on another man's sense of right or wrong .
46010030	But if I give praise to God for the food which I take , let no man say evil of me for that reason .
46010031	So then , if it is a question of food or drink , or any other thing , whatever you do , do all to the glory of God .
46010032	Give no cause of trouble to Jews , or to Greeks , or to the church of God .
46010033	Even as I give way to all men in all things , not looking for profit for myself , but for the good of others , that they may get salvation .
46011001	So take me for your example , even as I take Christ for mine .
46011002	Now I am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things , and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you .
46011003	But it is important for you to keep this fact in mind , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man who takes part in prayer , or gives teaching as a prophet , with his head covered , puts shame on his head .
46011005	But every woman who does so with her head unveiled , puts shame on her head : for it is the same as if her hair was cut off .
46011006	For if a woman is not veiled , let her hair be cut off ; but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off , let her be veiled .
46011007	For it is not right for a man to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
46011008	For the man did not come from the woman , but the woman from the man .
46011009	And the man was not made for the woman , but the woman for the man .
46011010	For this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head , because of the angels .
46011011	But the woman is not separate from the man , and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord .
46011012	For as the woman is from the man , so the man is through the woman ; but all things are from God .
46011013	Be judges yourselves of the question : does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled ?
46011014	Does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair , it is a cause of shame to him ?
46011015	But if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given to her for a covering .
46011016	But if any man will not be ruled in this question , this is not our way of doing things , and it is not done in the churches of God .
46011017	But in giving you this order , there is one thing about which I am not pleased : it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse .
46011018	For first of all , it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church , there are divisions among you , and I take the statement to be true in part .
46011019	For divisions are necessary among you , in order that those who have God's approval may be clearly seen among you .
46011020	But now , when you come together , it is not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord :
46011021	For when you take your food , everyone takes his meal before the other ; and one has not enough food , and another is the worse for drink .
46011022	What ? have you not houses to take your meals in ? or have you no respect for the church of God , putting the poor to shame ? What am I to say to you ? am I to give you praise ? certainly not .
46011023	For it was handed down to me from the Lord , as I gave it to you , that the Lord Jesus , on the night when Judas was false to him , took bread ,
46011024	And when it had been broken with an act of praise , he said , This is my body which is for you : do this in memory of me .
46011025	In the same way , with the cup , after the meal , he said , This cup is the new testament in my blood : do this , whenever you take it , in memory of me .
46011026	For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes .
46011027	If , then , anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit , he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself .
46011029	For a man puts himself in danger , if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the Lord's body .
46011030	For this cause a number of you are feeble and ill , and a number are dead .
46011031	But if we were true judges of ourselves , punishment would not come on us .
46011032	But if punishment does come , it is sent by the Lord , so that we may be safe when the world is judged .
46011033	So then , my brothers , when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord , let there be waiting for one another .
46011034	If any man is in need of food , let him take his meal in his house ; so that you may not come together to your damage . And the rest I will put in order when I come .
46012001	But about the things of the spirit , my brothers , it is not right for you to be without teaching .
46012002	You are conscious that when you were Gentiles , in whatever way you were guided , you went after images without voice or power .
46012003	So it is my desire for you to be clear about this ; that no one is able to say by the Spirit of God that Jesus is cursed ; and no one is able to say that Jesus is Lord , but by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	Now there are different qualities given to men , but the same Spirit .
46012005	And there are different sorts of servants , but the same Lord .
46012006	And there are different operations , but the same God , who is working all things in all .
46012007	But to every man some form of the Spirit's working is given for the common good .
46012008	For to one are given words of wisdom through the Spirit ; and to another words of knowledge through the same Spirit :
46012009	To another faith in the same Spirit ; and to another the power of taking away disease , by the one Spirit ;
46012010	And to another the power of working wonders ; and to another the prophet's word ; and to another the power of testing spirits ; to another different sorts of tongues ; and to another the power of making clear the sense of the tongues :
46012011	But all these are the operations of the one and the same Spirit , giving to every man separately as his pleasure is .
46012012	For as the body is one , and has a number of parts , and all the parts make one body , so is Christ .
46012013	For through the baptism of the one Spirit we were all formed into one body , Jews or Greeks , servants or free men , and were all made full of the same Spirit .
46012014	For the body is not one part , but a number of parts .
46012015	If the foot says , Because I am not the hand , I am not a part of the body ; it is no less a part of the body .
46012016	And if the ear says , Because I am not the eye , I am not a part of the body ; it is a part of the body all the same .
46012017	If all the body was an eye , where would be the hearing ? if all was hearing , where would be the smelling ?
46012018	But now God has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him .
46012019	And if they were all one part , where would the body be ?
46012020	But now they are all different parts , but one body .
46012021	And the eye may not say to the hand , I have no need of you : or again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
46012022	No , those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary ;
46012023	And to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour ; and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect ;
46012024	But those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care : and so the body has been joined together by God in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it ;
46012025	So that there might be no division in the body ; but all the parts might have the same care for one another .
46012026	And if there is pain in one part of the body , all the parts will be feeling it ; or if one part is honoured , all the parts will be glad .
46012027	Now you are the body of Christ , and every one of you the separate parts of it .
46012028	And God has put some in the church , first , Apostles ; second , prophets ; third , teachers ; then those with wonder-working powers , then those with the power of taking away disease , helpers , wise guides , users of strange tongues .
46012029	Are all Apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? have all the power of working wonders ?
46012030	Are all able to take away disease ? have all the power of tongues ? are all able to give their sense ?
46012031	But let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the Spirit . And now I am pointing out to you an even better way .
46013001	If I make use of the tongues of men and of angels , and have not love , I am like sounding brass , or a loud-tongued bell .
46013002	And if I have a prophet's power , and have knowledge of all secret things ; and if I have all faith , by which mountains may be moved from their place , but have not love , I am nothing .
46013003	And if I give all my goods to the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but have not love , it is of no profit to me .
46013004	Love is never tired of waiting ; love is kind ; love has no envy ; love has no high opinion of itself , love has no pride ;
46013005	Love's ways are ever fair , it takes no thought for itself ; it is not quickly made angry , it takes no account of evil ;
46013006	It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing , but has joy in what is true ;
46013007	Love has the power of undergoing all things , having faith in all things , hoping all things .
46013008	Though the prophet's word may come to an end , tongues come to nothing , and knowledge have no more value , love has no end .
46013009	For our knowledge is only in part , and the prophet's word gives only a part of what is true :
46013010	But when that which is complete is come , then that which is in part will be no longer necessary .
46013011	When I was a child , I made use of a child's language , I had a child's feelings and a child's thoughts : now that I am a man , I have put away the things of a child .
46013012	For now we see things in a glass , darkly ; but then face to face : now my knowledge is in part ; then it will be complete , even as God's knowledge of me .
46013013	But now we still have faith , hope , love , these three ; and the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Go after love ; still desiring to have the things which the Spirit gives , but most of all that you may have the prophet's power .
46014002	For he who makes use of tongues is not talking to men but to God ; because no one has the sense of what he is saying ; but in the Spirit he is talking of secret things .
46014003	But the word of the prophet gives men knowledge and comfort and strength .
46014004	He who makes use of tongues may do good to himself ; but he who gives the prophet's word does good to the church .
46014005	Now though it is my desire for you all to have the power of tongues , it would give me more pleasure to be hearing the prophet's word from you ; for this is a greater thing than using tongues , if the sense is not given at the same time , for the good of the church .
46014006	But , now , my brothers , if I come to you using tongues , what profit will it be to you , if I do not give you a revelation , or knowledge , or the word of the prophet , or teaching ?
46014007	Even things without life , having a voice , such as a music-pipe or other instrument , if they do not give out different sounds , who may be certain what is being played ?
46014008	For if the war-horn gives out an uncertain note , who will get ready for the fight ?
46014009	So if you , in using a strange tongue , say words which have no sense , how will anyone take in what you are saying ? for you will be talking to the air .
46014010	There are , it may be , a number of different voices in the world , and no voice is without sense .
46014011	But if the sense of the voice is not clear to me , I am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking , and he will be the same to me .
46014012	So if you are desiring the things which the Spirit gives , let your minds be turned first to the things which are for the good of the church .
46014013	For this reason , let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may , at the same time , be able to give the sense .
46014014	For if I make use of tongues in my prayers , my spirit makes the prayer , but not my mind .
46014015	What then ? let my prayer be from the spirit , and equally from the mind ; let my song be from the spirit , and equally from mind .
46014016	For if you give a blessing with the spirit , how will the man who has no knowledge say , So be it , after your prayer , seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying ?
46014017	For your giving of the blessing is certainly well done , but of no profit to the man without knowledge .
46014018	I give praise to God that I am able to make use of tongues more than you all :
46014019	But in the church it would be better for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear , so that others might have profit , than ten thousand words in a strange tongue .
46014020	My brothers , do not be children in mind : in evil be as little children , but in mind be of full growth .
46014021	In the law it is said , By men of other tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people ; and not even so will they give ear to me , says the Lord .
46014022	For this reason tongues are for a sign , not to those who have faith , but to those who have not : but the prophet's word is for those who have faith , and not for the rest who have not .
46014023	If , then , the church has come together , and all are using tongues , and there come in men without knowledge or faith , will they not say that you are unbalanced ?
46014024	But if all are teaching as prophets , and a man without faith or knowledge comes in , he is tested by all , he is judged by all ;
46014025	The secrets of his heart are made clear ; and he will go down on his face and give worship to God , saying that God is truly among you .
46014026	What is it then , my brothers ? when you come together everyone has a holy song , or a revelation , or a tongue , or is giving the sense of it . Let everything be done for the common good .
46014027	If any man makes use of a tongue , let it not be more than two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let someone give the sense :
46014028	But if there is no one to give the sense , let him keep quiet in the church ; and let his words be to himself and to God .
46014029	And let the prophets give their words , but not more than two or three , and let the others be judges of what they say .
46014030	But if a revelation is given to another who is seated near , let the first be quiet .
46014031	For you may all be prophets in turn so that all may get knowledge and comfort ;
46014032	And the spirits of the prophets are controlled by the prophets ;
46014033	For God is not a God whose ways are without order , but a God of peace ; as in all the churches of the saints .
46014034	Let women keep quiet in the churches : for it is not right for them to be talking ; but let them be under control , as it says in the law .
46014035	And if they have a desire for knowledge about anything , let them put questions to their husbands privately : for talking in the church puts shame on a woman .
46014036	What ? was it from you that the word of God went out ? or did it only come in to you ?
46014037	If any man seems to himself to be a prophet or to have the Spirit , let him take note of the things which I am writing to you , as being the word of the Lord .
46014038	But if any man is without knowledge , let him be so .
46014039	So then , my brothers , let it be your chief desire to be prophets ; but let no one be stopped from using tongues .
46014040	Let all things be done in the right and ordered way .
46015001	Now I am going to make clear to you , my brothers , what the good news was which I gave to you , and which you took , and on which your faith is based ,
46015002	By which you have salvation ; that is to say , the form in which it was given to you , if it is fixed in your minds , and if your faith in it is not without effect .
46015003	For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me , how Christ underwent death for our sins , as it says in the Writings ;
46015004	And he was put in the place of the dead ; and on the third day he came back from the dead , as it says in the Writings ;
46015005	And he was seen by Cephas ; then by the twelve ;
46015006	Then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time , most of whom are still living , but some are sleeping ;
46015007	Then he was seen by James ; then by all the Apostles .
46015008	And last of all , as by one whose birth was out of the right time , he was seen by me .
46015009	For I am the least of the Apostles , having no right to be named an Apostle , because of my cruel attacks on the church of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God , I am what I am : and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing ; for I did more work than all of them ; though not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
46015011	If then it is I who am the preacher , or they , this is our word , and to this you have given your faith .
46015012	Now if the good news says that Christ came back from the dead , how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead ?
46015013	But if there is no coming back from the dead , then Christ has not come back from the dead :
46015014	And if Christ did not come again from the dead , then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect .
46015015	Yes , and we are seen to be false witnesses of God ; because we gave witness of God that by his power Christ came again from the dead : which is not true if there is no coming back from the dead .
46015016	For if it is not possible for the dead to come to life again , then Christ has not come to life again :
46015017	And if that is so , your faith is of no effect ; you are still in your sins .
46015018	And , in addition , the dead in Christ have gone to destruction .
46015019	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most unhappy .
46015020	But now Christ has truly come back from the dead , the first-fruits of those who are sleeping .
46015021	For as by man came death , so by man there is a coming back from the dead .
46015022	For as in Adam death comes to all , so in Christ will all come back to life .
46015023	But every man in his right order : Christ the first-fruits ; then those who are Christ's at his coming .
46015024	Then comes the end , when he will give up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he will have put an end to all rule and to all authority and power .
46015025	For his rule will go on till he has put all those who are against him under his feet .
46015026	The last power to come to an end is death .
46015027	For , as it says , He has put all things under his feet . But when he says , All things are put under him , it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him .
46015028	And when all things have been put under him , then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under him , so that God may be all in all .
46015029	Again , what will they do who are given baptism for the dead ? if the dead do not come back at all , why are people given baptism for them ?
46015030	And why are we in danger every hour ?
46015031	Yes , truly , by your pride in me , my brothers in Christ Jesus our Lord , my life is one long death .
46015032	If , after the way of men , I was fighting with beasts at Ephesus , what profit is it to me ? If the dead do not come to life again , let us take our pleasure in feasting , for tomorrow we come to an end .
46015033	Do not be tricked by false words : evil company does damage to good behaviour .
46015034	Be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin ; for some have no knowledge of God : I say this to put you to shame .
46015035	But someone will say , How do the dead come back ? and with what sort of body do they come ?
46015036	Foolish man , it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again :
46015037	And when you put it into the earth , you do not put in the body which it will be , but only the seed , of grain or some other sort of plant ;
46015038	But God gives it a body , as it is pleasing to him , and to every seed its special body .
46015039	All flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one flesh of men , another of beasts , another of birds , and another of fishes .
46015040	And there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth , but the glory of the one is different from that of the other .
46015041	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for the glory of one star is different from that of another .
46015042	So is it with the coming back from the dead . It is planted in death ; it comes again in life :
46015043	It is planted in shame ; it comes again in glory : feeble when it is planted , it comes again in power :
46015044	It is planted a natural body ; it comes again as a body of the spirit . If there is a natural body , there is equally a body of the spirit .
46015045	And so it is said , The first man Adam was a living soul . The last Adam is a life-giving spirit .
46015046	But that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit .
46015047	The first man is from the earth , and of the earth : the second man is from heaven .
46015048	Those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth : and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven .
46015049	And in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth , so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven .
46015050	Now I say this , my brothers , that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God ; and death may not have a part in life .
46015051	See , I am giving you the revelation of a secret : we will not all come to the sleep of death , but we will all be changed .
46015052	In a second , in the shutting of an eye , at the sound of the last horn : for at that sound the dead will come again , free for ever from the power of death , and we will be changed .
46015053	For this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death , and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life .
46015054	But when this has taken place , then that which was said in the Writings will come true , Death is overcome by life .
46015055	O death , where is your power ? O death , where are your pains ?
46015056	The pain of death is sin ; and the power of sin is the law :
46015057	But praise be to God who gives us strength to overcome through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	For this cause , my dear brothers , be strong in purpose and unmoved , ever giving yourselves to the work of the Lord , because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the Lord .
46016001	Now about the giving of money for the saints , as I gave orders to the churches of Galatia , so do you .
46016002	On the first day of the week , let every one of you put by him in store , in measure as he has done well in business , so that it may not be necessary to get money together when I come .
46016003	And when I come , I will send the men of your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to Jerusalem .
46016004	And if it is possible for me to go there , they will go with me .
46016005	But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia , for that is my purpose ;
46016006	But I may be with you for a time , or even for the winter , so that you may see me on my way , wherever I go .
46016007	For it is not my desire to see you now , on my way ; because it is my hope to be with you for some time , if that is the Lord's pleasure .
46016008	But I will be at Ephesus till Pentecost ;
46016009	For a great and important door there is open to me , and there are a number of people against me .
46016010	Now if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without fear ; because he is doing the Lord's work , even as I am :
46016011	See then that he has the honour which is right . But send him on his way in peace , so that he may come to me : for I am looking for him with the brothers .
46016012	But as for Apollos , the brother , I had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers , but it was not his pleasure to come now ; but he will come when he has a chance .
46016013	Be on the watch , unmoved in the faith , and be strong like men .
46016014	Let all you do be done in love .
46016015	Now I make my request to you , my brothers , for you have knowledge that the house of Stephanas is the first-fruits of Achaia , and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints ,
46016016	That you put yourselves under such , and under everyone who is helping the Lord's work .
46016017	And I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for they have done what was needed to make your work complete .
46016018	For they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours : for which cause give respect to such people .
46016019	The churches of Asia send their love to you . So do Aquila and Prisca , with the church which is in their house .
46016020	All the brothers send their love to you . Give one another a holy kiss .
46016021	I , Paul , send you these words of love in my writing .
46016022	If any man has not love for the Lord , let him be cursed . Maran atha ( our Lord comes ) .
46016023	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
46016024	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . So be it .
47001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God , and Timothy the brother , to the church of God which is in Corinth , with all the saints who are in all Achaia :
47001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort ;
47001004	Who gives us comfort in all our troubles , so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
47001005	For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent , so through Christ does our comfort become greater .
47001006	But if we are troubled , it is for your comfort and salvation ; or if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo :
47001007	And our hope for you is certain ; in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles , so you will take part in the comfort .
47001008	For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia , that the weight of it was very great , more than our power , so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life :
47001009	Yes , we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves , so that our hope might not be in ourselves , but in God who is able to give life to the dead :
47001010	Who gave us salvation from so great a death : on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation ;
47001011	You at the same time helping together by your prayer for us ; so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons , praise may go up to God for us from all of them .
47001012	For our glory is in this , in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world , and most of all in relation to you , has been holy and true in the eyes of God ; not in the wisdom of the flesh , but in the grace of God .
47001013	For in our letters we say no other things to you , but those which you are reading , and to which you give agreement , and , it is my hope , will go on doing so to the end :
47001014	Even as you have been ready , in part , to say that we are your glory , in the same way that you are ours , in the day of the Lord Jesus .
47001015	And being certain of this , it was my purpose to come to you before , so that you might have a second grace ;
47001016	And by way of Corinth to go into Macedonia , and from there to come back again to you , so that you might send me on my way to Judaea .
47001017	If then I had such a purpose , did I seem to be changing suddenly ? or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh , saying , Yes , today , and , No , tomorrow ?
47001018	As God is true , our word to you is not Yes and No .
47001019	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , whom we were preaching among you , even I and Silvanus and Timothy , was not Yes and No , but in him is Yes .
47001020	For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God : and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect , to the glory of God through us .
47001021	Now he who makes our faith strong together with you , in Christ , and has given us of his grace , is God ;
47001022	And it is he who has put his stamp on us , even the Spirit , as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory .
47001023	But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time .
47001024	Not that we have authority over your faith , but we are helpers of your joy : for it is faith which is your support .
47002001	But it was my decision for myself , not to come again to you with sorrow .
47002002	For if I give you sorrow , who then will make me glad , but he who is made sad by me ?
47002003	And I said this very thing in my letter , for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy ; being certain of this , that my joy is the joy of you all .
47002004	For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you ; not to give you sorrow , but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you .
47002005	But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow , he has been so , not to me only , but in some measure to all of you ( I say this that I may not be over-hard on you ) .
47002006	Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him ;
47002007	So that now , on the other hand , it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you , for fear that his sorrow may be over-great .
47002008	For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts .
47002009	And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things .
47002010	But if you give forgiveness to anyone , I do the same : for if I have given forgiveness for anything , I have done it because of you , in the person of Christ ;
47002011	So that Satan may not get the better of us : for we are not without knowledge of his designs .
47002012	Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ , and there was an open door for me in the Lord ,
47002013	I had no rest in my spirit because Titus my brother was not there : so I went away from them , and came into Macedonia .
47002014	But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ , and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him .
47002015	For we are a sweet perfume of Christ to God in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction ;
47002016	To the one it is a perfume of death to death ; to the other a perfume of life to life . And who is enough for such things ?
47002017	For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit : but our words are true , as from God , being said as before God in Christ .
47003001	Do we seem to be again attempting to put ourselves in the right ? or have we need , as some have , of letters of approval to you or from you ?
47003002	You yourselves are our letter , whose writing is in our heart , open for every man's reading and knowledge ;
47003003	For you are clearly a letter of Christ , the fruit of our work , recorded not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in stone , but in hearts of flesh .
47003004	And this is the certain faith which we have in God through Christ :
47003005	Not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit ; but our power comes from God ;
47003006	Who has made us able to be servants of a new agreement ; not of the letter , but of the Spirit : for the letter gives death , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	For if the operation of the law , giving death , recorded in letters on stone , came with glory , so that the eyes of the children of Israel had to be turned away from the face of Moses because of its glory , a glory which was only for a time :
47003008	Will not the operation of the Spirit have a much greater glory ?
47003009	For if the operation of the law , producing punishment , had its glory , how much greater will be the operation of the Spirit causing righteousness ?
47003010	For the glory of the first no longer seems to be glory , because of the greater glory of that which comes after .
47003011	For if the order which was for a time had its glory , much more will the eternal order have its glory .
47003012	Having then such a hope , we keep nothing back ,
47003013	And are not like Moses , who put a veil on his face , so that the children of Israel might not see clearly to the end of the present order of things :
47003014	But their minds were made hard : for to this very day at the reading of the old agreement the same veil is still unlifted ; though it is taken away in Christ .
47003015	But to this day , at the reading of the law of Moses , a veil is over their heart .
47003016	But when it is turned to the Lord , the veil will be taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there the heart is free .
47003018	But we all , with unveiled face giving back as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as from the Lord who is the Spirit .
47004001	For this reason , because we have been made servants of this new order , through the mercy given to us , we are strong :
47004002	And we have given up the secret things of shame , not walking in false ways , and not making use of the word of God with deceit ; but by the revelation of what is true , as before God , we have the approval of every man's sense of right and wrong .
47004003	But if our good news is veiled , it is veiled from those who are on the way to destruction :
47004004	Because the god of this world has made blind the minds of those who have not faith , so that the light of the good news of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , might not be shining on them .
47004005	For our preaching is not about ourselves , but about Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your servants through Jesus .
47004006	Seeing that it is God who said , Let light be shining out of the dark , who has put in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
47004007	But we have this wealth in vessels of earth , so that it may be seen that the power comes not from us but from God ;
47004008	Troubles are round us on every side , but we are not shut in ; things are hard for us , but we see a way out of them ;
47004009	We are cruelly attacked , but not without hope ; we are made low , but we are not without help ;
47004010	In our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our bodies .
47004011	For , while living , we are still being given up to death because of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may be seen in our flesh , though it is under the power of death .
47004012	So then , death is working in us , but life in you .
47004013	But having the same spirit of faith , as it is said in the Writings , The words of my mouth came from the faith in my heart ; in the same way , our words are the outcome of our faith ;
47004014	Because we are certain that he who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead , will do the same for us , and will give us a place in his glory with you .
47004015	For we go through all things on account of you , because the greater the number to whom the grace is given , the greater is the praise to the glory of God .
47004016	For which cause we do not give way to weariness ; but though our outer man is getting feebler , our inner man is made new day by day .
47004017	For our present trouble , which is only for a short time , is working out for us a much greater weight of glory ;
47004018	While our minds are not on the things which are seen , but on the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are for a time ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
47005001	For we are conscious that if this our tent of flesh is taken down , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal , in heaven .
47005002	For in this we are crying in weariness , greatly desiring to be clothed with our house from heaven :
47005003	So that our spirits may not be unclothed .
47005004	For truly , we who are in this tent do give out cries of weariness , for the weight of care which is on us ; not because we are desiring to be free from the body , but so that we may have our new body , and death may be overcome by life .
47005005	Now he who has made us for this very thing is God , who has given us the Spirit as a witness of what is to come .
47005006	So , then , we are ever without fear , and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the Lord ,
47005007	( For we are walking by faith , not by seeing , )
47005008	We are without fear , desiring to be free from the body , and to be with the Lord .
47005009	For this reason we make it our purpose , in the body or away from it , to be well-pleasing to him .
47005010	For we all have to come before Christ to be judged ; so that every one of us may get his reward for the things done in the body , good or bad .
47005011	Having in mind , then , the fear of the Lord , we put these things before men , but God sees our hearts ; and it is my hope that we may seem right in your eyes .
47005012	We are not again requesting your approval , but we are giving you the chance of taking pride in us , so that you may be able to give an answer to those whose glory is in seeming , and not in the heart .
47005013	For if we are foolish , it is to God ; or if we are serious , it is for you .
47005014	For it is the love of Christ which is moving us ; because we are of the opinion that if one was put to death for all , then all have undergone death ;
47005015	And that he underwent death for all , so that the living might no longer be living to themselves , but to him who underwent death for them and came back from the dead .
47005016	For this reason , from this time forward we have knowledge of no man after the flesh : even if we have had knowledge of Christ after the flesh , we have no longer any such knowledge .
47005017	So if any man is in Christ , he is in a new world : the old things have come to an end ; they have truly become new .
47005018	But all things are of God , who has made us at peace with himself through Christ , and has given to us the work of making peace ;
47005019	That is , that God was in Christ making peace between the world and himself , not putting their sins to their account , and having given to us the preaching of this news of peace .
47005020	So we are the representatives of Christ , as if God was making a request to you through us : we make our request to you , in the name of Christ , be at peace with God .
47005021	For him who had no knowledge of sin God made to be sin for us ; so that we might become the righteousness of God in him .
47006001	We then , working together with God , make our request to you not to take the grace of God to no purpose .
47006002	( For he says , I have given ear to you at a good time , and I have been your helper in a day of salvation : see , now is the good time ; now is the day of salvation ) :
47006003	Giving no cause for trouble in anything , so that no one may be able to say anything against our work ;
47006004	But in everything making it clear that we are the servants of God , in quiet strength , in troubles , in need , in sorrow ,
47006005	In blows , in prisons , in attacks , in hard work , in watchings , in going without food ;
47006006	In a clean heart , in knowledge , in long waiting , in being kind , in the Holy Spirit , in true love ,
47006007	In the true word , in the power of God ; with the arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
47006008	By glory and by shame , by an evil name and a good name ; as untrue , and still true ;
47006009	Unnoted , but still kept fully in mind ; as near to death , but still living ; as undergoing punishment , but not put to death ;
47006010	As full of sorrow , but ever glad ; as poor , but giving wealth to others ; as having nothing , but still having all things .
47006011	Our mouth is open to you , O Corinthians , our heart is wide .
47006012	It is not our feelings to you which are narrow , but yours to us .
47006013	Now to give me back payment of the same sort ( I am talking as to my children ) , let your hearts be wide open to me .
47006014	Do not keep company with those who have not faith : for what is there in common between righteousness and evil , or between light and dark ?
47006015	And what agreement is there between Christ and the Evil One ? or what part has one who has faith with one who has not ?
47006016	And what agreement has the house of God with images ? for we are a house of the living God ; even as God has said , I will be living among them , and walking with them ; and I will be their God , and they will be my people .
47006017	For which cause , Come out from among them , and be separate , says the Lord , and let no unclean thing come near you ; and I will take you for myself ,
47006018	And will be a Father to you ; and you will be my sons and daughters , says the Lord , the Ruler of all .
47007001	Because God , then , will give us such rewards , dear brothers , let us make ourselves clean from all evil of flesh and spirit , and become completely holy in the fear of God .
47007002	Let your hearts be open to us : we have done no man wrong , no man has been damaged by us , we have made no profit out of any man ,
47007003	It is not with the purpose of judging you that I say this : for I have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together .
47007004	My words to you are without fear , I am full of pride on account of you : I have great comfort and joy in all our troubles .
47007005	For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; there were fightings outside and fears inside .
47007006	But God who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of Titus ;
47007007	And not by his coming only , but by the comfort which he had in you , while he gave us word of your desire , your sorrow , your care for me ; so that I was still more glad .
47007008	For though my letter gave you pain , I have no regret for it now , though I had before ; for I see that the letter gave you pain , but only for a time .
47007009	Now I am glad , not that you had sorrow , but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart ; for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything .
47007010	For the sorrow which God gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart , in which there is no reason for grief : but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death .
47007011	For you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before God , what clearing of yourselves , what wrath against sin , what fear , what desire , what serious purpose , what punishment . In everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business .
47007012	So though I sent you a letter , it was not only because of the man who did the wrong , or because of him to whom the wrong was done , but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God .
47007013	So we have been comforted : and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus , for his spirit had been made glad by you all .
47007014	For I was not put to shame in anything in which I may have made clear to him my pride in you ; but as we said nothing to you but what was true , so the good things which I said to Titus about you were seen by him to be true .
47007015	And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all , how you gave way to his authority , and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour .
47007016	It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way .
47008001	And now we give you news , brothers , about the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia ;
47008002	How while they were undergoing every sort of trouble , and were in the greatest need , they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others .
47008003	For I give them witness , that as they were able , and even more than they were able , they gave from the impulse of their hearts ,
47008004	Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints :
47008005	And going even farther than our hope , they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God .
47008006	So that we made a request to Titus that , as he had made a start before , so he might make this grace complete in you .
47008007	And that as you are full of every good thing , of faith , of the word , of knowledge , of a ready mind , and of love to us , so you may be full of this grace in the same way .
47008008	I am not giving you an order , but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love .
47008009	For you see the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , how though he had wealth , he became poor on your account , so that through his need you might have wealth .
47008010	And in this I give my opinion : for it is to your profit , who were the first to make a start a year before , not only to do this , but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it .
47008011	Then make the doing of it complete ; so that as you had a ready mind , you may give effect to it as you are able .
47008012	For if there is a ready mind , a man will have God's approval in the measure of what he has , and not of what he has not .
47008013	And I am not saying this so that others may get off free , while the weight comes on you :
47008014	But so that things may be equal ; that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped , and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way , making things equal .
47008015	As it says in the Writings , He who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough .
47008016	But praise be to God , who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus .
47008017	For while he gladly gave ear to our request , he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart .
47008018	And with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches ;
47008019	And not only so , but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the Lord and to make clear that our mind was ready :
47008020	And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands :
47008021	For the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval , not only of the Lord , but of men .
47008022	And we have sent with them our brother , whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number , but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you .
47008023	If any question comes up about Titus , he is my brother-worker , working with me for you ; or about the others , they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of Christ .
47008024	Make clear then to them , as representatives of the churches , the quality of your love , and that the things which we have said about you are true .
47009001	But there is no need for me to say anything in my letter about the giving to the saints :
47009002	For I have before made clear to those of Macedonia my pride in your ready mind , saying to them that Achaia has been ready for a year back ; and a great number have been moved to do the same by your example .
47009003	But I have sent the brothers , so that the good things we said about you may be seen to be true , and that , as I said , you may be ready :
47009004	For fear that , if any from Macedonia come with me , and you are not ready , we ( not to say , you ) might be put to shame in this thing .
47009005	So it seemed to me wise for the brothers to go before , and see that the amount which you had undertaken to give was ready , so that it might be a cause for praise , and not as if we were making profit out of you .
47009006	But in the Writings it says , He who puts in only a small number of seeds , will get in the same ; and he who puts them in from a full hand , will have produce in full measure from them .
47009007	Let every man do after the purpose of his heart ; not giving with grief , or by force : for God takes pleasure in a ready giver .
47009008	And God is able to give you all grace in full measure ; so that ever having enough of all things , you may be full of every good work :
47009009	As it is said in the Writings , He has sent out far and wide , he has given to the poor ; his righteousness is for ever .
47009010	And he who gives seed for putting into the field and bread for food , will take care of the growth of your seed , at the same time increasing the fruits of your righteousness ;
47009011	Your wealth being increased in everything , with a simple mind , causing praise to God through us .
47009012	For this work of giving not only takes care of the needs of the saints , but is the cause of much praise to God ;
47009013	For when , through this work of giving , they see what you are , they give glory to God for the way in which you have given yourselves to the good news of Christ , and for the wealth of your giving to them and to all ;
47009014	While their hearts go out to you in love and in prayer for you , because of the great grace of God which is in you .
47009015	Praise be to God for what he has given , which words have no power to say .
47010001	Now I , Paul , myself make request to you by the quiet and gentle behaviour of Christ , I who am poor in spirit when with you , but who say what is in my mind to you without fear when I am away from you :
47010002	Yes , I make my request to you , so that when I am with you I may not have to make use of the authority which may be needed against some to whom we seem to be walking after the flesh .
47010003	For though we may be living in the flesh , we are not fighting after the way of the flesh
47010004	( For the arms with which we are fighting are not those of the flesh , but are strong before God for the destruction of high places ) ;
47010005	Putting an end to reasonings , and every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of God , and causing every thought to come under the authority of Christ ;
47010006	Being ready to give punishment to whatever is against his authority , after you have made it clear that you are completely under his control .
47010007	Give attention to the things which are before you . If any man seems to himself to be Christ's , let him keep in mind that we are as much Christ's as he is .
47010008	For though I might take pride in our authority ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for your destruction ) , it will not be a cause of shame to me :
47010009	That I may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters .
47010010	For his letters , they say , have weight and are strong ; but in body he is feeble , and his way of talking has little force .
47010011	Let those who say this keep in mind that , what we are in word by letters when we are away , so will we be in act when we are present .
47010012	For we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves : but these , measuring themselves by themselves , and making comparison of themselves with themselves , are not wise .
47010013	We will not give glory to ourselves in over-great measure , but after the measure of the rule which God has given us , a measure which comes even to you .
47010014	For we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are , as if our authority did not come as far as to you : for we came even as far as you with the good news of Christ :
47010015	Not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business , that is , for the work of others ; but having hope that , with the growth of your faith , we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work ,
47010016	So that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are , and not take credit for another man's work in making things ready to our hand .
47010017	But whoever has a desire for glory , let his glory be in the Lord .
47010018	For the Lord's approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself , but on the Lord's opinion of him .
47011001	Put up with me if I am a little foolish : but , truly , you do put up with me .
47011002	For I have a very great care for you : because you have been married by me to one husband , and it is my desire to give you completely holy to Christ .
47011003	But I have a fear , that in some way , as Eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake , your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for Christ .
47011004	For if anyone comes preaching another Jesus from the one whose preachers we are , or if you have got a different spirit , or a different sort of good news from those which came to you , how well you put up with these things .
47011005	For in my opinion , I am in no way less than the most important of the Apostles .
47011006	But though I am rough in my way of talking , I am not so in knowledge , as we have made clear to all by our acts among you .
47011007	Or did I do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up , because I gave you the good news of God without reward ?
47011008	I took money from other churches as payment for my work , so that I might be your servant ;
47011009	And when I was present with you , and was in need , I let no man be responsible for me ; for the brothers , when they came from Macedonia , gave me whatever was needed ; and in everything I kept myself from being a trouble to you , and I will go on doing so .
47011010	As the true word of Christ is in me , I will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of Achaia .
47011011	Why ? because I have no love for you ? let God be judge .
47011012	But what I do , that I will go on doing , so that I may give no chance to those who are looking for one ; so that , in the cause of their pride , they may be seen to be the same as we are .
47011013	For such men are false Apostles , workers of deceit , making themselves seem like Apostles of Christ .
47011014	And it is no wonder ; for even Satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light .
47011015	So it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness ; whose end will be the reward of their works .
47011016	I say again , Let me not seem foolish to anyone ; but if I do , put up with me as such , so that I may take a little glory to myself .
47011017	What I am now saying is not by the order of the Lord , but as a foolish person , taking credit to myself , as it seems .
47011018	Seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh , I will do the same .
47011019	For you put up with the foolish gladly , being wise yourselves .
47011020	You put up with a man if he makes servants of you , if he makes profit out of you , if he makes you prisoners , if he puts himself in a high place , if he gives you blows on the face .
47011021	I say this by way of shaming ourselves , as if we had been feeble . But if anyone puts himself forward ( I am talking like a foolish person ) , I will do the same .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? so am I . Are they of Israel ? so am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? ( I am talking foolishly ) I am more so ; I have had more experience of hard work , of prisons , of blows more than measure , of death .
47011024	Five times the Jews gave me forty blows but one .
47011025	Three times I was whipped with rods , once I was stoned , three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea , a night and a day I have been in the water ;
47011026	In frequent travels , in dangers on rivers , in dangers from outlaws , in dangers from my countrymen , in dangers from the Gentiles , in dangers in the town , in dangers in the waste land , in dangers at sea , in dangers among false brothers ;
47011027	In hard work and weariness , in frequent watchings , going without food and drink , cold and in need of clothing .
47011028	In addition to all the other things , there is that which comes on me every day , the care of all the churches .
47011029	Who is feeble and I am not feeble ? who is in danger of falling , and I am not angry ?
47011030	If I have to take credit to myself , I will do so in the things in which I am feeble .
47011031	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , to whom be praise for ever , is witness that the things which I say are true .
47011032	In Damascus , the ruler under Aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of Damascus , in order to take me :
47011033	And being let down in a basket from the wall through a window , I got free from his hands .
47012001	As it is necessary for me to take glory to myself , though it is not a good thing , I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
47012002	I have knowledge of a man in Christ , fourteen years back ( if he was in the body , or out of the body , I am not able to say , but God only ) , who was taken up to the third heaven .
47012003	And I have knowledge of such a man ( if he was in the body , or out of the body , I am not able to say , but God only ) ,
47012004	How he was taken up into Paradise , and words came to his ears which may not be said , and which man is not able to say .
47012005	On account of such a one I will have glory : for myself I will take no glory , but only in my feeble body .
47012006	For if I had a desire to take credit to myself , it would not be foolish , for I would be saying what is true : but I will not , for fear that I might seem to any man more than he sees me to be , or has word from me that I am .
47012007	And because the revelations were so very great , in order that I might not be overmuch lifted up , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , one sent from Satan to give me pain .
47012008	And about this thing I made request to the Lord three times that it might be taken away from me .
47012009	And he said to me , My grace is enough for you , for my power is made complete in what is feeble . Most gladly , then , will I take pride in my feeble body , so that the power of Christ may be on me .
47012010	So I take pleasure in being feeble , in unkind words , in needs , in cruel attacks , in troubles , on account of Christ : for when I am feeble , then am I strong .
47012011	I have been forced by you to become foolish , though it was right for my praise to have come from you : for in no way was I less than the chief of the Apostles , though I am nothing .
47012012	Truly the signs of an Apostle were done among you in quiet strength , with wonders and acts of power .
47012013	For what is there in which you were made less than the other churches , but in the one thing that I was not a trouble to you ? Let me have forgiveness for this wrong .
47012014	This is now the third time that I am ready to come to you ; and I will not be a trouble to you : my desire is for you , not for your property : for it is not the children's business to make store for their fathers , but the fathers for the children .
47012015	And I will gladly give all I have for your souls . If I have the more love for you , am I to be loved the less ?
47012016	But let it be so , that I was not a trouble to you myself ; but ( someone may say ) being false , I took you with deceit .
47012017	Did I make a profit out of you by any of those whom I sent to you ?
47012018	I gave orders to Titus , and I sent the brother with him . Did Titus make any profit out of you ? were we not guided by the same Spirit , in the same ways ?
47012019	It may seem to you that all this time we have been attempting to put ourselves in the right ; but we are saying these things before God in Christ . For all things , dear brothers , are for your profit .
47012020	For I have a fear that , when I come , you may not be answering to my desire , and that I may not be answering to yours ; that there may be fighting , hate , angry feeling , divisions , evil talk about others , secrets , thoughts of pride , outbursts against authority ;
47012021	And that when I come again , my God may put me to shame among you , and I may have grief for those who have done wrong before and have had no regret for their unclean ways , and for the evil desires of the flesh to which they have given way .
47013001	This is the third time that I am coming to you . From the mouth of two or three witnesses will every word be made certain .
47013002	I said before , and still say it before I come , as being present for the second time , though I am still away from you , to those who have done wrong before , and to all the others , that if I come again I will not have pity ;
47013003	Seeing that you are looking for a sign of Christ giving out his word in me ; who is not feeble in relation to you , but is strong in you :
47013004	For he was feeble in that he was put to death on the cross , but he is living by the power of God . And we are feeble in him , but we will be living with him through the power of God in relation to you .
47013005	Make a test of yourselves , if you are in the faith ; make certain of yourselves . Or are you not conscious in yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you , if you are truly Christ's ?
47013006	But it is my hope that you will have no doubt that we are truly Christ's .
47013007	Now our prayer to God is that you may do no evil ; not in order that it may be put to our credit , but so that you may do what is right , whatever we may seem .
47013008	Because we are able to do nothing against what is true , but only for it .
47013009	For we are glad when we are feeble and you are strong : and this is our prayer , even that you may be made complete .
47013010	For this cause I am writing these things while I am away , so that there may be need for me , when I am present , to make use of sharp measures , by the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for destruction .
47013011	Let this be my last word , brothers ; be glad ; be complete ; be comforted ; be of the same mind ; be at peace with one another : and the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Give one another a holy kiss .
47013013	All the saints send their love to you .
47013014	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the harmony of the Holy Spirit , be with you all .
48001001	Paul , an Apostle ( not from men , and not through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who made him come back from the dead ) ,
48001002	And all the brothers who are with me , to the churches of Galatia :
48001003	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	Who gave himself for our sins , so that he might make us free from this present evil world , after the purpose of our God and Father :
48001005	To whom be the glory for ever and ever . So be it .
48001006	I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ , to good news of a different sort ;
48001007	Which is not another sort : only there are some who give you trouble , desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ .
48001008	But even if we , or an angel from heaven , were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you , let there be a curse on him .
48001009	As we have said before , so say I now again , If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you , let there be a curse on him .
48001010	Am I now using arguments to men , or God ? or is it my desire to give men pleasure ? if I was still pleasing men , I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	Because I say to you , my brothers , that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's .
48001012	For I did not get it from man , and I was not given teaching in it , but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ .
48001013	For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews ' religion , how I was cruel without measure to the church of God , and did great damage to it :
48001014	And I went farther in the Jews ' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen , having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers .
48001015	But when it was the good pleasure of God , by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body , through his grace ,
48001016	To give the revelation of his Son in me , so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles ; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood ,
48001017	And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me ; but I went away into Arabia , and again I came back to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas , and was there with him fifteen days .
48001019	But of the other Apostles I saw only James , the Lord's brother .
48001020	Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true .
48001021	Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person :
48001023	Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him ;
48001024	And they gave glory to God in me .
48002001	Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus with me .
48002002	And I went up by revelation ; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles , but privately before those who were of good name , so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect .
48002003	But not even Titus who was with me , being a Greek , was made to undergo circumcision :
48002004	And that because of the false brothers let in secretly , who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus , so that they might make servants of us ;
48002005	To whom we gave way not even for an hour ; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you .
48002006	But from those who seemed to be important ( whatever they were has no weight with me : God does not take man's person into account ) : those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me ;
48002007	But , quite the opposite , when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision , even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision
48002008	( Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles ) ;
48002009	When they saw the grace which was given to me , James and Cephas and John , who had the name of being pillars , gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles , and they to the circumcision ;
48002010	Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor ; which very thing I had much in mind to do .
48002011	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I made a protest against him to his face , because he was clearly in the wrong .
48002012	For before certain men came from James , he did take food with the Gentiles : but when they came , he went back and made himself separate , fearing those who were of the circumcision .
48002013	And the rest of the Jews went after him , so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways .
48002014	But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news , I said to Cephas before them all , If you , being a Jew , are living like the Gentiles , and not like the Jews , how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews ?
48002015	We being Jews by birth , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
48002016	Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law , but through faith in Jesus Christ , we had faith in Christ Jesus , so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ , and not by the works of the law : because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness .
48002017	But if , while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ , we ourselves were seen to be sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? In no way !
48002018	For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction , I am seen to be a wrongdoer .
48002019	For I , through the law , have become dead to the law , so that I might be living to God .
48002020	I have been put to death on the cross with Christ ; still I am living ; no longer I , but Christ is living in me ; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith , the faith of the Son of God , who in love for me , gave himself up for me .
48002021	I do not make the grace of God of no effect : because if righteousness is through the law , then Christ was put to death for nothing .
48003001	O foolish Galatians , by what strange powers have you been tricked , to whom it was made clear that Jesus Christ was put to death on the cross ?
48003002	Give me an answer to this one question , Did the Spirit come to you through the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? having made a start in the Spirit , will you now be made complete in the flesh ?
48003004	Did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose ? if it is in fact to no purpose .
48003005	He who gives you the Spirit , and does works of power among you , is it by the works of law , or by the hearing of faith ?
48003006	Even as Abraham had faith in God , and it was put to his account as righteousness .
48003007	Be certain , then , that those who are of faith , the same are sons of Abraham .
48003008	And the holy Writings , seeing before the event that God would give the Gentiles righteousness by faith , gave the good news before to Abraham , saying , In you will all the nations have a blessing .
48003009	So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith .
48003010	For all who are of the works of the law are under a curse : because it is said in the Writings , A curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law .
48003011	Now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of God , is clear ; because , The upright will be living by faith .
48003012	And the law is not of faith ; but , He who does them will have life by them .
48003013	Christ has made us free from the curse of the law , having become a curse for us : because it is said in the Writings , A curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree :
48003014	So that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus ; in order that we through faith might have the Spirit which God had undertaken to give .
48003015	Brothers , as men would say , even a man's agreement , when it has been made certain , may not be put on one side , or have additions made to it .
48003016	Now to Abraham were the undertakings given , and to his seed . He says not , And to seeds , as of a great number ; but as of one , he says , And to your seed , which is Christ .
48003017	Now this I say : The law , which came four hundred and thirty years after , does not put an end to the agreement made before by God , so as to make the undertaking without effect .
48003018	Because if the heritage is by the law , it is no longer dependent on the word of God ; but God gave it to Abraham by his word .
48003019	What then is the law ? It was an addition made because of sin , till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given ; and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go-between .
48003020	Now a go-between is not a go-between of one ; but God is one .
48003021	Is the law then against the words of God ? in no way ; because if there had been a law which was able to give life , truly righteousness would have been by the law .
48003022	However , the holy Writings have put all things under sin , so that that for which God gave the undertaking , based on faith in Jesus Christ , might be given to those who have such faith .
48003023	But before faith came , we were kept in prison under the law , waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come .
48003024	So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ , so that we might have righteousness by faith .
48003025	But now that faith is come , we are no longer under a servant .
48003026	Because you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus .
48003027	For all those of you who were given baptism into Christ did put on Christ .
48003028	There is no Jew or Greek , servant or free , male or female : because you are all one in Jesus Christ .
48003029	And if you are Christ's , then you are Abraham's seed , and yours is the heritage by the right of God's undertaking given to Abraham .
48004001	But I say that as long as the son is a child , he is in no way different from a servant , though he is lord of all ;
48004002	But is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father .
48004003	So we , when we were young , were kept under the first rules of the world ;
48004004	But when the time had come , God sent out his Son , made of a woman , made under the law ,
48004005	That he might make them free who were under the law , and that we might be given the place of sons .
48004006	And because you are sons , God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , saying , Abba , Father .
48004007	So that you are no longer a servant , but a son ; and if a son , then the heritage of God is yours .
48004008	But at that time , having no knowledge of God , you were servants to those who by right are no gods :
48004009	But now that you have come to have knowledge of God , or more truly , God has knowledge of you , how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things , desiring to be servants to them again ?
48004010	You keep days , and months , and fixed times , and years .
48004011	I am in fear of you , that I may have been working for you to no purpose .
48004012	My desire for you , brothers , is that you may be as I am , because I am as you are . You have done me no wrong ;
48004013	But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time ;
48004014	And you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh , or put shame on it ; but you took me to your hearts as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
48004015	Where then is that happy condition of yours ? because I give you witness , that , if possible , you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me .
48004016	So then am I no longer your friend , because I give you true words ?
48004017	Their interest in you is not good ; but their desire is that you may be shut out , so that you may go after them .
48004018	But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times , and not only when I am present with you .
48004019	My children , of whom I am again in birth-pains till Christ is formed in you ,
48004020	Truly my desire is to be present with you now , using a changed voice ; for I am troubled about you .
48004021	Say , you whose desire it is to be under the law , do you not give ear to the law ?
48004022	Because it is in the Writings , that Abraham had two sons , one by the servant-woman , and one by the free woman .
48004023	Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh ; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God .
48004024	Which things have a secret sense ; because these women are the two agreements ; one from the mountain of Sinai , giving birth to servants , which is Hagar .
48004025	Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia , and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is : which is a servant with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem on high is free , which is our mother .
48004027	For it is in the Writings , You who have never given birth , be glad ; give cries of joy , you who have had no birth-pains ; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband .
48004028	Now we , brothers , as Isaac was , are the children of the undertaking of God .
48004029	But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit , even so it is now .
48004030	What then do the Writings say ? Send away the servant-woman and her son ; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman .
48004031	So , brothers , we are not children of the servant-woman , but of the free woman .
48005001	Christ has truly made us free : then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again .
48005002	See , I Paul say to you , that if you undergo circumcision , Christ will be of no use to you .
48005003	Yes , I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision , that he will have to keep all the law .
48005004	You are cut off from Christ , you who would have righteousness by the law ; you are turned away from grace .
48005005	For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness .
48005006	Because in Christ Jesus , having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit ; but only faith working through love .
48005007	You were going on well ; who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true ?
48005008	This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his .
48005009	A little leaven makes a change in all the mass .
48005010	I am certain about you in the Lord , that you will be of no other mind ; but he who is troubling you will have his punishment , whoever he is .
48005011	But I , brothers , if I am still preaching circumcision , why am I still attacked ? then has the shame of the cross been taken away .
48005012	My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves .
48005013	Because you , brothers , were marked out to be free ; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance , but through love be servants one to another .
48005014	For all the law is made complete in one word , even in this , Have love for your neighbour as for yourself .
48005015	But if you are given to fighting with one another , take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another .
48005016	But I say , Go on in the Spirit , and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh has desires against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; because these are opposite the one to the other ; so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do .
48005018	But if you are guided by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
48005019	Now the works of the flesh are clear , which are these : evil desire , unclean things , wrong use of the senses ,
48005020	Worship of images , use of strange powers , hates , fighting , desire for what another has , angry feelings , attempts to get the better of others , divisions , false teachings ,
48005021	Envy , uncontrolled drinking and feasting , and such things : of which I give you word clearly , even as I did in the past , that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , a quiet mind , kind acts , well-doing , faith ,
48005023	Gentle behaviour , control over desires : against such there is no law .
48005024	And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires .
48005025	If we are living by the Spirit , by the Spirit let us be guided .
48005026	Let us not be full of self-glory , making one another angry , having envy of one another .
48006001	Brothers , if a man is taken in any wrongdoing , you who are of the Spirit will put such a one right in a spirit of love ; keeping watch on yourself , for fear that you yourself may be tested .
48006002	Take on yourselves one another's troubles , and so keep the law of Christ .
48006003	For if a man has an idea that he is something when he is nothing , he is tricked by himself .
48006004	But let every man make test of his work , and then will his cause for glory be in himself only , and not in his neighbour .
48006005	Because every man is responsible for his part of the work .
48006006	But let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher .
48006007	Be not tricked ; God is not made sport of : for whatever seed a man puts in , that will he get back as grain .
48006008	Because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death ; but he who puts in the seed of the Spirit will of the Spirit get the reward of eternal life .
48006009	And let us not get tired of well-doing ; for at the right time we will get in the grain , if we do not give way to weariness .
48006010	So then , as we have the chance , let us do good to all men , and specially to those who are of the family of the faith .
48006011	See the size of the handwriting which I myself have made use of in writing to you .
48006012	Those who have the desire to seem important in the flesh , put force on you to undergo circumcision ; only that they may not be attacked because of the cross of Christ .
48006013	Because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law ; but they would have you undergo circumcision , so that they may have glory in your flesh .
48006014	But far be it from me to have glory in anything , but only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which this world has come to an end on the cross for me , and I for it .
48006015	For having circumcision is nothing , and not having circumcision is nothing , but only a new order of existence .
48006016	And on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy , and on the Israel of God .
48006017	From this time on let no man be a trouble to me ; because my body is marked with the marks of Jesus .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers . So be it .
49001001	Paul , an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the purpose of God , to the saints who are at Ephesus , and those who have faith in Christ Jesus :
49001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has given us every blessing of the Spirit in the heavens in Christ :
49001004	Even as he made selection of us in him from the first , so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love :
49001005	As we were designed before by him for the position of sons to himself , through Jesus Christ , in the good pleasure of his purpose ,
49001006	To the praise of the glory of his grace , which he freely gave to us in the Loved One :
49001007	In whom we have salvation through his blood , the forgiveness of our sins , through the wealth of his grace ,
49001008	Which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care ;
49001009	Having made clear to us the secret of his purpose , in agreement with the design which he had in mind , to put into his hands
49001010	The ordering of the times when they are complete , so that all things might come to a head in Christ , the things in heaven and the things on the earth ; in him , I say ,
49001011	In whom we have a heritage , being marked out from the first in his purpose who does all things in agreement with his designs ;
49001012	So that his glory might have praise through us who first had hope in Christ :
49001013	In whom you , having been given the true word , the good news of your salvation , and through your faith in him , were given the sign of the Holy Spirit of hope ,
49001014	Which is the first-fruit of our heritage , till God gets back that which is his , to the praise of his glory .
49001015	For this cause I , having had news of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you , and which you make clear to all the saints ,
49001016	Give praise without end for you , keeping you in mind in my prayers ;
49001017	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
49001018	And that having the eyes of your heart full of light , you may have knowledge of what is the hope of his purpose , what is the wealth of the glory of his heritage in the saints ,
49001019	And how unlimited is his power to us who have faith , as is seen in the working of the strength of his power ,
49001020	By which he made Christ come back from the dead , and gave him a place at his right hand in heaven ,
49001021	Far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named , not only in the present order , but in that which is to come :
49001022	And he has put all things under his feet , and has made him to be head over all things to the church ,
49001023	Which is his body , the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete .
49002001	And to you did he give life , when you were dead through your wrongdoing and sins ,
49002002	In which you were living in the past , after the ways of this present world , doing the pleasure of the lord of the power of the air , the spirit who is now working in those who go against the purpose of God ;
49002003	Among whom we all at one time were living in the pleasures of our flesh , giving way to the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and the punishment of God was waiting for us even as for the rest .
49002004	But God , being full of mercy , through the great love which he had for us ,
49002005	Even when we were dead through our sins , gave us life together with Christ ( by grace you have salvation ) ,
49002006	So that we came back from death with him , and are seated with him in the heavens , in Christ Jesus ;
49002007	That in the time to come he might make clear the full wealth of his grace in his mercy to us in Christ Jesus :
49002008	Because by grace you have salvation through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is given by God :
49002009	Not by works , so that no man may take glory to himself .
49002010	For by his act we were given existence in Christ Jesus to do those good works which God before made ready for us so that we might do them .
49002011	For this reason keep it in mind that in the past you , the Gentiles in the flesh , who are looked on as being outside the circumcision by those who have circumcision , in the flesh , made by hands ;
49002012	That you were at that time without Christ , being cut off from any part in Israel's rights as a nation , having no part in God's agreement , having no hope , and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who at one time were far off are made near in the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he is our peace , who has made the two into one , and by whom the middle wall of division has been broken down ,
49002015	Having in his flesh put an end to that which made the division between us , even the law with its rules and orders , so that he might make in himself , of the two , one new man , so making peace ;
49002016	And that the two might come into agreement with God in one body through the cross , so putting an end to that division .
49002017	And he came preaching peace to you who were far off , and to those who were near ;
49002018	Because through him the two of us are able to come near in one Spirit to the Father .
49002019	So then you are no longer as those who have no part or place in the kingdom of God , but you are numbered among the saints , and of the family of God ,
49002020	Resting on the base of the Apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the chief keystone ,
49002021	In whom all the building , rightly joined together , comes to be a holy house of God in the Lord ;
49002022	In whom you , with the rest , are united together as a living-place of God in the Spirit .
49003001	For this cause I Paul , the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles ,
49003002	If that ordering of the grace of God has come to your knowledge , which was given to me for you ,
49003003	How by revelation the secret was made clear to me , as I said before in a short letter ,
49003004	By the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of Christ ;
49003005	Which in other generations was not given to the sons of men , but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit ;
49003006	Which is that the Gentiles have a part in the heritage , and in the same body , and in the same hope in Christ through the good news ,
49003007	Of which I was made a preacher , through that grace of God which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power .
49003008	To me , who am less than the least of all the saints , was this grace given , so that I might make clear to the Gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of Christ :
49003009	And make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in God who made all things ;
49003010	So that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wide-shining wisdom of God ,
49003011	Which is seen in his eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord :
49003012	By whom we come near to God without fear through faith in him .
49003013	For this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you , which are your glory .
49003014	For this cause I go down on my knees before the Father ,
49003015	From whom every family in heaven and on earth is named ,
49003016	That in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his Spirit in your hearts ;
49003017	So that Christ may have his place in your hearts through faith ; and that you , being rooted and based in love ,
49003018	May have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is ,
49003019	And to have knowledge of the love of Christ which is outside all knowledge , so that you may be made complete as God himself is complete .
49003020	Now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts , through the power which is working in us ,
49003021	To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations for ever and ever . So be it .
49004001	I then , the prisoner in the Lord , make this request from my heart , that you will see that your behaviour is a credit to the position which God's purpose has given you ,
49004002	With all gentle and quiet behaviour , taking whatever comes , putting up with one another in love ;
49004003	Taking care to keep the harmony of the Spirit in the yoke of peace .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit , even as you have been marked out by God in the one hope of his purpose for you ;
49004005	One Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
49004006	One God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in all .
49004007	But to every one of us has grace been given in the measure of the giving of Christ .
49004008	For this reason he says , He went up on high , taking his prisoners with him , and gave freely to men .
49004009	( Now this , He went up , what is it but that he first went down into the lower parts of the earth ?
49004010	He who went down is the same who went up far over all the heavens so that he might make all things complete . )
49004011	And he gave some as Apostles , and some , prophets ; and some , preachers of the good news ; and some to give care and teaching ;
49004012	For the training of the saints as servants in the church , for the building up of the body of Christ :
49004013	Till we all come to the harmony of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to full growth , to the full measure of Christ :
49004014	So that we may be no longer children , sent this way and that , turned about by every wind of teaching , by the twisting and tricks of men , by the deceits of error ;
49004015	But saying true words in love , may come to full growth in him , who is the head , even Christ ;
49004016	Through whom all the body , being rightly formed and united together , by the full working of every part , is increased to the building up of itself in love .
49004017	This I say , then , and give witness in the Lord , that you are to go no longer in the way of the Gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit ,
49004018	Whose thoughts are dark , to whom the life of God is strange because they are without knowledge , and their hearts have been made hard ;
49004019	Who having no more power of feeling , have given themselves up to evil passions , to do all unclean things with overmuch desire .
49004020	For this was not the teaching of Christ which was given to you ;
49004021	If in fact you gave ear to him , and were given teaching in him , even as what is true is made clear in Jesus :
49004022	That you are to put away , in relation to your earlier way of life , the old man , which has become evil by love of deceit ;
49004023	And be made new in the spirit of your mind ,
49004024	And put on the new man , to which God has given life , in righteousness and a true and holy way of living .
49004025	And so , putting away false words , let everyone say what is true to his neighbour : for we are parts one of another .
49004026	Be angry without doing wrong ; let not the sun go down on your wrath ;
49004027	And do not give way to the Evil One .
49004028	Let him who was a thief be so no longer , but let him do good work with his hands , so that he may have something to give to him who is in need .
49004029	Let no evil talk come out of your mouth , but only what is good for giving necessary teaching , and for grace to those who give ear .
49004030	And do not give grief to the Holy Spirit of God , by whom you were marked for the day of salvation .
49004031	Let all bitter , sharp and angry feeling , and noise , and evil words , be put away from you , with all unkind acts ;
49004032	And be kind to one another , full of pity , having forgiveness for one another , even as God in Christ had forgiveness for you .
49005001	Let it then be your desire to be like God , as well-loved children ;
49005002	And be living in love , even as Christ had love for you , and gave himself up for us , an offering to God for a perfume of a sweet smell .
49005003	But evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things , or desire for others ' property , let it not even be named among you , as is right for saints ;
49005004	And let there be no low behaviour , or foolish talk , or words said in sport , which are not right , but in place of them the giving of praise .
49005005	Being certain of this , that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh , no unclean person , or one who has desire for the property of others , or who gives worship to images , has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and God .
49005006	Do not be turned from the right way by foolish words ; for because of these things the punishment of God comes on those who do not put themselves under him .
49005007	Have no part with such men ;
49005008	For you at one time were dark , but now are light in the Lord : let your behaviour be that of children of light
49005009	( Because the fruit of the light is in all righteousness and in everything which is good and true ) ,
49005010	Testing by experience what is well-pleasing to the Lord ;
49005011	And have no company with the works of the dark , which give no fruit , but make their true quality clear ;
49005012	For the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words .
49005013	But all things , when their true quality is seen , are made clear by the light : because everything which is made clear is light .
49005014	For this reason he says , Be awake , you who are sleeping , and come up from among the dead , and Christ will be your light .
49005015	Take care then how you are living , not as unwise , but as wise ;
49005016	Making good use of the time , because the days are evil .
49005017	For this reason , then , do not be foolish , but be conscious of the Lord's pleasure .
49005018	And do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome , but be full of the Spirit ;
49005019	Joining with one another in holy songs of praise and of the Spirit , using your voice in songs and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
49005020	Giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to God , even the Father ;
49005021	Letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of Christ .
49005022	Wives , be under the authority of your husbands , as of the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ is the head of the church , being himself the saviour of the body .
49005024	And as the church is under Christ's authority , so let wives be under the rule of their husbands in all things .
49005025	Husbands , have love for your wives , even as Christ had love for the church , and gave himself for it ;
49005026	So that he might make it holy , having made it clean with the washing of water by the word ,
49005027	And might take it for himself , a church full of glory , not having one mark or fold or any such thing ; but that it might be holy and complete .
49005028	Even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies . He who has love for his wife has love for himself :
49005029	For no man ever had hate for his flesh ; but he gives it food and takes care of it , even as Christ does for the church ;
49005030	Because we are parts of his body .
49005031	For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two will become one flesh .
49005032	This is a great secret : but my words are about Christ and the church .
49005033	But do you , everyone , have love for his wife , even as for himself ; and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband .
49006001	Children , do what is ordered by your fathers and mothers in the Lord : for this is right .
49006002	Give honour to your father and mother ( which is the first rule having a reward ) ,
49006003	So that all may be well for you , and your life may be long on the earth .
49006004	And , you fathers , do not make your children angry : but give them training in the teaching and fear of the Lord .
49006005	Servants , do what is ordered by those who are your natural masters , having respect and fear for them , with all your heart , as to Christ ;
49006006	Not only under your master's eye , as pleasers of men ; but as servants of Christ , doing the pleasure of God from the heart ;
49006007	Doing your work readily , as to the Lord , and not to men :
49006008	In the knowledge that for every good thing anyone does , he will have his reward from the Lord , If he is a servant or if he is free .
49006009	And , you masters , do the same things to them , not making use of violent words : in the knowledge that their Master and yours is in heaven , and he has no respect for a man's position .
49006010	Lastly , be strong in the Lord , and in the strength of his power .
49006011	Take up God's instruments of war , so that you may be able to keep your position against all the deceits of the Evil One .
49006012	For our fight is not against flesh and blood , but against authorities and powers , against the world-rulers of this dark night , against the spirits of evil in the heavens .
49006013	For this reason take up all the arms of God , so that you may be able to be strong in the evil day , and , having done all , to keep your place .
49006014	Take your place , then , having your body clothed with the true word , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ;
49006015	Be ready with the good news of peace as shoes on your feet ;
49006016	And most of all , using faith as a cover to keep off all the flaming arrows of the Evil One .
49006017	And take salvation for your head-dress and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God :
49006018	With prayers and deep desires , making requests at all times in the Spirit , and keeping watch , with strong purpose , in prayer for all the saints ,
49006019	And for me , that words may be given to me in the opening of my mouth , to make clear without fear the secret of the good news ,
49006020	For which I am a representative in chains , and that I may say without fear the things which it is right for me to say .
49006021	But so that you may have knowledge of my business , and how I am , Tychicus , the well-loved brother and tested servant in the Lord , will give you news of all things :
49006022	Whom I have sent to you for this very purpose , so that you may have knowledge of our position , and that he may give comfort to your hearts .
49006023	Peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	Grace be with all those who have true love for our Lord Jesus Christ .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi , with the Bishops and Deacons of the church :
50001002	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	I give praise to my God at every memory of you ,
50001004	And in all my prayers for you all , making my request with joy ,
50001005	Because of your help in giving the good news from the first day till now ;
50001006	For I am certain of this very thing , that he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till the day of Jesus Christ :
50001007	So it is right for me to take thought for you all in this way , because I have you in my heart ; for in my chains , and in my arguments before the judges in support of the good news , making clear that it is true , you all have your part with me in grace .
50001008	For God is my witness , how my love goes out to you all in the loving mercies of Christ Jesus .
50001009	And my prayer is that you may be increased more and more in knowledge and experience ;
50001010	So that you may give your approval to the best things ; that you may be true and without wrongdoing till the day of Christ ;
50001011	Being full of the fruits of righteousness , which are through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	Now it is my purpose to make clear to you , brothers , that the cause of the good news has been helped by my experiences ;
50001013	So that it became clear through all the Praetorium , and to all the rest , that I was a prisoner on account of Christ ;
50001014	And most of the brothers in the Lord , taking heart because of my chains , are all the stronger to give the word of God without fear .
50001015	Though some are preaching Christ out of envy and competition , others do it out of a good heart :
50001016	These do it from love , conscious that I am responsible for the cause of the good news :
50001017	But those are preaching Christ in a spirit of competition , not from their hearts , but with the purpose of giving me pain in my prison .
50001018	What then ? only that in every way , falsely or truly , the preaching of Christ goes on ; and in this I am glad , and will be glad .
50001019	For I am conscious that this will be for my salvation , through your prayer and the giving out of the stored wealth of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
50001020	In the measure of my strong hope and belief that in nothing will I be put to shame , but that without fear , as at all times , so now will Christ have glory in my body , by life or by death .
50001021	For to me life is Christ and death is profit .
50001022	But if I go on living in the flesh--if this is the fruit of my work--then I do not see what decision to make .
50001023	I am in a hard position between the two , having a desire to go away and be with Christ , which is very much better :
50001024	Still , to go on in the flesh is more necessary because of you .
50001025	And being certain of this , I am conscious that I will go on , yes , and go on with you all , for your growth and joy in the faith ;
50001026	So that your pride in me may be increased in Christ Jesus through my being present with you again .
50001027	Only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of Christ , so that if I come and see you or if I am away from you , I may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit , working together with one soul for the faith of the good news ;
50001028	Having no fear of those who are against you ; which is a clear sign of their destruction , but of your salvation , and that from God ;
50001029	Because to you it has been given in the cause of Christ not only to have faith in him , but to undergo pain on his account :
50001030	Fighting the same fight which you saw in me , and now have word of in me .
50002001	If then there is any comfort in Christ , any help given by love , any uniting of hearts in the Spirit , any loving mercies and pity ,
50002002	Make my joy complete by being of the same mind , having the same love , being in harmony and of one mind ;
50002003	Doing nothing through envy or through pride , but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself ;
50002004	Not looking everyone to his private good , but keeping in mind the things of others .
50002005	Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus ,
50002006	To whom , though himself in the form of God , it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God ;
50002007	But he made himself as nothing , taking the form of a servant , being made like men ;
50002008	And being seen in form as a man , he took the lowest place , and let himself be put to death , even the death of the cross .
50002009	For this reason God has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name ;
50002010	So that at the name of Jesus every knee may be bent , of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld ,
50002011	And that every tongue may give witness that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
50002012	So then , my loved ones , as you have at all times done what I say , not only when I am present , but now much more when I am not with you , give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts ;
50002013	For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts , for his good pleasure .
50002014	Do all things without protests and arguments ;
50002015	So that you may be holy and gentle , children of God without sin in a twisted and foolish generation , among whom you are seen as lights in the world ,
50002016	Offering the word of life ; so that I may have glory in you in the day of Christ , because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect .
50002017	And even if I am offered like a drink offering , giving myself for the cause and work of your faith , I am glad and have joy with you all :
50002018	And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy .
50002019	But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long , so that I may be comforted when I have news of you .
50002020	For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you .
50002021	For they all go after what is theirs , not after the things of Christ .
50002022	But his quality is clear to you ; how , as a child is to its father , so he was a help to me in the work of the good news .
50002023	Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible , when I am able to see how things will go for me :
50002024	But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long .
50002025	But it seemed to me necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight , and your servant , sent by you for help in my need ;
50002026	Because his heart was with you all , and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill :
50002027	For in fact he was ill almost to death : but God had mercy on him ; and not only on him but on me , so that I might not have grief on grief .
50002028	I have sent him , then , the more gladly , so that when you see him again , you may be happy and I may have the less sorrow .
50002029	So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy , and give honour to such as he is :
50002030	Because for the work of Christ he was near to death , putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete .
50003001	For the rest , my brothers , be glad in the Lord . Writing the same things to you is no trouble to me , and for you it is safe .
50003002	Be on the watch against dogs , against the workers of evil , against those of the circumcision :
50003003	For we are the circumcision , who give worship to God and have glory in Jesus Christ , and have no faith in the flesh :
50003004	Even though I myself might have faith in the flesh : if any other man has reason to have faith in the flesh , I have more :
50003005	Being given circumcision on the eighth day , of the nation of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; in relation to the law , a Pharisee :
50003006	In bitter hate I was cruel to the church ; I kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail .
50003007	But those things which were profit to me , I gave up for Christ .
50003008	Yes truly , and I am ready to give up all things for the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord , which is more than all : for whom I have undergone the loss of all things , and to me they are less than nothing , so that I may have Christ as my reward ,
50003009	And be seen in him , not having my righteousness which is of the law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith :
50003010	That I may have knowledge of him , and of the power of his coming back from the dead , and a part with him in his pains , becoming like him in his death ;
50003011	If in any way I may have the reward of life from the dead .
50003012	Not as if I had even now got the reward or been made complete : but I go on in the hope that I may come to the knowledge of that for which I was made the servant of Christ Jesus .
50003013	Brothers , it is clear to me that I have not come to that knowledge ; but one thing I do , letting go those things which are past , and stretching out to the things which are before ,
50003014	I go forward to the mark , even the reward of the high purpose of God in Christ Jesus .
50003015	Then let us all , who have come to full growth , be of this mind : and if in anything you are of a different mind , even this will God make clear to you :
50003016	Only , as far as we have got , let us be guided by the same rule .
50003017	Brothers , take me as your example , and take note of those who are walking after the example we have given .
50003018	For there are those , of whom I have given you word before , and do so now with sorrow , who are haters of the cross of Christ ;
50003019	Whose end is destruction , whose god is the stomach , and whose glory is in their shame , whose minds are fixed on the things of the earth .
50003020	For our country is in heaven ; from where the Saviour for whom we are waiting will come , even the Lord Jesus Christ :
50003021	By whom this poor body of ours will be changed into the image of the body of his glory , in the measure of the working by which he is able to put all things under himself .
50004001	So my brothers , well loved and very dear to me , my joy and crown , be strong in the Lord , my loved ones .
50004002	I make request to Euodias and Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord .
50004003	And I make request to you , true helper in my work , to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the good news , with Clement and the rest of my brother-workers whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Be glad in the Lord at all times : again I say , Be glad .
50004005	Let your gentle behaviour be clear to all men . The Lord is near .
50004006	Have no cares ; but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before God .
50004007	And the peace of God , which is deeper than all knowledge , will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	For the rest , my brothers , whatever things are true , whatever things have honour , whatever things are upright , whatever things are holy , whatever things are beautiful , whatever things are of value , if there is any virtue and if there is any praise , give thought to these things .
50004009	The things which came to you by my teaching and preaching , and which you saw in me , these things do , and the God of peace will be with you .
50004010	But I am very glad in the Lord that your care for me has come to life again ; though you did in fact take thought for me , but you were not able to give effect to it .
50004011	But I will not say anything about my needs , for I am able , wherever I am , to be dependent on myself .
50004012	It is the same to me if I am looked down on or honoured ; everywhere and in all things I have the secret of how to be full and how to go without food ; how to have wealth and how to be in need .
50004013	I am able to do all things through him who gives me strength .
50004014	But you did well to have care for me in my need .
50004015	And you have knowledge , Philippians , that when the good news first came to you , when I went away from Macedonia , no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints , but you only ;
50004016	Because even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to me in my need .
50004017	Not that I am looking for an offering , but for fruit which may be put to your credit .
50004018	I have all things and more than enough : I am made full , having had from Epaphroditus the things which came from you , a perfume of a sweet smell , an offering well pleasing to God .
50004019	And my God will give you all you have need of from the wealth of his glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	Now to God our Father be glory for ever and ever . So be it .
50004021	Give words of love to every saint in Christ Jesus . The brothers who are with me send you their love .
50004022	All the saints send their love to you , specially those who are of Caesar's house .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
51001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ , by the purpose of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	To the saints and true brothers in Christ at Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God our Father .
51001003	We give praise to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , making prayer for you at all times ,
51001004	After hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have for all the saints ,
51001005	Through the hope which is in store for you in heaven ; knowledge of which was given to you before in the true word of the good news ,
51001006	Which has come to you ; and which in all the world is giving fruit and increase , as it has done in you from the day when it came to your ears and you had true knowledge of the grace of God ;
51001007	As it was given to you by Epaphras , our well-loved helper , who is a true servant of Christ for us ,
51001008	And who , himself , made clear to us your love in the Spirit .
51001009	For this reason , we , from the day when we had word of it , keep on in prayer for you , that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose , with all wisdom and experience of the Spirit ,
51001010	Living uprightly in the approval of the Lord , giving fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
51001011	Full of strength in the measure of the great power of his glory , so that you may undergo all troubles with joy ;
51001012	Giving praise to the Father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light ;
51001013	Who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the Son of his love ;
51001014	In whom we have our salvation , the forgiveness of sins :
51001015	Who is the image of the unseen God coming into existence before all living things ;
51001016	For by him all things were made , in heaven and on earth , things seen and things unseen , authorities , lords , rulers , and powers ; all things were made by him and for him ;
51001017	He is before all things , and in him all things have being .
51001018	And he is the head of the body , the church : the starting point of all things , the first to come again from the dead ; so that in all things he might have the chief place .
51001019	For God in full measure was pleased to be in him ;
51001020	Through him uniting all things with himself , having made peace through the blood of his cross ; through him , I say , uniting all things which are on earth or in heaven .
51001021	And you , who in the past were cut off and at war with God in your minds through evil works , he has now made one
51001022	In the body of his flesh through death , so that you might be holy and without sin and free from all evil before him :
51001023	If you keep yourselves safely based in the faith , not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you , and which was given to every living being under heaven ; of which I , Paul , was made a servant .
51001024	Now I have joy in my pain because of you , and in my flesh I undergo whatever is still needed to make the sorrows of Christ complete , for the salvation of his body , the church ;
51001025	Of which I became a servant by the purpose of God which was given to me for you , to give effect to the word of God ,
51001026	The secret which has been kept from all times and generations , but has now been made clear to his saints ,
51001027	To whom God was pleased to give knowledge of the wealth of the glory of this secret among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
51001028	Whom we are preaching ; guiding and teaching every man in all wisdom , so that every man may be complete in Christ ;
51001029	And for this purpose I am working , using all my strength by the help of his power which is working in me strongly .
51002001	For it is my desire to give you news of the great fight I am making for you and for those at Laodicea , and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh ;
51002002	So that their hearts may be comforted , and that being joined together in love , they may come to the full wealth of the certain knowledge of the secret of God , even Christ ,
51002003	In whom are all the secret stores of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	I say this so that you may not be turned away by any deceit of words .
51002005	For though I am not present in the flesh , still I am with you in the spirit , seeing with joy your order , and your unchanging faith in Christ .
51002006	As , then , you took Christ Jesus the Lord , so go on in him ,
51002007	Rooted and based together in him , strong in the faith which the teaching gave you , giving praise to God at all times .
51002008	Take care that no one takes you away by force , through man's wisdom and deceit , going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world , and not after Christ :
51002009	For in him all the wealth of God's being has a living form ,
51002010	And you are complete in him , who is the head of all rule and authority :
51002011	In whom you had a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ;
51002012	Having been put to death with him in baptism , by which you came to life again with him , through faith in the working of God , who made him come back from the dead .
51002013	And you , being dead through your sins and the evil condition of your flesh , to you , I say , he gave life together with him , and forgiveness of all our sins ;
51002014	Having put an end to the handwriting of the law which was against us , taking it out of the way by nailing it to his cross ;
51002015	Having made himself free from the rule of authorities and powers , he put them openly to shame , glorying over them in it .
51002016	For this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or Sabbaths :
51002017	For these are an image of the things which are to come ; but the body is Christ's .
51002018	Let no man take your reward from you by consciously making little of himself and giving worship to angels ; having his thoughts fixed on the things which he has seen , being foolishly lifted up in his natural mind ,
51002019	And not joined to the Head , from whom all the body , being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands , has its growth with the increase of God .
51002020	If you were made free , by your death with Christ , from the rules of the world , why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders
51002021	Which say there may be no touching , tasting , or taking in your hands ,
51002022	( Rules which are all to come to an end with their use ) after the orders and teaching of men ?
51002023	These things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self-ordered worship and making little of oneself , and being cruel to the body , not honouring it by giving it its natural use .
51003001	If then you have a new life with Christ , give your attention to the things of heaven , where Christ is seated at the right hand of God .
51003002	Keep your mind on the higher things , not on the things of earth .
51003003	For your life on earth is done , and you have a secret life with Christ in God .
51003004	At the coming of Christ who is our life , you will be seen with him in glory .
51003005	Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth ; wrong use of the flesh , unclean things , passion , evil desires and envy , which is the worship of strange gods ;
51003006	Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders ;
51003007	Among whom you were living in the past , when you did such things .
51003008	But now it is right for you to put away all these things ; wrath , passion , bad feeling , curses , unclean talk ;
51003009	Do not make false statements to one another ; because you have put away the old man with all his doings ,
51003010	And have put on the new man , which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker ;
51003011	Where there is no Greek or Jew , no one with circumcision or without circumcision , no division between nations , no servant or free man : but Christ is all and in all .
51003012	As saints of God , then , holy and dearly loved , let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy , kind feeling , a low opinion of yourselves , gentle ways , and a power of undergoing all things ;
51003013	Being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another , if anyone has done wrong to his brother , even as the Lord had forgiveness for you :
51003014	And more than all , have love ; the only way in which you may be completely joined together .
51003015	And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts , as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body ; and give praise to God at all times .
51003016	Let the word of Christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom ; teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words , making melody to God with grace in your hearts .
51003017	And whatever you do , in word or in act , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving praise to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , be under the authority of your husbands , as is right in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , have love for your wives , and be not bitter against them .
51003020	Children , do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things , for this is pleasing to the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not be hard on your children , so that their spirit may not be broken .
51003022	Servants , in all things do the orders of your natural masters ; not only when their eyes are on you , as pleasers of men , but with all your heart , fearing the Lord :
51003023	Whatever you do , do it readily , as to the Lord and not to men ;
51003024	Being certain that the Lord will give you the reward of the heritage : for you are the servants of the Lord Christ .
51003025	For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done , without respect for any man's position .
51004001	Masters , give your servants what is right and equal , conscious that you have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Give yourselves to prayer at all times , keeping watch with praise ;
51004003	And making prayer for us , that God may give us an open door for the preaching of the word , the secret of Christ , for which I am now in chains ;
51004004	So that I may make it clear , as it is right for me to do .
51004005	Be wise in your behaviour to those who are outside , making good use of the time .
51004006	Let your talk be with grace , mixed with salt , so that you may be able to give an answer to everyone .
51004007	Tychicus will give you news of all my business : he is a dear brother and true servant and helper in the word ;
51004008	And I have sent him to you for this very purpose , so that you may have news of how we are , and so that he may give your hearts comfort ;
51004009	And with him I have sent Onesimus , the true and well-loved brother , who is one of you . They will give you word of everything which is taking place here .
51004010	Aristarchus , my brother-prisoner , sends his love to you , and Mark , a relation of Barnabas ( about whom you have been given orders : if he comes to you , be kind to him ) ,
51004011	And Jesus , whose other name is Justus ; these are of the circumcision : they are my only brother-workers for the kingdom of God , who have been a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ Jesus , sends you his love , ever taking thought for you in his prayers , that you may be complete and fully certain of all the purpose of God .
51004013	For I give witness of him that he has undergone much trouble for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis .
51004014	Luke , our well-loved medical friend , and Demas , send you their love .
51004015	Give my love to the brothers in Laodicea and to Nymphas and the church in their house .
51004016	And when this letter has been made public among you , let the same be done in the church of Laodicea ; and see that you have the letter from Laodicea .
51004017	Say to Archippus , See that you do the work which the Lord has given you to do .
51004018	I , Paul , give you this word of love in my handwriting . Keep in memory that I am a prisoner . Grace be with you .
52001001	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace .
52001002	We give praise to God at all times for you , keeping you in memory in our prayers ;
52001003	Having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father ;
52001004	Being conscious , my brothers , dear to God , that you have been marked out by God's purpose ;
52001005	Because our good news came to you , not in word only , but in power , and in the Holy Spirit , so that you were completely certain of it ; even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you .
52001006	And you took us and the Lord as your example , after the word had come to you in much trouble , with joy in the Holy Spirit ;
52001007	So that you became an example to all those who have faith in Christ in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	For not only was the word of the Lord sounding out from you in Macedonia and Achaia , but in every place your faith in God is made clear ; so that we have no need to say anything .
52001009	For they themselves give the news of how we came among you ; and how you were turned from images to God , to the worship of a true and living God ,
52001010	Waiting for his Son from heaven , who came back from the dead , even Jesus , our Saviour from the wrath to come .
52002001	For you yourselves , brothers , are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect :
52002002	But after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw , at Philippi , by the help of God we gave you the good news without fear , though everything was against us .
52002003	For our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit :
52002004	But even as the good news was given to us by the approval of God , so we give it out ; not as pleasing men , but God by whom our hearts are tested .
52002005	For it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smooth-sounding false words , and God is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves ,
52002006	Or looking for glory from men , from you or from others , when we might have made ourselves a care to you as Apostles of Christ .
52002007	But we were gentle among you , like a woman caring for her little ones :
52002008	Even so , being full of loving desire for you , we took delight in giving you not only God's good news , but even our lives , because you were dear to us .
52002009	For you have the memory , my brothers , of our trouble and care ; how , working night and day , so that we might not be a trouble to any of you , we gave you the good news of God .
52002010	You are witnesses , with God , how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith ;
52002011	Even as you saw how , like a father with his children , we were teaching and comforting you all , and giving witness ,
52002012	So that your lives might be pleasing to God , who has given you a part in his kingdom and his glory .
52002013	And for this cause we still give praise to God , that , when the word came to your ears through us , you took it , not as the word of man , but , as it truly is , the word of God , which has living power in you who have faith .
52002014	For you , my brothers , took as your examples the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus ; because you underwent the same things from your countrymen as they did from the Jews ;
52002015	Who put to death the Lord Jesus and the prophets , violently driving us out ; who are unpleasing to God and against all men ;
52002016	Who , to make the measure of their sins complete , kept us from giving the word of salvation to the Gentiles : but the wrath of God is about to come on them in the fullest degree .
52002017	But we , my brothers , being away from you for a short time , in body but not in heart , had all the more desire to see your face ;
52002018	For which reason we made attempts to come to you , even I , Paul , once and again ; but Satan kept us from coming .
52002019	For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory ? Are not even you , before our Lord Jesus , at his coming ?
52002020	For you are our glory and our joy .
52003001	At last our desire to have news of you was so strong that , while we ourselves were waiting at Athens ,
52003002	We sent Timothy , our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ , to give you strength and comfort in your faith ;
52003003	So that no man might be moved by these troubles ; because you see that these things are part of God's purpose for us .
52003004	And when we were with you , we said to you that trouble was before us ; and so it came about , as you see .
52003005	For this reason , when I was no longer able to keep quiet , I sent to get news of your faith , fearing that you might be tested by the Evil One and that our work might come to nothing .
52003006	But now that Timothy has come to us from you , and has given us good news of your faith and love , and that you have happy memories of us , desiring greatly to see us , even as we do to see you ;
52003007	For this cause , brothers , in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith ;
52003008	For it is life to us if you keep your faith in the Lord unchanged .
52003009	For how great is the praise which we give to God for you , and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our God ;
52003010	Night and day requesting God again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete .
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus make a way for us to come to you ;
52003012	And the Lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men , even as our love to you ;
52003013	So that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints .
52004001	And last of all , the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the Lord Jesus , is this : that as we made clear to you what sort of behaviour is pleasing to God , as in fact you are doing now , so you will go on in these ways , but more and more .
52004002	Because you have in mind the orders we gave you through the Lord Jesus .
52004003	For the purpose of God for you is this : that you may be holy , and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh ;
52004004	So that every one of you may keep his body holy and in honour ;
52004005	Not in the passion of evil desires , like the Gentiles , who have no knowledge of God ;
52004006	And that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business : for the Lord is the judge in all these things , as we said to you before and gave witness .
52004007	Because it is God's purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy .
52004008	Whoever , then , goes against this word , goes against not man but God , who gives his Holy Spirit to you .
52004009	But about loving the brothers , there is no need for me to say anything to you in this letter : for you have the teaching of God that love for one another is right and necessary ;
52004010	And , truly , you are lovers of all the brothers in Macedonia ; but it is our desire that your love may be increased still more ;
52004011	And that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business , working with your hands as we gave you orders ;
52004012	That you may be respected by those who are outside , and may have need of nothing .
52004013	But it is our desire , brothers , that you may be certain about those who are sleeping ; so that you may have no need for sorrow , as others have who are without hope .
52004014	For if we have faith that Jesus underwent death and came back again , even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by God's power .
52004015	For this we say to you by the word of the Lord , that we who are still living at the coming of the Lord , will not go before those who are sleeping .
52004016	Because the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a word of authority , with the voice of the chief angel , with the sound of a horn : and the dead in Christ will come to life first ;
52004017	Then we who are still living will be taken up together with them into the clouds to see the Lord in the air : and so will we be for ever with the Lord .
52004018	So then , give comfort to one another with these words .
52005001	But about the times and their order , my brothers , there is no need for me to say anything to you .
52005002	For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .
52005003	When they say , There is peace and no danger , then sudden destruction will come on them , as birth-pains on a woman with child ; and they will not be able to get away from it .
52005004	But you , my brothers , are not in the dark , for that day to overtake you like a thief :
52005005	For you are all sons of light and of the day : we are not of the night or of the dark .
52005006	So then , let us not take our rest as the others do , but let us be self-controlled and awake .
52005007	For those who are sleeping do so in the night ; and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night ;
52005008	But let us , who are of the day , be serious , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and on our heads , the hope of salvation .
52005009	For God's purpose for us is not wrath , but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
52005010	Who was put to death for us , so that , awake or sleeping , we may have a part in his life .
52005011	So then , go on comforting and building up one another , as you have been doing .
52005012	But we make this request to you , my brothers : give attention to those who are working among you , who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you ;
52005013	And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .
52005014	And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered , giving comfort to the feeble-hearted , supporting those with little strength , and putting up with much from all .
52005015	Let no one give evil for evil ; but ever go after what is good , for one another and for all .
52005016	Have joy at all times .
52005017	Keep on with your prayers .
52005018	In everything give praise : for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you .
52005019	Do not put out the light of the Spirit ;
52005020	Do not make little of the words of the prophets ;
52005021	Let all things be tested ; keep to what is good ;
52005022	Keep from every form of evil .
52005023	And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way ; and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	God , by whom you have been marked out in his purpose , is unchanging and will make it complete .
52005025	Brothers , keep us in mind in your prayers .
52005026	Give all the brothers a holy kiss .
52005027	I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy , to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	It is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you , brothers , because of the great increase of your faith , and the wealth of your love for one another ;
53001004	So that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of God for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through ;
53001005	Which is a clear sign of the decision which God in his righteousness has made ; to give you a part in his kingdom , for which you have undergone this pain ;
53001006	For it is an act of righteousness on God's part to give trouble as their reward to those who are troubling you ,
53001007	And to you who are troubled , rest with us , when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with the angels of his power in flames of fire ,
53001008	To give punishment to those who have no knowledge of God , and to those who do not give ear to the good news of our Lord Jesus :
53001009	Whose reward will be eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his strength ,
53001010	At his coming , when he will have glory in his saints , and will be a cause of wonder in all those who had faith ( because our witness among you had effect ) in that day .
53001011	For this reason , you are ever in our prayers , that you may seem to our God such as may have a part in his purpose and that by his power he will make all his good purpose , and the work of faith , complete ;
53001012	So that glory may be given to the name of our Lord Jesus through you , and you may have glory in him , by the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Now as to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ , and our meeting with him , it is our desire , my brothers ,
53002002	That you may not be moved in mind or troubled by a spirit , or by a word , or by a letter as from us , with the suggestion that the day of the Lord is even now come ;
53002003	Give no belief to false words : because there will first be a falling away from the faith , and the revelation of the man of sin , the son of destruction ,
53002004	Who puts himself against all authority , lifting himself up over all which is named God or is given worship ; so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God , putting himself forward as God .
53002005	Have you no memory of what I said when I was with you , giving you word of these things ?
53002006	And now it is clear to you what is keeping back his revelation till the time comes for him to be seen .
53002007	For the secret of evil is even now at work : but there is one who is keeping back the evil till he is taken out of the way .
53002008	And then will come the revelation of that evil one , whom the Lord Jesus will put to death with the breath of his mouth , and give to destruction by the revelation of his coming ;
53002009	Even the one whose coming is marked by the working of Satan , with all power and signs and false wonders ,
53002010	And with every deceit of wrongdoing among those whose fate is destruction ; because they were quite without that love of the true faith by which they might have salvation .
53002011	And for this cause , God will give them up to the power of deceit and they will put their faith in what is false :
53002012	So that they all may be judged , who had no faith in what is true , but took pleasure in evil .
53002013	But it is right for us to give praise to God at all times for you , brothers , loved by the Lord , because it was the purpose of God from the first that you might have salvation , being made holy by the Spirit and by faith in what is true :
53002014	And in this purpose he gave you a part through the good news of which we were the preachers , even that you might have part in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So then , brothers , be strong in purpose , and keep the teaching which has been given to you by word or by letter from us .
53002016	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God our Father who had love for us and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace ,
53002017	Give you comfort and strength in every good work and word .
53003001	For the rest , my brothers , let there be prayer for us that the word of the Lord may go forward with increasing glory , even as it does with you ;
53003002	And that we may be made free from foolish and evil men ; for not all have faith .
53003003	But the Lord is true , who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil .
53003004	And we have faith in the Lord about you , that you are doing and will do the things about which we give you orders .
53003005	And may your hearts be guided by the Lord into the love of God and quiet waiting for Christ .
53003006	Now we give you orders , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us .
53003007	For you yourselves are used to taking us as your example , because our life among you was ruled by order ,
53003008	And we did not take food from any man for nothing , but were working hard night and day not to be a trouble to any of you :
53003009	Not because we have not the right , but to make ourselves an example to you , so that you might do the same .
53003010	For even when we were with you we gave you orders , saying , If any man does no work , let him not have food .
53003011	For it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behaviour is uncontrolled , who do no work at all , but are over-interested in the business of others .
53003012	Now to such we give orders and make request in the Lord Jesus , that , working quietly , they get their living .
53003013	And you , my brothers , do not get tired of well-doing .
53003014	And if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter , take note of that man , and keep away from him , so that he may be shamed .
53003015	Have no feeling of hate for him , but take him in hand seriously as a brother .
53003016	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way . May the Lord be with you all .
53003017	These words of love to you at the end are in my writing , Paul's writing , and this is the mark of every letter from me .
53003018	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ , by the order of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope ;
54001002	To Timothy , my true child in the faith : Grace , mercy , peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	It was my desire , when I went on into Macedonia , that you might make a stop at Ephesus , to give orders to certain men not to put forward a different teaching ,
54001004	Or to give attention to stories and long lists of generations , from which come questionings and doubts , in place of God's ordered way of life which is in faith ;
54001005	But the effect of the order is love coming from a clean heart , and a knowledge of what is right , and true faith :
54001006	From which some have been turned away , giving themselves to foolish talking ;
54001007	Desiring to be teachers of the law , though they have no knowledge of what they say or of the statements which they make so certainly .
54001008	We are conscious that the law is good , if a man makes a right use of it ,
54001009	With the knowledge that the law is made , not for the upright man , but for those who have no respect for law and order , for evil men and sinners , for the unholy and those who have no religion , for those who put their fathers or mothers to death , for takers of life ,
54001010	For those who go after loose women , for those with unnatural desires , for those who take men prisoners , who make false statements and false oaths , and those who do any other things against the right teaching ,
54001011	Which may be seen in the good news of the glory of the great God , which was given into my care .
54001012	I give praise to him who gave me power , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he took me to be true , making me his servant ,
54001013	Though I had said violent words against God , and done cruel acts , causing great trouble : but I was given mercy , because I did it without knowledge , not having faith ;
54001014	And the grace of our Lord was very great , with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
54001015	It is a true saying , in which all may put their faith , that Christ Jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners , of whom I am the chief :
54001016	But for this reason I was given mercy , so that in me , the chief of sinners , Jesus Christ might make clear all his mercy , as an example to those who in the future would have faith in him to eternal life .
54001017	Now to the King eternal , ever-living , unseen , the only God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . So be it .
54001018	This order I give to you , Timothy my son , in harmony with the words of the prophets about you , so that by them you may be strong , fighting the good fight ,
54001019	Keeping faith , and being conscious of well-doing ; for some , by not doing these things , have gone wrong in relation to the faith :
54001020	Such are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have given up to Satan , so that they may say no more evil words against God .
54002001	My desire is , first of all , that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men ;
54002002	For kings and all those in authority ; so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of God and serious behaviour .
54002003	This is good and pleasing in the eyes of God our Saviour ;
54002004	Whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true .
54002005	For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	Who gave himself as an offering for all ; witness of which was to be given at the right time ;
54002007	And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle ( what I say is true , not false , ) and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith .
54002008	It is my desire , then , that in every place men may give themselves to prayer , lifting up holy hands , without wrath or argument .
54002009	And that women may be dressed in simple clothing , with a quiet and serious air ; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price ;
54002010	But clothed with good works , as is right for women who are living in the fear of God .
54002011	Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority .
54002012	In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher , or to have rule over a man , but to be quiet .
54002013	For Adam was first formed , then Eve ;
54002014	And Adam was not taken by deceit , but the woman , being tricked , became a wrongdoer .
54002015	But if they go on in faith and love and holy self-control , she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth .
54003001	This is a true saying , A man desiring the position of a Bishop has a desire for a good work .
54003002	The Bishop , then , is to be a man of good name , the husband of one wife , self-controlled , serious-minded , having respect for order , opening his house freely to guests , a ready teacher ;
54003003	Not quickly moved to wrath or blows , but gentle ; no fighter , no lover of money ;
54003004	Ruling his house well , having his children under control with all serious behaviour ;
54003005	( For if a man has not the art of ruling his house , how will he take care of the church of God ? )
54003006	Not one newly taken into the church , for fear that , through his high opinion of himself , he may come into the same sin as the Evil One .
54003007	And he is to have a good name among those outside the church , so that nothing may be said against him and he may not be taken by the designs of the Evil One .
54003008	Deacons , in the same way , are to be serious in their behaviour , not false in word , not given to taking much wine or greatly desiring the wealth of this world ;
54003009	Keeping the secret of the faith in a heart free from sin .
54003010	And let these first be put to the test ; then let them become Deacons if there is nothing against them .
54003011	Women are to be serious in behaviour , saying no evil of others , controlling themselves , true in all things .
54003012	Let Deacons be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their houses well .
54003013	For those who have done good work as Deacons get for themselves a good position and become free from fear in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I am writing these things to you , though I am hoping to come to you before long ;
54003015	But if I am long in coming , this will make clear to you what behaviour is right for men in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and base of what is true .
54003016	And without argument , great is the secret of religion : He who was seen in the flesh , who was given God's approval in the spirit , was seen by the angels , of whom the good news was given among the nations , in whom the world had faith , who was taken up in glory .
54004001	But the Spirit says clearly that in later times some will be turned away from the faith , giving their minds to spirits of deceit , and the teachings of evil spirits ,
54004002	Through the false ways of men whose words are untrue , whose hearts are burned as with a heated iron ;
54004003	Who keep men from being married and from taking food which God made to be taken with praise by those who have faith and true knowledge .
54004004	Because everything which God has made is good , and nothing is evil , if it is taken with praise :
54004005	For it is made holy by the word of God and by prayer .
54004006	If you keep these things before the minds of the brothers , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , trained in the words of the faith and of the right teaching which has been your guide :
54004007	But have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories . Give yourself training in religion :
54004008	For the training of the body is of profit for a little , but religion is of profit in every way , giving hope for the life which now is , and for that which is to come .
54004009	This is a true saying , in which all may put their faith .
54004010	And this is the purpose of all our work and our fighting , because our hope is in the living God , who is the Saviour of all men , and specially of those who have faith .
54004011	Let these be your orders and your teaching .
54004012	Let no one make little of you because you are young , but be an example to the church in word , in behaviour , in love , in faith , in holy living .
54004013	Till I come , give attention to the reading of the holy Writings , to comforting the saints , and to teaching .
54004014	Make use of that grace in you , which was given to you by the word of the prophets , when the rulers of the church put their hands on you .
54004015	Have a care for these things ; give yourself to them with all your heart , so that all may see how you go forward .
54004016	Give attention to yourself and your teaching . Go on in these things ; for in doing so you will get salvation for yourself and for those who give hearing to you .
54005001	Do not say sharp words to one who has authority in the church , but let your talk be as to a father , and to the younger men as to brothers :
54005002	To the older women as to mothers , to the younger as to sisters , with a clean heart .
54005003	Give honour to widows who are truly widows .
54005004	But if any widow has children or children's children , let these see that it is right to take care of their family and their fathers and mothers : for this is pleasing in the eyes of God .
54005005	Now she who is truly a widow and without family puts her hope in God , giving herself to prayer day and night .
54005006	But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she is living .
54005007	Give orders to this effect , so that no evil may be said of anyone .
54005008	If anyone has no care for his family and those in his house , he is false to the faith , and is worse than one who has no faith .
54005009	Let no woman be numbered among the widows who is under sixty years old , and only if she has been the wife of one man ,
54005010	And if witness is given of her good works ; if she has had the care of children , if she has been kind to travellers , washing the feet of the saints , helping those who are in trouble , giving herself to good works .
54005011	But to the younger widows say No : for when their love is turned away from Christ , they have a desire to be married ;
54005012	And they are judged because they have been false to their first faith ;
54005013	And they get into the way of doing no work , going about from house to house ; and not only doing no work , but talking foolishly , being over-interested in the business of others , saying things which they have no right to say .
54005014	So it is my desire that the younger widows may be married and have children , controlling their families , and giving the Evil One no chance to say anything against them ,
54005015	For even now some are turned away to Satan .
54005016	If any woman of the faith has relations who are widows , let her give them help , so that the care of them does not come on the church , and so it may give help to those who are truly widowed .
54005017	Let rulers whose rule is good be honoured twice over , specially those whose work is preaching and teaching .
54005018	For the Writings say , It is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it . And , The worker has a right to his reward .
54005019	Do not take as true any statement made against one in authority , but only if two or three give witness to it .
54005020	Say sharp words to sinners when all are present , so that the rest may be in fear .
54005021	I give you orders before God and Christ Jesus and the angels of God's selection , to keep these orders without giving thought to one side more than another .
54005022	Do not put hands on any man without thought , and have no part in other men's sins : keep yourself clean .
54005023	Do not take only water as your drink , but take a little wine for the good of your stomach , and because you are frequently ill .
54005024	The sins of some men are clearly seen , going before them to be judged ; but with others , their sins go after them .
54005025	In the same way , there are good works which are clearly seen ; and those which are not so , may not be kept secret .
54006001	Let all who are servants under the yoke give all honour to their masters , so that no evil may be said against the name of God and his teaching .
54006002	And let those whose masters are of the faith have respect for them because they are brothers , working for them the more readily , because those who take part in the good work are of the faith and are dear . Give orders and teaching about these things .
54006003	If any man gives different teaching , not in agreement with the true words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and with the teaching which is in agreement with true religion ,
54006004	He has an over-high opinion of himself ; being without knowledge , having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words , from which come envy , fighting , cruel words , evil thoughts ,
54006005	Bitter talk of men who , being evil in mind and dead to what is true , take the faith to be a way of making profit .
54006006	But true faith , with peace of mind , is of great profit :
54006007	For we came into the world with nothing , and we are not able to take anything out ;
54006008	But if we have food and a roof over us , let that be enough .
54006009	But those who have a desire for wealth are falling into danger , and are taken as in a net by a number of foolish and damaging desires , through which men are overtaken by death and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all evil : and some whose hearts were fixed on it have been turned away from the faith , and been wounded with unnumbered sorrows .
54006011	But you , O man of God , keep yourself from these things , and go after righteousness , religion , faith , love , a quiet mind , gentle behaviour .
54006012	Be fighting the good fight of the faith ; take for yourself the life eternal , for which you were marked out , and of which you gave witness in the eyes of all .
54006013	I give you orders before God , the giver of life , and Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate gave witness to the faith ,
54006014	To keep the word untouched by evil , clear from all shame , till the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ :
54006015	Which at the right time he will make clear , who is the eternal and only Ruler , King of kings , and Lord of lords ;
54006016	Who only has life for ever , living in light to which no man may come near ; whom no man has seen or is able to see : to whom be honour and power for ever . So be it .
54006017	Give orders to those who have money and goods in this life , not to be lifted up in their minds , or to put their hope in the uncertain chances of wealth , but in God who gives us in full measure all things for our use ;
54006018	And to do good , having wealth in good works , being quick to give , taking part with one another ;
54006019	Making ready for themselves a safe place for the time to come , so that the true life may be theirs .
54006020	O Timothy , take good care of that which is given to you , turning away from the wrong and foolish talk and arguments of that knowledge which is falsely so named ;
54006021	Through which some , who gave their minds to it , have been turned away from the faith . Grace be with you .
55001001	Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God , in the hope of the life which is in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	To Timothy , my well-loved child : Grace , mercy , peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I give praise to God , whose servant I have been , with a heart free from sin , from the time of my fathers , because in my prayers at all times the thought of you is with me , night and day
55001004	Desiring to see you , keeping in my memory your weeping , so that I may be full of joy ;
55001005	Having in mind your true faith , which first was in your mother's mother Lois , and in your mother Eunice , and , I am certain , is now in you .
55001006	For this reason I say to you , Let that grace of God which is in you , given to you by my hands , have living power .
55001007	For God did not give us a spirit of fear , but of power and of love and of self-control .
55001008	Have no feeling of shame , then , for the witness of our Lord or for me , his prisoner : but undergo all things for the good news in the measure of the power of God ;
55001009	Who gave us salvation , marking us out for his purpose , not on account of our works , but in the measure of his purpose and his grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal ,
55001010	But has now been made clear by the revelation of our Saviour Christ Jesus , who put an end to death and made life unending come to light through the good news ,
55001011	Of which I was made a preacher and an Apostle and a teacher ;
55001012	And for which I undergo these things : but I have no feeling of shame . For I have knowledge of him in whom I have faith , and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have given into his care till that day .
55001013	Keep the form of those true words which you had from me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
55001014	That good thing which was given to you keep safe , through the Holy Spirit which is in us .
55001015	You have had news that all those in Asia went away from me ; among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes :
55001016	May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus because he frequently gave me help , and had no feeling of shame because I was in chains ;
55001017	But when he was in Rome , he went in search of me everywhere , and came to me
55001018	( May he have the Lord's mercy in that day ) ; and of all he did for me at Ephesus you have full knowledge .
55002001	So then , my child , be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus .
55002002	And the things which I have said to you before a number of witnesses , give to those of the faith , so that they may be teachers of others .
55002003	Be ready to do without the comforts of life , as one of the army of Christ Jesus .
55002004	A fighting man , when he is with the army , keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army .
55002005	And if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules .
55002006	It is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit .
55002007	Give thought to what I say ; for the Lord will give you wisdom in all things .
55002008	Keep in mind Jesus Christ , of the seed of David , who came back from the dead , as my good news gives witness :
55002009	In which I put up with the hardest conditions , even prison chains , like one who has done a crime ; but the word of God is not in chains .
55002010	But I undergo all things for the saints , so that they may have salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
55002011	This is a true saying : If we undergo death with him , then will we be living with him :
55002012	If we go on to the end , then we will be ruling with him : if we say we have no knowledge of him , then he will say he has no knowledge of us :
55002013	If we are without faith , still he keeps faith , for he will never be untrue to himself .
55002014	Put these things before them , giving them orders in the name of the Lord to keep themselves from fighting about words , which is of no profit , only causing error in their hearers .
55002015	Let it be your care to get the approval of God , as a workman who has no cause for shame , giving the true word in the right way .
55002016	But take no part in wrong and foolish talk , for those who do so will go farther into evil ,
55002017	And their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh : such are Hymenaeus and Philetus ;
55002018	Men whose ideas are all false , who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place , overturning the faith of some .
55002019	But God's strong base is unchanging , having this sign , The Lord has knowledge of those who are his : and , Let everyone by whom the name of the Lord is named be turned away from evil .
55002020	Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver , but others of wood and earth , and some which are honoured and some without honour .
55002021	If a man makes himself clean from these , he will be a vessel for honour , made holy , ready for the master's use , ready for every good work .
55002022	But keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young , and go after righteousness , faith , love , peace , with those whose prayers go up to the Lord from a clean heart .
55002023	And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings , seeing that they are a cause of trouble .
55002024	For it is not right for the Lord's servant to make trouble , but he is to be gentle to all , ready in teaching , putting up with wrong ,
55002025	Gently guiding those who go against the teaching ; if by chance God may give them a change of heart and true knowledge ,
55002026	And so they may get themselves free from the net of the Evil One , being made the prisoners of the Lord's servant , for the purpose of God .
55003001	But be certain of this , that in the last days times of trouble will come .
55003002	For men will be lovers of self , lovers of money , uplifted in pride , given to bitter words , going against the authority of their fathers , never giving praise , having no religion ,
55003003	Without natural love , bitter haters , saying evil of others , violent and uncontrolled , hating all good ,
55003004	False to their friends , acting without thought , lifted up in mind , loving pleasure more than God ;
55003005	Having a form of religion , but turning their backs on the power of it : go not with these .
55003006	For these are they who go secretly into houses , making prisoners of foolish women , weighted down with sin , turned from the way by their evil desires ,
55003007	Ever learning , and never coming to the knowledge of what is true .
55003008	And as James and Jambres went against Moses , so do these go against what is true : men of evil minds , who , tested by faith , are seen to be false .
55003009	But they will go no farther : for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men , as theirs was in the end .
55003010	But you took as your example my teaching , behaviour , purpose , and faith ; my long waiting , my love , my quiet undergoing of trouble ;
55003011	My punishments and pain ; the things which came to me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; the cruel attacks made on me : and the Lord made me free from them all .
55003012	Yes , and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus , will be cruelly attacked .
55003013	Evil and false men will become worse and worse , using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit .
55003014	But see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain , conscious of who has been your teacher ;
55003015	And that from the time when you were a child , you have had knowledge of the holy Writings , which are able to make you wise to salvation , through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	Every holy Writing which comes from God is of profit for teaching , for training , for guiding , for education in righteousness :
55003017	So that the man of God may be complete , trained and made ready for every good work .
55004001	I give you orders , before God and Christ Jesus , who will be the judge of the living and the dead , and by his revelation and his kingdom ;
55004002	Be preaching the word at all times , in every place ; make protests , say sharp words , give comfort , with long waiting and teaching ;
55004003	For the time will come when they will not take the true teaching ; but , moved by their desires , they will get for themselves a great number of teachers for the pleasure of hearing them ;
55004004	And shutting their ears to what is true , will be turned away to belief in foolish stories .
55004005	But be self-controlled in all things , do without comfort , go on preaching the good news , completing the work which has been given you to do .
55004006	For I am even now being offered , and my end is near .
55004007	I have made a good fight , I have come to the end of my journey , I have kept the faith :
55004008	From now on , the crown of righteousness is made ready for me , which the Lord , the upright judge , Will give to me at that day : and not only to me , but to all those who have had love for his revelation .
55004009	Do your best to come to me before long :
55004010	For Demas has gone away from me , for love of this present life , and has gone to Thessalonica : Crescens has gone to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and take him with you ; for he is of use to me in the work .
55004012	Tychicus I sent to Ephesus .
55004013	The coat which I did not take from Troas and which is with Carpus , get when you come , and the books , specially the papers .
55004014	Alexander the copper-worker did me much wrong : the Lord will give him the reward of his works :
55004015	But be on the watch for him , for he was violent in his attacks on our teaching .
55004016	At my first meeting with my judges , no one took my part , but all went away from me . May it not be put to their account .
55004017	But the Lord was by my side and gave me strength ; so that through me the news might be given out in full measure , and all the Gentiles might give ear : and I was taken out of the mouth of the lion .
55004018	The Lord will keep me safe from every evil work and will give me salvation in his kingdom in heaven : to whom be glory for ever and ever . So be it .
55004019	Give my love to Prisca and Aquila and those of the house of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus was stopping at Corinth ; but Trophimus , when I last saw him was at Miletus , ill .
55004021	Do your best to come before the winter . Eubulus sends you his love , and Pudens and Linus and Claudia , and all the brothers .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you .
56001001	Paul , a servant of God , and an Apostle of Jesus Christ , in agreement with the faith of the saints of God and the full knowledge of what is true in harmony with religion ,
56001002	In the hope of eternal life , which was made certain before eternal time , by the word of God who is ever true ;
56001003	Who , in his time , made clear his word in the good news , of which , by the order of God our Saviour , I became a preacher ;
56001004	To Titus , my true child in our common faith : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour .
56001005	I did not take you with me when I went away from Crete , so that you might do what was necessary to put things in order there , placing men in authority over the churches in every town , as I said to you ;
56001006	Men having a good record , husbands of one wife , whose children are of the faith , children of whom it may not be said that they are given to loose living or are uncontrolled .
56001007	For it is necessary for a Bishop to be a man of virtue , as God's servant ; not pushing himself forward , not quickly moved to wrath or blows , not desiring profit for himself ;
56001008	But opening his house freely to guests ; a lover of what is good , serious-minded , upright , holy , self-controlled ;
56001009	Keeping to the true word of the teaching , so that he may be able to give comfort by right teaching and overcome the arguments of the doubters .
56001010	For there are men who are not ruled by law ; foolish talkers , false teachers , specially those of the circumcision ,
56001011	By whom some families have been completely overturned ; who take money for teaching things which are not right ; these will have to be stopped .
56001012	One of their prophets has said , The men of Crete are ever false , evil beasts , lovers of food , hating work .
56001013	This witness is true . So say sharp words to them so that they may come to the right faith ,
56001014	Giving no attention to the fictions of the Jews and the rules of men who have no true knowledge .
56001015	To the clean in heart all things are clean : but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean ; they become unclean in mind and in thought .
56001016	They say that they have knowledge of God , while by their acts they are turning their backs on him ; they are hated by all , hard-hearted , and judged to be without value for any good work .
56002001	But let your words be in agreement with true and right teaching :
56002002	That old men are to be simple in their tastes , serious , wise , true in faith , in love , and of a quiet mind .
56002003	That old women are to be self-respecting in behaviour , not saying evil of others , not given to taking much wine , teachers of that which is good ,
56002004	Training the younger women to have love for their husbands and children ,
56002005	To be wise in mind , clean in heart , kind ; working in their houses , living under the authority of their husbands ; so that no evil may be said of the word of God .
56002006	To the young men give orders to be wise and serious-minded :
56002007	In all things see that you are an example of good works ; holy in your teaching , serious in behaviour ,
56002008	Saying true and right words , against which no protest may be made , so that he who is not on our side may be put to shame , unable to say any evil of us .
56002009	Servants are to be under the authority of their masters , pleasing them in all things , without argument ;
56002010	Not taking what is not theirs , but giving clear signs of their good faith , in all things doing credit to the teaching of God our Saviour .
56002011	For the grace of God has come , giving salvation to all men ,
56002012	Training us so that , turning away from evil and the desires of this world , we may be living wisely and uprightly in the knowledge of God in this present life ;
56002013	Looking for the glad hope , the revelation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ ;
56002014	Who gave himself for us , so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing , and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works .
56002015	On all these points give teaching and help , and make clear what is right with all authority . Let all men give you honour .
56003001	Make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities , to do what they are ordered , to be ready for every good work ,
56003002	To say no evil of any man , not to be fighters , to give way to others , to be gentle in behaviour to all men .
56003003	For in the past we were foolish , hard in heart , turned from the true way , servants of evil desires and pleasures , living in bad feeling and envy , hated and hating one another .
56003004	But when the mercy of God our Saviour , and his love to man was seen ,
56003005	Not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves , but in the measure of his mercy , he gave us salvation , through the washing of the new birth and the giving of new life in the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	Which he gave us freely through Jesus Christ our Saviour ;
56003007	So that , having been given righteousness through grace , we might have a part in the heritage , the hope of eternal life .
56003008	This is a true saying ; and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things , so that those who have had faith in God may give attention to good works . These things are good and of profit to men ;
56003009	But have nothing to do with foolish questionings , and lists of generations , and fights and arguments about the law ; for they are of no profit and foolish .
56003010	A man whose opinions are not those of the church , after a first and second protest , is to be kept out of your society ;
56003011	Clearly he is in error and a sinner , being self-judged .
56003012	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me at Nicopolis : for it is my purpose to be there for the winter .
56003013	Send Zenas , the man of law , and Apollos on their journey with all care , so that they may be in need of nothing .
56003014	And let our people go on with good works for necessary purposes , so that they may not be without fruit .
56003015	All who are with me send you their love . Give our love to our friends in the faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , to Philemon , our dear helper in the faith ,
57001002	And to Apphia , our sister , and to Archippus , our brother in God's army , and to the church in your house :
57001003	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you ,
57001005	Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints ;
57001006	That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power , in the knowledge of every good thing in you , for Christ .
57001007	For I had great joy and comfort in your love , because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you , brother .
57001008	And so , though I might , in the name of Christ , give you orders to do what is right ,
57001009	Still , because of love , in place of an order , I make a request to you , I , Paul , an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus :
57001010	My request is for my child Onesimus , the child of my chains ,
57001011	Who in the past was of no profit to you , but now is of profit to you and to me :
57001012	Whom I have sent back to you , him who is my very heart :
57001013	Though my desire was to keep him with me , to be my servant in the chains of the good news , in your place :
57001014	But without your approval I would do nothing ; so that your good works might not be forced , but done freely from your heart .
57001015	For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time , so that you might have him for ever ;
57001016	No longer as a servant , but more than a servant , a brother , very dear to me specially , but much more to you , in the flesh as well as in the Lord .
57001017	If then you take me to be your friend and brother , take him in as myself .
57001018	If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything , put it to my account .
57001019	I , Paul , writing this myself , say , I will make payment to you : and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life .
57001020	So brother , let me have joy of you in the Lord : give new life to my heart in Christ .
57001021	Being certain that you will do my desire , I am writing to you , in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say .
57001022	And make a room ready for me ; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you .
57001023	Epaphras , my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends you his love ;
57001024	And so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my brother-workers .
57001025	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . So be it .
58001001	In times past the word of God came to our fathers through the prophets , in different parts and in different ways ;
58001002	But now , at the end of these days , it has come to us through his Son , to whom he has given all things for a heritage , and through whom he made the order of the generations ;
58001003	Who , being the outshining of his glory , the true image of his substance , supporting all things by the word of his power , having given himself as an offering making clean from sins , took his seat at the right hand of God in heaven ;
58001004	Having become by so much better than the angels , as the name which is his heritage is more noble than theirs .
58001005	To which of the angels did God say at any time , You are my Son , this day I have given you being ? or , I will be his Father , and he will be my Son ?
58001006	And again , when he is sending his only Son into the world , he says , Let all the angels of God give him worship .
58001007	And of the angels he says , Who makes his angels winds , and his servants flames of fire :
58001008	But of the Son he says , Your seat of power , O God , is for ever and ever ; and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness .
58001009	You have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil ; and so God , your God , has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you .
58001010	You , Lord , at the first did put the earth on its base , and the heavens are the works of your hands :
58001011	They will come to their end ; but you are for ever ; they will become old as a robe ;
58001012	They will be rolled up like a cloth , even like a robe , and they will be changed : but you are the same and your years will have no end .
58001013	But of which of the angels has he said at any time , Take your seat at my right hand till I put all those who are against you under your feet ?
58001014	Are they not all helping spirits , who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation ?
58002001	For this reason there is the more need for us to give attention to the things which have come to our ears , for fear that by chance we might be slipping away .
58002002	Because if the word which came through the angels was fixed , and in the past every evil act against God's orders was given its full punishment ;
58002003	What will come on us , if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation ? a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the Lord , and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came ;
58002004	And God was a witness with them , by signs and wonders , and by more than natural powers , and by his distribution of the Holy Spirit at his pleasure .
58002005	For he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come , of which I am writing .
58002006	But a certain writer has given his witness , saying , What is man , that you keep him in mind ? what is the son of man , that you take him into account ?
58002007	You made him a little lower than the angels ; you gave him a crown of glory and honour , and made him ruler over all the works of your hands :
58002008	You put all things under his feet . For in making man the ruler over all things , God did not put anything outside his authority ; though we do not see everything under him now .
58002009	But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels , even Jesus , crowned with glory and honour , because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of God he might undergo death for all men .
58002010	Because it was right for him , for whom and through whom all things have being , in guiding his sons to glory , to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain .
58002011	For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family ; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers ,
58002012	Saying , I will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers , I will make a song of praise to you before the church .
58002013	And again he says , I will put my faith in him . And again , See , I am here , and the children which God has given to me .
58002014	And because the children are flesh and blood , he took a body himself and became like them ; so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death , that is to say , the Evil One ;
58002015	And let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death , go free .
58002016	For , truly , he does not take on the life of angels , but that of the seed of Abraham .
58002017	Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way , so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God , making offerings for the sins of the people .
58002018	For having been put to the test himself , he is able to give help to others when they are tested .
58003001	For this reason , holy brothers , marked out to have a part in heaven , give thought to Jesus the representative and high priest of our faith ;
58003002	Who kept faith with God who gave him his place , even as Moses did in all his house .
58003003	And it was right for this man to have more honour than Moses , even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house .
58003004	For every house has a builder ; but the builder of all things is God .
58003005	And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant , in all his house , and as a witness of those things which were to be said later ;
58003006	But Christ as a son , over his house ; whose house are we , if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end .
58003007	And so , as the Holy Spirit says , Today if you let his voice come to your ears ,
58003008	Be not hard of heart , as when you made me angry , on the day of testing in the waste land ,
58003009	When your fathers put me to the test , and saw my works for forty years .
58003010	So that I was angry with this generation , and I said , Their hearts are in error at all times , and they have no knowledge of my ways ;
58003011	And being angry I made an oath , saying , They may not come into my rest .
58003012	My brothers , take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief , turning away from the living God :
58003013	But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today ; so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin :
58003014	For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start , even till the end , we have a part with Christ ;
58003015	As it is said , Today if you will let his voice come to your ears , be not hard of heart , as when you made him angry .
58003016	Who made him angry when his voice came to them ? was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses ?
58003017	And with whom was he angry for forty years ? was it not with those who did evil , who came to their deaths in the waste land ?
58003018	And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest ? was it not to those who went against his orders ?
58003019	So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief .
58004001	Let us then , though we still have God's word that we may come into his rest , go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so .
58004002	And , truly , the good news came to us , even as it did to them ; but the hearing of the word did them no good , because they were not united in faith with the true hearers .
58004003	For those of us who have belief come into his rest ; even as he has said , As I said in my oath when I was angry , They may not come into my rest : though the works were done from the time of the making of the world .
58004004	For in one place he has said of the seventh day , And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day ;
58004005	And in the same place he says again , They will not come into my rest .
58004006	So that as it is clear that some have to go in , and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God's orders ,
58004007	After a long time , again naming a certain day , he says in David , Today ( as he had said before ) , Today if you will let his voice come to your ears , be not hard of heart ,
58004008	For if Joshua had given them rest , he would not have said anything about another day .
58004009	So that there is still a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God .
58004010	For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works , as God did from his .
58004011	Because of this , let us have a strong desire to come into that rest , and let no one go after the example of those who went against God's orders .
58004012	For the word of God is living and full of power , and is sharper than any two-edged sword , cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit , the bones and the muscles , and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart .
58004013	And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him ; there is nothing covered , but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
58004014	Having then a great high priest , who has made his way through the heavens , even Jesus the Son of God , let us be strong in our faith .
58004015	For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh ; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested , but without sin .
58004016	Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear , so that mercy may be given to us , and we may get grace for our help in time of need .
58005001	Every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those things which have to do with God , so that he may make offerings for sins .
58005002	He is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way , because he himself is feeble ;
58005003	And being feeble , he has to make sin-offerings for himself as well as for the people .
58005004	And no man who is not given authority by God , as Aaron was , takes this honour for himself .
58005005	In the same way Christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest , but was given it by him who said , You are my Son , this day I have given you being :
58005006	As he says in another place , You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek .
58005007	Who in the days of his flesh , having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death , had his prayer answered because of his fear of God .
58005008	And though he was a Son , through the pain which he underwent , the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under God's orders ;
58005009	And when he had been made complete , he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders ;
58005010	Being named by God a high priest of the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	Of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear , because you are slow of hearing .
58005012	And though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers , you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of God's revelation ; you have become like babies who have need of milk , and not of solid food .
58005013	For everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness : he is a child .
58005014	But solid food is for men of full growth , even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil .
58006001	For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth ; not building again that on which it is based , that is , the turning of the heart from dead works , and faith in God ,
58006002	The teaching of baptisms , and of the putting on of hands , and of the future life of the dead , and of the judging on the last day .
58006003	Now we will do this , if God lets us .
58006004	As for those who at one time saw the light , tasting the good things from heaven , and having their part in the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	With knowledge of the good word of God , and of the powers of the coming time ,
58006006	And then let themselves be turned away , it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time ; because they themselves put the Son of God on the cross again , openly shaming him .
58006007	For a land , drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked , has a blessing from God :
58006008	But if it sends up thorns and evil plants , it is of no use and is ready to be cursed ; its only end is to be burned .
58006009	But , my loved ones , though we say this , we are certain that you have better things in you , things which go with salvation ;
58006010	For God is true , and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name , in the help which you gave and still give to the saints .
58006011	And it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end :
58006012	So that you may not be slow in heart , but may take as your example those to whom God has given their heritage , because of their faith and their long waiting .
58006013	For when God made his oath to Abraham , because there was no greater oath , he made it by himself ,
58006014	Saying , Be certain that I will give you my blessing , and make your numbers very great .
58006015	And so , when he had been waiting calmly for a long time , God's word to him was put into effect .
58006016	For men at all times make their oaths by what is greater ; and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath .
58006017	So that when it was God's desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage , that his purpose was fixed , he made it more certain with an oath ;
58006018	So that we , who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us , may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things , in which it is not possible for God to be false ;
58006019	And this hope is like a strong band for our souls , fixed and certain , and going in to that which is inside the veil ;
58006020	Where Jesus has gone before us , as a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	For this Melchizedek , the king of Salem , a priest of the Most High God , who gave Abraham his blessing , meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death ,
58007002	And to whom Abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had , being first named King of righteousness , and then in addition , King of Salem , that is to say , King of peace ;
58007003	Being without father or mother , or family , having no birth or end to his life , being made like the Son of God , is a priest for ever .
58007004	Now see how great this man was , to whom our father Abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight .
58007005	And it is true that by the law , those of the sons of Levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the people's goods ; that is to say , they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of Abraham .
58007006	But this man , who was not of their family , took the tenth from Abraham , and gave a blessing to him to whom God had given his undertaking .
58007007	But there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater .
58007008	Now at the present time , men over whom death has power take the tenth ; but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living .
58007009	And we may say that in Abraham , even Levi , who has a right to take the tenth part , gave it ;
58007010	Because he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek came to him .
58007011	Now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of Levi ( for the law was given to the people in connection with them ) , what need was there for another priest who was of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron ?
58007012	Because if the priests are changed , it is necessary to make a change in the law .
58007013	For he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe , of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar .
58007014	Because it is clear that our Lord comes out of Judah , and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe .
58007015	And this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like Melchizedek ,
58007016	That is to say , not made by a law based on the flesh , but by the power of a life without end :
58007017	For it has been witnessed of him , You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek .
58007018	So the law which went before is put on one side , because it was feeble and without profit .
58007019	( Because the law made nothing complete ) , and in its place there is a better hope , through which we come near to God .
58007020	And as this is not without the taking of an oath
58007021	( For those were made priests without an oath , but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him , The Lord gave his oath , which he will not take back , that you are a priest for ever ) ;
58007022	By so much is it a better agreement which we have through Jesus .
58007023	And it is true that there have been a great number of those priests , because death does not let them go on for ever ;
58007024	But this priest , because his life goes on for ever , is unchanging .
58007025	So that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to God through him , because he is ever living to make prayer to God for them .
58007026	It was right for us to have such a high priest , one who is holy and without evil , doing no wrong , having no part with sinners , and made higher than the heavens :
58007027	Who has no need to make offerings for sins every day , like those high priests , first for himself , and then for the people ; because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself .
58007028	The law makes high priests of men who are feeble ; but the word of the oath , which was made after the law , gives that position to a Son , in whom all good is for ever complete .
58008001	Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point : We have such a high priest , who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven ,
58008002	As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent , which was put up by God , not by man .
58008003	Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings ; so that it is necessary for this man , like them , to have something for an offering .
58008004	If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all , because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law ;
58008005	Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven , as Moses , when he was about to make the Tent , had special orders from God : for , See , he said , that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain .
58008006	But now his position as priest is higher . because through him God has made a better agreement with man , based on the giving of better things .
58008007	For if that first agreement had been as good as possible , there would have been no place for a second .
58008008	For , protesting against them , he says , See , the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah ;
58008009	Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand , to be their guide out of the land of Egypt ; for they did not keep the agreement with me , and I gave them up , says the Lord .
58008010	For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days : I will put my laws into their minds , writing them in their hearts : and I will be their God , and they will be my people :
58008011	And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother , or his neighbour , saying , This is the knowledge of the Lord : for they will all have knowledge of me , great and small .
58008012	And I will have mercy on their evil-doing , and I will not keep their sins in mind .
58008013	When he says , A new agreement , he has made the first agreement old . But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer .
58009001	Now the first agreement had its rules of worship , and a holy order .
58009002	For the first Tent was made ready , having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread ; and this is named the holy place .
58009003	And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies ;
58009004	Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes , and the ark of the agreement , which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna , and Aaron's rod which put out buds , and the stones with the writing of the agreement ;
58009005	And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat ; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail .
58009006	Now while these things were in existence , the priests went into the first Tent at all times , for prayer and the making of offerings .
58009007	But only the high priest went into the second , once a year , not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people :
58009008	The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open , while the first Tent was still in being ;
58009009	And this is an image of the present time ; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean ,
58009010	Because they are only rules of the flesh , of meats and drinks and washings , which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right .
58009011	But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future , through this greater and better Tent , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this world ,
58009012	And has gone once and for ever into the holy place , having got eternal salvation , not through the blood of goats and young oxen , but through his blood .
58009013	For if the blood of goats and oxen , and the dust from the burning of a young cow , being put on the unclean , make the flesh clean :
58009014	How much more will the blood of Christ , who , being without sin , made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit , make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God ?
58009015	And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being , so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death , the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage .
58009016	Because where there is a testament , there has to be the death of the man who made it .
58009017	For a testament has effect after death ; for what power has it while the man who made it is living ?
58009018	So that even the first agreement was not made without blood .
58009019	For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people , he took the blood of goats and young oxen , with water and red wool and hyssop , and put it on the book itself and on all the people ,
58009020	Saying , This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you .
58009021	And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way .
58009022	And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood , and without blood there is no forgiveness .
58009023	For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings ; but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these .
58009024	For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by men's hands as the copy of the true one ; but he went into heaven itself , and now takes his place before the face of God for us .
58009025	And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again , as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his ;
58009026	For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world : but now he has come to us at the end of the old order , to put away sin by the offering of himself .
58009027	And because by God's law death comes to men once , and after that they are judged ;
58009028	So Christ , having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men , will be seen a second time , without sin , by those who are waiting for him , for their salvation .
58010001	For the law , being only a poor copy of the future good things , and not the true image of those things , is never able to make the people who come to the altar every year with the same offerings completely clean .
58010002	For if this had been possible , would there not have been an end of those offerings , because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins ?
58010003	But year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings .
58010004	Because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins .
58010005	So that when he comes into the world , he says , You had no desire for offerings , but you made a body ready for me ;
58010006	You had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin .
58010007	Then I said , See , I have come to do your pleasure , O God ( as it is said of me in the roll of the book ) .
58010008	After saying , You had no desire for offerings , for burned offerings or offerings for sin ( which are made by the law ) and you had no pleasure in them ,
58010009	Then he said , See , I have come to do your pleasure . He took away the old order , so that he might put the new order in its place .
58010010	By that pleasure we have been made holy , by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever .
58010011	And every priest takes his place at the altar day by day , doing what is necessary , and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins .
58010012	But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever , he took his place at the right hand of God ;
58010013	And has been waiting there from that time , till all who are against him are made a foot-rest for his feet .
58010014	Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy .
58010015	And the Holy Spirit is a witness for us : for after he had said ,
58010016	This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days , says the Lord ; I will put my laws in their hearts , writing them in their minds ; he said ,
58010017	And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil-doings .
58010018	Now where there is forgiveness of these , there is no more offering for sin .
58010019	So then , my brothers , being able to go into the holy place without fear , because of the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	By the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
58010021	And having a great priest over the house of God ,
58010022	Let us go in with true hearts , in certain faith , having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water :
58010023	Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking , for he is true who has given his word :
58010024	And let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works ;
58010025	Not giving up our meetings , as is the way of some , but keeping one another strong in faith ; and all the more because you see the day coming near .
58010026	For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true , there is no more offering for sins ,
58010027	But only a great fear of being judged , and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God .
58010028	A man who has gone against the law of Moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses :
58010029	But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot , and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing , and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace , be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment ?
58010030	For we have had experience of him who says , Punishment is mine , I will give reward . And again , The Lord will be judge of his people .
58010031	We may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living God .
58010032	But give thought to the days after you had seen the light , when you went through a great war of troubles ;
58010033	In part , in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts , before the eyes of everyone , and in part , in being united with those who were attacked in this way .
58010034	For you had pity on those who were in prison , and had joy in the loss of your property , in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever .
58010035	So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded .
58010036	For , having done what was right in God's eyes , you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you .
58010037	In a very little time he who is coming will come ; he will not be slow .
58010038	But the upright man will be living by his faith ; and if he goes back , my soul will have no pleasure in him .
58010039	But we are not of those who go back to destruction ; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul .
58011001	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , and the sign that the things not seen are true .
58011002	For by it our fathers had God's approval .
58011003	By faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be .
58011004	By faith Abel made a better offering to God than Cain , and he had witness through it of his righteousness , God giving his approval of his offering : and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death ; he was seen no longer , for God took him away : for before he was taken , witness had been given that he was well-pleasing to God :
58011006	And without faith it is not possible to be well-pleasing to him , for it is necessary for anyone who comes to God to have the belief that God is , and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him .
58011007	By faith Noah , being moved by the fear of God , made ready an ark for the salvation of his family , because God had given him news of things which were not seen at the time ; and through it the world was judged by him , and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham did as God said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage , and went out without knowledge of where he was going .
58011009	By faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement , as in a strange land , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , who had a part with him in the same heritage :
58011010	For he was looking for the strong town , whose builder and maker is God .
58011011	And by faith Sarah herself had power to give birth , when she was very old , because she had faith in him who gave his word ;
58011012	So that from one man , who was near to death , came children in number as the stars in heaven , or as the sand by the seaside , which may not be numbered .
58011013	All these came to their end in faith , not having had the heritage ; but having seen it with delight far away , they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth .
58011014	For those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves .
58011015	And truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out , they would have had chances of turning back .
58011016	But now their desire is for a better country , that is to say , for one in heaven ; and so it is no shame to God to be named their God ; for he has made ready a town for them .
58011017	By faith Abraham made an offering of Isaac , when he was tested : and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body ,
58011018	Of whom it had been said , From Isaac will your seed take their name :
58011019	Judging that God was able to give life even to the dead ; and because of this he did get him back as if from death .
58011020	By faith Isaac , blessing Jacob and Esau , gave news of things to come .
58011021	By faith Jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of Joseph , when he was near to death ; and gave God worship , supported by his stick .
58011022	By faith Joseph , when his end was near , said that the children of Israel would go out of Egypt ; and gave orders about his bones .
58011023	By faith Moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth , because they saw that he was a fair child ; and they had no fear of the king's orders .
58011024	By faith Moses , when he became a man , had no desire to be named the son of Pharaoh's daughter ;
58011025	Feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of God , than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin ;
58011026	Judging a part in the shame of Christ to be better than all the wealth of Egypt ; for he was looking forward to his reward .
58011027	By faith he went out of Egypt , not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king ; for he kept on his way , as seeing him who is unseen .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover , and put the sign of the blood on the houses , so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death .
58011029	By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it had been dry land , though the Egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho came down , after they had been circled for seven days .
58011031	By faith Rahab , the loose woman , was not put to death with those who had gone against God's orders , because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land .
58011032	What more am I to say ? For there would not be time to give the stories of Gideon , Barak , Samson , and Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets :
58011033	Who through faith overcame kingdoms , did righteousness , got their reward , kept the mouths of lions shut ,
58011034	Put out the power of fire , got safely away from the edge of the sword , were made strong when they had been feeble , became full of power in war , and put to flight the armies of the nations .
58011035	Women had their dead given back to them living ; others let themselves be cruelly attacked , having no desire to go free , so that they might have a better life to come ;
58011036	And others were tested by being laughed at or by blows , and even with chains and prisons :
58011037	They were stoned , they were cut up with knives , they were tested , they were put to death with the sword , they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins ; being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked ,
58011038	Wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks ; for whom the world was not good enough .
58011039	And not one of these got the good things of the agreement , though they all had a good record through faith ,
58011040	Because God had kept some better thing for us , so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us .
58012001	For this reason , as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses , putting off every weight , and the sin into which we come so readily , let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us ,
58012002	Having our eyes fixed on Jesus , the guide and end of our faith , who went through the pains of the cross , not caring for the shame , because of the joy which was before him , and who has now taken his place at the right hand of God's seat of power .
58012003	Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself , so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose .
58012004	Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin :
58012005	And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons , My son , do not make little of the Lord's punishment , and do not give up hope when you are judged by him ;
58012006	For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones ; everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod .
58012007	It is for your training that you undergo these things ; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons ; for what son does not have punishment from his father ?
58012008	But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part , then you are not true sons , but children of shame .
58012009	And again , if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect , how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits , and have life ?
58012010	For they truly gave us punishment for a short time , as it seemed good to them ; but he does it for our profit , so that we may become holy as he is .
58012011	At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy : but after , those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness .
58012012	For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up , and let the feeble knees be made strong ,
58012013	And make straight roads for your feet , so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way , but may be made strong .
58012014	Let your desire be for peace with all men , and to be made holy , without which no man may see the Lord ;
58012015	Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God ; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you , and that some of you may be made unclean by it ;
58012016	And that there may not be any evil liver , or any man without respect for God , like Esau , who let his birthright go for a plate of food .
58012017	For you have knowledge that even long after , when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage , he was turned away , though he made his request frequently and with weeping ; because the past might not be changed .
58012018	You have not come to a mountain which may be touched , and is burning with fire , and to a black cloud , and a dark smoke , and a violent wind ,
58012019	And to the sound of a horn , and the voice of words , the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them :
58012020	For the order which said , If the mountain is touched even by a beast , the beast is to be stoned , seemed hard to them ;
58012021	And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said , I am shaking and full of fear .
58012022	But you have come to the mountain of Zion , to the place of the living God , to the Jerusalem which is in heaven , and to an army of angels which may not be numbered ,
58012023	To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven , and to God the judge of all , and to the spirits of good men made complete ,
58012024	And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man , and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abel's blood .
58012025	See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you . For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment , what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven ?
58012026	Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth ; but now he has made an oath , saying , There will be still one more shaking , not only of the earth , but of heaven .
58012027	And the words , Still one more , make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking , as of things which are made , so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible .
58012028	If then , we have a kingdom which will never be moved , let us have grace , so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect :
58012029	For our God is an all-burning fire .
58013001	Go on loving your brothers in the faith .
58013002	Take care to keep open house : because in this way some have had angels as their guests , without being conscious of it .
58013003	Keep in mind those who are in chains , as if you were chained with them , and those who are in trouble , as being yourselves in the body .
58013004	Let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean ; for men untrue in married life will be judged by God .
58013005	Be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have ; for he himself has said , I will be with you at all times .
58013006	So that we say with a good heart , The Lord is my helper ; I will have no fear : what is man able to do to me ?
58013007	Keep in mind those who were over you , and who gave you the word of God ; seeing the outcome of their way of life , let your faith be like theirs .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever .
58013009	Do not be turned away by different strange teachings , because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace , and not by meats , which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them .
58013010	We have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the Tent may not take food .
58013011	For the bodies of the beasts whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the circle of the tents .
58013012	For this reason Jesus was put to death outside the walls , so that he might make the people holy by his blood .
58013013	Let us then go out to him outside the circle of the tents , taking his shame on ourselves .
58013014	For here we have no fixed resting-place , but our search is for the one which is to come .
58013015	Let us then make offerings of praise to God at all times through him , that is to say , the fruit of lips giving witness to his name .
58013016	But go on doing good and giving to others , because God is well-pleased with such offerings .
58013017	Give ear to those who are rulers over you , and do as they say : for they keep watch over your souls , ready to give an account of them ; let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief , because that would be of no profit to you .
58013018	Make prayers for us , for we are certain that our hearts are free from the sense of sin , desiring the right way of life in all things .
58013019	I make this request more strongly , in the hope of coming back to you more quickly .
58013020	Now may the God of peace , who made that great keeper of his flock , even our Lord Jesus , come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement ,
58013021	Make you full of every good work and ready to do all his desires , working in us whatever is pleasing in his eyes through Jesus Christ ; and may the glory be given to him for ever and ever . So be it .
58013022	But , brothers , take kindly the words which I have said for your profit ; for I have not sent you a long letter .
58013023	Our brother Timothy has been let out of prison ; and if he comes here in a short time , he and I will come to you together .
58013024	Give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you , and to all the saints . Those who are in Italy send you their love .
58013025	May grace be with you all .
59001001	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth .
59001002	Let it be all joy to you , my brothers , when you undergo tests of every sort ;
59001003	Because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope ;
59001004	But let this power have its full effect , so that you may be made complete , needing nothing .
59001005	But if any man among you is without wisdom , let him make his request to God , who gives freely to all without an unkind word , and it will be given to him .
59001006	Let him make his request in faith , doubting nothing ; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea , which are troubled by the driving of the wind .
59001007	Let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the Lord ;
59001008	For there is a division in his mind , and he is uncertain in all his ways .
59001009	But let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up ;
59001010	But the man of wealth , that he is made low ; because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end .
59001011	For when the sun comes up with its burning heat , the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower ; so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways .
59001012	There is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing ; because , if he has God's approval , he will be given the crown of life , which the Lord has said he will give to those who have love for him .
59001013	Let no man say when he is tested , I am tested by God ; for it is not possible for God to be tested by evil , and he himself puts no man to such a test :
59001014	But every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire .
59001015	Then when its time comes , desire gives birth to sin ; and sin , when it is of full growth , gives birth to death .
59001016	Do not be turned from the right way , dear brothers .
59001017	Every good and true thing is given to us from heaven , coming from the Father of lights , with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning .
59001018	Of his purpose he gave us being , by his true word , so that we might be , in a sense , the first-fruits of all the things which he had made .
59001019	You have knowledge of this , dear brothers . But let every man be quick in hearing , slow in words , slow to get angry ;
59001020	For the righteousness of God does not come about by the wrath of man .
59001021	For this reason , putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil , take into your souls without pride the word which , being planted there , is able to give you salvation .
59001022	But be doers of the word , and not only hearers of it , blinding yourselves with false ideas .
59001023	Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass ;
59001024	For after looking at himself he goes away , and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like .
59001025	But he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free , being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect , this man will have a blessing on his acts .
59001026	If a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false , this man's religion is of no value .
59001027	The religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our God and Father is this : to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble , and to keep oneself untouched by the world .
59002001	My brothers , if you have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory , do not take a man's position into account .
59002002	For if a man comes into your Synagogue in fair clothing and with a gold ring , and a poor man comes in with dirty clothing ,
59002003	And you do honour to the man in fair clothing and say , Come here and take this good place ; and you say to the poor man , Take up your position there , or be seated at my feet ;
59002004	Is there not a division in your minds ? have you not become judges with evil thoughts ?
59002005	Give ear , my dear brothers ; are not those who are poor in the things of this world marked out by God to have faith as their wealth , and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he will give to those who have love for him ?
59002006	But you have put the poor man to shame . Are not the men of wealth rulers over you ? do they not take you by force before their judges ?
59002007	Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you ?
59002008	But if you keep the greatest law of all , as it is given in the holy Writings , Have love for your neighbour as for yourself , you do well :
59002009	But if you take a man's position into account , you do evil , and are judged as evil-doers by the law .
59002010	For anyone who keeps all the law , but makes a slip in one point , is judged to have gone against it all .
59002011	For he who said , Do not be untrue in married life , is the same who said , Put no man to death . Now if you are not untrue in married life , but you put a man to death , the law is broken .
59002012	Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free .
59002013	For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy , but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging .
59002014	What use is it , my brothers , for a man to say that he has faith , if he does nothing ? will such a faith give him salvation ?
59002015	If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the day's food ,
59002016	And one of you says to them , Go in peace , be warm and full of food ; but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need , what profit is there in this ?
59002017	Even so faith without works is dead .
59002018	But a man may say , You have faith and I have works ; let me see your faith without your works , and I will make my faith clear to you by my works .
59002019	You have the belief that God is one , and you do well : the evil spirits have the same belief , shaking with fear .
59002020	Do you not see , O foolish man , that faith without works is of no use ?
59002021	Was not the righteousness of Abraham our father judged by his works , when he made an offering of Isaac his son on the altar ?
59002022	You see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them ;
59002023	And the holy Writings were put into effect which said , And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness ; and he was named the friend of God .
59002024	You see that a man's righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only .
59002025	And in the same way , was not the righteousness of Rahab , the loose woman , judged by her works , when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way ?
59002026	For as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead .
59003001	Do not all be teachers , my brothers , because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others .
59003002	For we all go wrong in a number of things . If a man never makes a slip in his talk , then he is a complete man and able to keep all his body in control .
59003003	Now if we put bits of iron into horses ' mouths so that they may be guided by us , we have complete control of their bodies .
59003004	And again ships , though they are so great and are moved by violent winds , are turned by a very small guiding-blade , at the impulse of the man who is using it .
59003005	Even so the tongue is a small part of the body , but it takes credit for great things . How much wood may be lighted by a very little fire !
59003006	And the tongue is a fire ; it is the power of evil placed in our bodies , making all the body unclean , putting the wheel of life on fire , and getting its fire from hell .
59003007	For every sort of beast and bird and every living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is under his authority ;
59003008	But the tongue may not be controlled by man ; it is an unresting evil , it is full of the poison of death .
59003009	With it we give praise to our Lord and Father ; and with it we put a curse on men who are made in God's image .
59003010	Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing . My brothers , it is not right for these things to be so .
59003011	Does the fountain send from the same outlet sweet and bitter water ?
59003012	Is a fig-tree able to give us olives , my brothers , or do we get figs from a vine , or sweet water from the salt sea ?
59003013	Who has wisdom and good sense among you ? let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom .
59003014	But if you have bitter envy in your heart and the desire to get the better of others , have no pride in this , talking falsely against what is true .
59003015	This wisdom is not from heaven , but is of the earth and the flesh and the Evil One .
59003016	For where envy is , and the desire to get the better of others , there is no order , but every sort of evil-doing .
59003017	But the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy , then gentle , readily giving way in argument , full of peace and mercy and good works , not doubting , not seeming other than it is .
59003018	And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace .
59004001	What is the cause of wars and fighting among you ? is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies ?
59004002	You are burning with desire , and have not your desire , so you put men to death ; you are full of envy , and you are not able to get your desire , so you are fighting and making war ; you have not your desire , because you do not make request for it .
59004003	You make your request but you do not get it , because your request has been wrongly made , desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure .
59004004	O you who are false to God , do you not see that the friends of this world are not God's friends ? Every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of God .
59004005	Or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy Writings say , The spirit which God put into our hearts has a strong desire for us ?
59004006	But he gives more grace . So that the Writings say , God is against the men of pride , but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him .
59004007	For this cause be ruled by God ; but make war on the Evil One and he will be put to flight before you .
59004008	Come near to God and he will come near to you . Make your hands clean , you evil-doers ; put away deceit from your hearts , you false in mind .
59004009	Be troubled , with sorrow and weeping ; let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief .
59004010	Make yourselves low in the eyes of the Lord and you will be lifted up by him .
59004011	Do not say evil against one another , my brothers . He who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brother's judge , says evil against the law and is judging the law : and in judging the law you become , not a doer of the law but a judge .
59004012	There is only one judge and law-giver , even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction ; but who are you to be your neighbour's judge ?
59004013	How foolish it is to say , Today or tomorrow we will go into this town , and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth :
59004014	When you are not certain what will take place tomorrow . What is your life ? It is a mist , which is seen for a little time and then is gone .
59004015	But the right thing to say would be , If it is the Lord's pleasure and if we are still living , we will do this and that .
59004016	But now you go on glorying in your pride : and all such glorying is evil .
59004017	The man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it , to him it is sin .
59005001	Come now , you men of wealth , give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you .
59005002	Your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing .
59005003	Your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you , burning into your flesh . You have put by your store in the last days .
59005004	See , the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field , is crying out against you ; and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the Lord of armies .
59005005	You have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure ; you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction .
59005006	You have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death . He puts up no fight against you .
59005007	Go on waiting calmly , my brothers , till the coming of the Lord , like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come .
59005008	Be as calm in your waiting ; let your hearts be strong : because the coming of the Lord is near .
59005009	Say no hard things against one another , brothers , so that you will not be judged ; see , the judge is waiting at the doors .
59005010	Take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble , the prophets who gave to men the words of the Lord .
59005011	We say that those men who have gone through pain are happy : you have the story of Job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the Lord was full of pity and mercy in the end .
59005012	But most of all , my brothers , do not take oaths , not by the heaven , or by the earth , or by any other thing : but let your Yes be Yes , and your No be No : so that you may not be judged .
59005013	Is anyone among you in trouble ? let him say prayers . Is anyone glad ? let him make a song of praise .
59005014	Is anyone among you ill ? let him send for the rulers of the church ; and let them say prayers over him , putting oil on him in the name of the Lord .
59005015	And by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well , and he will be lifted up by the Lord , and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness .
59005016	So then , make a statement of your sins to one another , and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well . The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working .
59005017	Elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are , and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain ; and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months .
59005018	And he made another prayer , and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit .
59005019	My brothers , if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error ,
59005020	Be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way , keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number .
60001001	Peter , an Apostle of Jesus Christ , to the saints who are living in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
60001002	Who , through the purpose of God , have been made holy by the Spirit , disciples of Jesus , made clean by his blood : May you have grace and peace in full measure .
60001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who through his great mercy has given us a new birth and a living hope by the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60001004	And a heritage fair , holy and for ever new , waiting in heaven for you ,
60001005	Who , by the power of God are kept , through faith , for that salvation , which will be seen at the last day .
60001006	You have cause for great joy in this , though it may have been necessary for you to be troubled for a little time , being tested in all sorts of ways ,
60001007	So that the true metal of your faith , being of much greater value than gold ( which , though it comes to an end , is tested by fire ) , may come to light in praise and glory and honour , at the revelation of Jesus Christ :
60001008	To whom your love is given , though you have not seen him ; and the faith which you have in him , though you do not see him now , gives you joy greater than words and full of glory :
60001009	For so you have the true end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
60001010	For the prophets who gave the news of the grace which would come to you , made search with all care for knowledge of this salvation ;
60001011	Attempting to see what sort of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them was pointing to , when it gave witness to the pains which Christ would undergo and the glories which would come after them .
60001012	And it was made clear to those prophets that they were God's servants not for themselves but for you , to give you word of the things which have now come to your ears from the preachers of the good news through the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven ; things which even angels have a desire to see .
60001013	So make your minds ready , and keep on the watch , hoping with all your power for the grace which is to come to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
60001014	Like children ruled by God , do not go back to the old desires of the time when you were without knowledge :
60001015	But be holy in every detail of your lives , as he , whose servants you are , is holy ;
60001016	Because it has been said in the Writings , You are to be holy , for I am holy .
60001017	And if you give the name of Father to him who , judging every man by his acts , has no respect for a man's position , then go in fear while you are on this earth :
60001018	Being conscious that you have been made free from that foolish way of life which was your heritage from your fathers , not through a payment of things like silver or gold which come to destruction ,
60001019	But through holy blood , like that of a clean and unmarked lamb , even the blood of Christ :
60001020	Who was marked out by God before the making of the world , but was caused to be seen in these last times for you ,
60001021	Who through him have faith in God who took him up again from the dead into glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
60001022	And as you have made your souls clean , being ruled by what is true , and loving one another without deceit , see that your love is warm and from the heart :
60001023	Because you have had a new birth , not from the seed of man , but from eternal seed , through the word of a living and unchanging God .
60001024	For it is said , All flesh is like grass , and all its glory like the flower of the grass . The grass becomes dry and the flower dead :
60001025	But the word of the Lord is eternal . And this is the word of the good news which was given to you .
60002001	So putting away all wrongdoing , and all tricks and deceits and envies and evil talk ,
60002002	Be full of desire for the true milk of the word , as babies at their mothers ' breasts , so that you may go on to salvation ;
60002003	If you have had a taste of the grace of the Lord :
60002004	To whom you come , as to a living stone , not honoured by men , but of great and special value to God ;
60002005	You , as living stones , are being made into a house of the spirit , a holy order of priests , making those offerings of the spirit which are pleasing to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	Because it is said in the Writings , See , I am placing a keystone in Zion , of great and special value ; and the man who has faith in him will not be put to shame .
60002007	And the value is for you who have faith ; but it is said for those without faith , The very stone which the builders put on one side , was made the chief stone of the building ;
60002008	And , A stone of falling , a rock of trouble ; the word is the cause of their fall , because they go against it , and this was the purpose of God .
60002009	But you are a special people , a holy nation , priests and kings , a people given up completely to God , so that you may make clear the virtues of him who took you out of the dark into the light of heaven .
60002010	In the past you were not a people , but now you are the people of God ; then there was no mercy for you , but now mercy has been given to you .
60002011	My loved ones , I make this request with all my heart , that , as those for whom this world is a strange country , you will keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh which make war against the soul ;
60002012	Being of good behaviour among the Gentiles ; so that though they say now that you are evil-doers , they may see your good works and give glory to God when he comes to be their judge .
60002013	Keep all the laws of men because of the Lord ; those of the king , who is over all ,
60002014	And those of the rulers who are sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers and for the praise of those who do well .
60002015	Because it is God's pleasure that foolish and narrow-minded men may be put to shame by your good behaviour :
60002016	As those who are free , not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing , but living as the servants of God ;
60002017	Have respect for all , loving the brothers , fearing God , honouring the king .
60002018	Servants , take orders from your masters with all respect ; not only if they are good and gentle , but even if they are bad-humoured .
60002019	For it is a sign of grace if a man , desiring to do right in the eyes of God , undergoes pain as punishment for something which he has not done .
60002020	What credit is it if , when you have done evil , you take your punishment quietly ? but if you are given punishment for doing right , and take it quietly , this is pleasing to God .
60002021	This is God's purpose for you : because Jesus himself underwent punishment for you , giving you an example , so that you might go in his footsteps :
60002022	Who did no evil , and there was no deceit in his mouth :
60002023	To sharp words he gave no sharp answer ; when he was undergoing pain , no angry word came from his lips ; but he put himself into the hands of the judge of righteousness :
60002024	He took our sins on himself , giving his body to be nailed on the tree , so that we , being dead to sin , might have a new life in righteousness , and by his wounds we have been made well .
60002025	Because , like sheep , you had gone out of the way ; but now you have come back to him who keeps watch over your souls .
60003001	Wives , be ruled by your husbands ; so that even if some of them give no attention to the word , their hearts may be changed by the behaviour of their wives ,
60003002	When they see your holy behaviour in the fear of God .
60003003	Do not let your ornaments be those of the body such as dressing of the hair , or putting on of jewels of gold or fair clothing ;
60003004	But let them be those of the unseen man of the heart , the ever-shining ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is of great price in the eyes of God .
60003005	And these were the ornaments of the holy women of the past , whose hope was in God , being ruled by their husbands :
60003006	As Sarah was ruled by Abraham , naming him lord ; whose children you are if you do well , and are not put in fear by any danger .
60003007	And you husbands , give thought to your way of life with your wives , giving honour to the woman who is the feebler vessel , but who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life ; so that you may not be kept from prayer .
60003008	Last of all , see that you are all in agreement ; feeling for one another , loving one another like brothers , full of pity , without pride :
60003009	Not giving back evil for evil , or curse for curse , but in place of cursing , blessing ; because this is the purpose of God for you that you may have a heritage of blessing .
60003010	For it is said , Let the man who has a love of life , desiring to see good days , keep his tongue from evil and his lips from words of deceit :
60003011	And let him be turned from evil and do good ; searching for peace and going after it with all his heart .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are on the upright , and his ears are open to their prayers : but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil .
60003013	Who will do you any damage if you keep your minds fixed on what is good ?
60003014	But you are happy if you undergo pain because of righteousness ; have no part in their fear and do not be troubled ;
60003015	But give honour to Christ in your hearts as your Lord ; and be ready at any time when you are questioned about the hope which is in you , to give an answer in the fear of the Lord and without pride ;
60003016	Being conscious that you have done no wrong ; so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as Christians may be put to shame .
60003017	Because if it is God's purpose for you to undergo pain , it is better to do so for well-doing than for evil-doing .
60003018	Because Christ once went through pain for sins , the upright one taking the place of sinners , so that through him we might come back to God ; being put to death in the flesh , but given life in the Spirit ;
60003019	By whom he went to the spirits in prison , preaching to those
60003020	Who , in the days of Noah , went against God's orders ; but God in his mercy kept back the punishment , while Noah got ready the ark , in which a small number , that is to say eight persons , got salvation through water :
60003021	And baptism , of which this is an image , now gives you salvation , not by washing clean the flesh , but by making you free from the sense of sin before God , through the coming again of Jesus Christ from the dead ;
60003022	Who has gone into heaven , and is at the right hand of God , angels and authorities and powers having been put under his rule .
60004001	So that as Jesus was put to death in the flesh , do you yourselves be of the same mind ; for the death of the flesh puts an end to sin ;
60004002	So that you may give the rest of your lives in the flesh , not to the desires of men , but to the purpose of God .
60004003	Because for long enough , in times past , we have been living after the way of the Gentiles , given up to the desires of the flesh , to drinking and feasting and loose behaviour and unclean worship of images ;
60004004	And they are wondering that you no longer go with them in this violent wasting of life , and are saying evil things of you :
60004005	But they will have to give an account of themselves to him who is ready to be the judge of the living and the dead .
60004006	For this was the reason why the good news of Jesus was given even to the dead , so that they might be judged as men in the flesh , but might be living before God in the spirit .
60004007	But the end of all things is near : so be serious in your behaviour and keep on the watch with prayer ;
60004008	And most of all be warm in your love for one another ; because in love there is forgiveness for sins without number :
60004009	Keep open house for all with a glad heart ;
60004010	Making distribution among one another of whatever has been given to you , like true servants of the unmeasured grace of God ;
60004011	If anyone has anything to say , let it be as the words of God ; if anyone has the desire to be the servant of others , let him do it in the strength which is given by God ; so that in all things God may have the glory through Jesus Christ , whose are the glory and the power for ever .
60004012	Dear brothers , do not be surprised , as if it was something strange , if your faith is tested as by fire :
60004013	But be glad that you are given a part in the pains of Christ ; so that at the revelation of his glory you may have great joy .
60004014	If men say evil things of you because of the name of Christ , happy are you ; for the Spirit of glory and of God is resting on you .
60004015	Let no one among you undergo punishment as a taker of life , or as a thief , or as an evil-doer , or as one who is over-interested in other men's business ;
60004016	But if he undergoes punishment as a Christian , that is no shame to him ; let him give glory to God in this name .
60004017	For the time has come for the judging , starting with the church of God ; but if it makes a start with us , what will be the end of those who are not under the rule of God ?
60004018	And if it is hard for even the good man to get salvation , what chance has the man without religion or the sinner ?
60004019	For this reason let those who by the purpose of God undergo punishment , keep on in well-doing and put their souls into the safe hands of their Maker .
60005001	I who am myself one of the rulers of the church , and a witness of the death of Christ , having my part in the coming glory , send this serious request to the chief men among you :
60005002	Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care , using your authority , not as forced to do so , but gladly ; and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind ;
60005003	Not as lords over God's heritage , but making yourselves examples to the flock .
60005004	And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep , you will be given the eternal crown of glory .
60005005	And in the same way , let the younger men be ruled by the older ones . Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants : for God is a hater of pride , but he gives grace to those who make themselves low .
60005006	For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God , so that when the time comes you may be lifted up ;
60005007	Putting all your troubles on him , for he takes care of you .
60005008	Be serious and keep watch ; the Evil One , who is against you , goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food ;
60005009	Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith , in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles .
60005010	And after you have undergone pain for a little time , the God of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through Christ Jesus , will himself give you strength and support , and make you complete in every good thing ;
60005011	His is the power for ever . So be it .
60005012	I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus , a true brother , in my opinion ; comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God ; keep to it .
60005013	She who is in Babylon , who has a part with you in the purpose of God , sends you her love ; and so does my son Mark .
60005014	Give one another the kiss of love . Peace be to you all in Christ .
61001001	Simon Peter , a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who with us have a part in the same holy faith in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ :
61001002	May grace and peace ever be increasing in you , in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord ;
61001003	Because by his power he has given us everything necessary for life and righteousness , through the knowledge of him who has been our guide by his glory and virtue ;
61001004	And through this he has given us the hope of great rewards highly to be valued ; so that by them we might have our part in God's being , and be made free from the destruction which is in the world through the desires of the flesh .
61001005	So , for this very cause , take every care ; joining virtue to faith , and knowledge to virtue ,
61001006	And self-control to knowledge , and a quiet mind to self-control , and fear of God to a quiet mind ,
61001007	And love of the brothers to fear of God , and to love of the brothers , love itself .
61001008	For if you have these things in good measure , they will make you fertile and full of fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	For the man who has not these things is blind , seeing only what is near , having no memory of how he was made clean from his old sins .
61001010	For this reason , my brothers , take all the more care to make your selection and approval certain ; for if you do these things you will never have a fall :
61001011	For so the way will be open to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
61001012	For this reason I will be ready at all times to keep your memory of these things awake , though you have the knowledge of them now and are well based in your present faith .
61001013	And it seems right to me , as long as I am in this tent of flesh , to keep your minds awake by working on your memory ;
61001014	For I am conscious that in a short time I will have to put off this tent of flesh , as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me .
61001015	And I will take every care so that you may have a clear memory of these things after my death .
61001016	For when we gave you news of the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , our teaching was not based on stories put together by art , but we were eye-witnesses of his glory .
61001017	For God the Father gave him honour and glory , when such a voice came to him out of the great glory , saying , This is my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well pleased .
61001018	And this voice came from heaven even to our ears , when we were with him on the holy mountain .
61001019	And so the words of the prophets are made more certain ; and it is well for you to give attention to them as to a light shining in a dark place , till the dawn comes and the morning star is seen in your hearts ;
61001020	Being conscious in the first place that no man by himself may give a special sense to the words of the prophets .
61001021	For these words did not ever come through the impulse of men : but the prophets had them from God , being moved by the Holy Spirit .
61002001	But there were false prophets among the people , as there will be false teachers among you , who will secretly put forward wrong teachings for your destruction , even turning away from the Lord who gave himself for them ; whose destruction will come quickly , and they themselves will be the cause of it .
61002002	And a great number will go with them in their evil ways , through whom the true way will have a bad name .
61002003	And in their desire for profit they will come to you with words of deceit , like traders doing business in souls : whose punishment has been ready for a long time and their destruction is watching for them .
61002004	For if God did not have pity for the angels who did evil , but sent them down into hell , to be kept in chains of eternal night till they were judged ;
61002005	And did not have mercy on the world which then was , but only kept safe Noah , a preacher of righteousness , with seven others , when he let loose the waters over the world of the evil-doers ;
61002006	And sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah , burning them up with fire as an example to those whose way of life might in the future be unpleasing to him ;
61002007	And kept safe Lot , the upright man , who was deeply troubled by the unclean life of the evil-doers
61002008	( Because the soul of that upright man living among them was pained from day to day by seeing and hearing their crimes ) :
61002009	The Lord is able to keep the upright safe in the time of testing , and to keep evil-doers under punishment till the day of judging ;
61002010	But specially those who go after the unclean desires of the flesh , and make sport of authority . Ready to take chances , uncontrolled , they have no fear of saying evil of those in high places :
61002011	Though the angels , who are greater in strength and power , do not make use of violent language against them before the Lord .
61002012	But these men , like beasts without reason , whose natural use is to be taken and put to death , crying out against things of which they have no knowledge , will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others ;
61002013	For the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evil-doing : such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime ; they are like the marks of a disease , like poisoned wounds among you , feasting together with you in joy ;
61002014	Having eyes full of evil desire , never having enough of sin ; turning feeble souls out of the true way ; they are children of cursing , whose hearts are well used to bitter envy ;
61002015	Turning out of the true way , they have gone wandering in error , after the way of Balaam , the son of Beor , who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing ;
61002016	But his wrongdoing was pointed out to him : an ass , talking with a man's voice , put a stop to the error of the prophet .
61002017	These are fountains without water , and mists before a driving storm ; for whom the eternal night is kept in store .
61002018	For with high-sounding false words , making use of the attraction of unclean desires of the flesh , they get into their power those newly made free from those who are living in error ;
61002019	Saying that they will be free , while they themselves are the servants of destruction ; because whatever gets the better of a man makes a servant of him .
61002020	For if , after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again taken in the net and overcome , their last condition is worse than their first .
61002021	For it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness , than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them , after having knowledge of it .
61002022	They are an example of that true saying , The dog has gone back to the food it had put out , and the pig which had been washed to its rolling in the dirty earth .
61003001	My loved ones , this is now my second letter to you , and in this as in the first , I am attempting to keep your true minds awake ;
61003002	So that you may keep in mind the words of the holy prophets in the past , and the law of the Lord and Saviour which was given to you by his Apostles .
61003003	Having first of all the knowledge that in the last days there will be men who , ruled by their evil desires , will make sport of holy things ,
61003004	Saying , Where is the hope of his coming ? From the death of the fathers till now everything has gone on as it was from the making of the world .
61003005	But in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven , and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water , by the word of God ;
61003006	And that the world which then was came to an end through the overflowing of the waters .
61003007	But the present heaven and the present earth have been kept for destruction by fire , which is waiting for them on the day of the judging and destruction of evil men .
61003008	But , my loved ones , keep in mind this one thing , that with the Lord one day is the same as a thousand years , and a thousand years are no more than one day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow in keeping his word , as he seems to some , but he is waiting in mercy for you , not desiring the destruction of any , but that all may be turned from their evil ways .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief ; and in that day the heavens will be rolled up with a great noise , and the substance of the earth will be changed by violent heat , and the world and everything in it will be burned up .
61003011	Seeing then that all these things are coming to such an end , what sort of persons is it right for you to be , in all holy behaviour and righteousness ,
61003012	Looking for and truly desiring the coming of the day of God , when the heavens will come to an end through fire , and the substance of the earth will be changed by the great heat ?
61003013	But having faith in his word , we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth , which will be the resting-place of righteousness .
61003014	For this reason , my loved ones , as you are looking for these things , take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him , free from sin and every evil thing .
61003015	And be certain that the long waiting of the Lord is for salvation ; even as our brother Paul has said in his letters to you , from the wisdom which was given to him ;
61003016	And as he said in all his letters , which had to do with these things ; in which are some hard sayings , so that , like the rest of the holy Writings , they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge , to the destruction of their souls .
61003017	For this reason , my loved ones , having knowledge of these things before they take place , take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled , so falling from your true faith .
61003018	But be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . May he have glory now and for ever . So be it .
62001001	That which was from the first , which has come to our ears , and which we have seen with our eyes , looking on it and touching it with our hands , about the Word of life
62001002	( And the life was made clear to us , and we have seen it and are witnessing to it and giving you word of that eternal life which was with the Father and was seen by us ) ;
62001003	We give you word of all we have seen and everything which has come to our ears , so that you may be united with us ; and we are united with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ :
62001004	And we are writing these things to you so that our joy may be made complete .
62001005	This is the word which came to us from him and which we give to you , that God is light and in him there is nothing dark .
62001006	If we say we are joined to him , and are walking still in the dark , our words are false and our acts are untrue :
62001007	But if we are walking in the light , as he is in the light , we are all united with one another , and the blood of Jesus his Son makes us clean from all sin .
62001008	If we say that we have no sin , we are false to ourselves and there is nothing true in us .
62001009	If we say openly that we have done wrong , he is upright and true to his word , giving us forgiveness of sins and making us clean from all evil .
62001010	If we say that we have no sin , we make him false and his word is not in us .
62002001	My little children , I am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin . And if any man is a sinner , we have a friend and helper with the Father , Jesus Christ , the upright one :
62002002	He is the offering for our sins ; and not for ours only , but for all the world .
62002003	And by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him , if we keep his laws .
62002004	The man who says , I have knowledge of him , and does not keep his laws , is false , and there is nothing true in him :
62002005	But in every man who keeps his word , the love of God is made complete . By this we may be certain that we are in him :
62002006	He who says that he is living in him , will do as he did .
62002007	My loved ones , I do not give you a new law , but an old law which you had from the first ; this old law is the word which came to your ears .
62002008	Again , I give you a new law , which is true in him and in you ; for the night is near its end and the true light is even now shining out .
62002009	He who says that he is in the light , and has hate in his heart for his brother , is still in the dark .
62002010	He who has love for his brother is in the light , and there is no cause of error in him .
62002011	But he who has hate for his brother is in the dark , walking in the dark with no knowledge of where he is going , unable to see because of the dark .
62002012	I am writing to you , my children , because you have forgiveness of sins through his name .
62002013	I am writing to you , fathers , because you have knowledge of him who was from the first . I am writing to you , young men , because you have overcome the Evil One . I have sent a letter to you , children , because you have knowledge of the Father .
62002014	I have sent a letter to you , fathers , because you have knowledge of him who was from the first . I have sent a letter to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God is in you , and because you have overcome the Evil One .
62002015	Have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world . If any man has love for the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
62002016	Because everything in the world , the desire of the flesh , the desire of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father but of the world .
62002017	And the world and its desires is coming to an end : but he who does God's pleasure is living for ever .
62002018	Little children , it is the last hour ; and as you were given word that the Antichrist would come , so now a number of Antichrists have come to you ; and by this we are certain that it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us but they were not of us ; if they had been of us they would still be with us : but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us .
62002020	And you have the Spirit from the Holy One and you all have knowledge .
62002021	I have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true , but because you have knowledge , and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true .
62002022	Who is false but he who says that Jesus is not the Christ ? He is the Antichrist who has no belief in the Father or the Son .
62002023	He who has no belief in the Son has not the Father : he who makes clear his belief in the Son has the Father .
62002024	But as for you , keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first . If you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the Father and the Son .
62002025	And this is the hope which he gave you , even eternal life .
62002026	I am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way .
62002027	As for you , the Spirit which he gave you is still in you , and you have no need of any teacher ; but as his Spirit gives you teaching about all things , and is true and not false , so keep your hearts in him , through the teaching which he has given you .
62002028	And now , my children , keep your hearts in him ; so that at his revelation , we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming .
62002029	If you have knowledge that he is upright , it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring .
62003001	See what great love the Father has given us in naming us the children of God ; and such we are . For this reason the world does not see who we are , because it did not see who he was .
62003002	My loved ones , now we are children of God , and at present it is not clear what we are to be . We are certain that at his revelation we will be like him ; for we will see him as he is .
62003003	And everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy , even as he is holy .
62003004	Everyone who is a sinner goes against the law , for sin is going against the law .
62003005	And you have knowledge that he came to take away sin : and in him there is no sin .
62003006	Anyone who is in him does no sin ; anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him .
62003007	My little children , let no man take you out of the true way : he who does righteousness is upright , even as he is upright ;
62003008	The sinner is a child of the Evil One ; for the Evil One has been a sinner from the first . And the Son of God was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the Evil One .
62003009	Anyone who is a child of God does no sin , because he still has God's seed in him ; he is not able to be a sinner , because God is his Father .
62003010	In this way it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One ; anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother , is not a child of God .
62003011	Because this is the word which was given to you from the first , that we are to have love for one another ;
62003012	Not being of the Evil One like Cain , who put his brother to death . And why did he put him to death ? Because his works were evil and his brother's works were good .
62003013	Do not be surprised , my brothers , if the world has no love for you .
62003014	We are conscious that we have come out of death into life because of our love for the brothers . He who has no love is still in death .
62003015	Anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life , and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him .
62003016	In this we see what love is , because he gave his life for us ; and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers .
62003017	But if a man has this world's goods , and sees that his brother is in need , and keeps his heart shut against his brother , how is it possible for the love of God to be in him ?
62003018	My little children , do not let our love be in word and in tongue , but let it be in act and in good faith .
62003019	In this way we may be certain that we are true , and may give our heart comfort before him ,
62003020	When our heart says that we have done wrong ; because God is greater than our heart , and has knowledge of all things .
62003021	My loved ones , if our heart does not say that we have done wrong , we have no fear before him ;
62003022	And he gives us all our requests , because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes .
62003023	And this is his law , that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love for one another , even as he said to us .
62003024	He who keeps his laws is in God and God is in him . And the Spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us .
62004001	My loved ones , do not put your faith in every spirit , but put them to the test , to see if they are from God : because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	By this you may have knowledge of the Spirit of God : every spirit which says that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God :
62004003	And every spirit which does not say this is not from God : this is the spirit of Antichrist , of which you have had word ; and it is in the world even now .
62004004	You are of God , my little children , and you have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world .
62004005	They are of the world , so their talk is the world's talk , and the world gives ear to them .
62004006	We are of God : he who has the knowledge of God gives ear to us ; he who is not of God does not give ear to us . By this we may see which is the true spirit , and which is the spirit of error .
62004007	My loved ones , let us have love for one another : because love is of God , and everyone who has love is a child of God and has knowledge of God .
62004008	He who has no love has no knowledge of God , because God is love .
62004009	And the love of God was made clear to us when he sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him .
62004010	And this is love , not that we had love for God , but that he had love for us , and sent his Son to be an offering for our sins .
62004011	My loved ones , if God had such love for us , it is right for us to have love for one another .
62004012	No man has ever seen God : if we have love for one another , God is in us and his love is made complete in us :
62004013	And his Spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us .
62004014	And we have seen and give witness that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
62004015	Everyone who says openly that Jesus is the Son of God , has God in him and is in God .
62004016	And we have seen and had faith in the love which God has for us . God is love , and everyone who has love is in God , and God is in him .
62004017	In this way love is made complete in us , so that we may be without fear on the day of judging , because as he is , so are we in this world .
62004018	There is no fear in love : true love has no room for fear , because where fear is , there is pain ; and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love .
62004019	We have the power of loving , because he first had love for us .
62004020	If a man says , I have love for God , and has hate for his brother , his words are false : for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen , able to have love for God whom he has not seen ?
62004021	And this is the word which we have from him , that he who has love for God is to have the same love for his brother .
62005001	Everyone who has faith that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God : and everyone who has love for the Father has love for his child .
62005002	In this way , we are certain that we have love for the children of God , when we have love for God and keep his laws .
62005003	For loving God is keeping his laws : and his laws are not hard .
62005004	Anything which comes from God is able to overcome the world : and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith .
62005005	Who is able to overcome the world but the man who has faith that Jesus is the Son of God ?
62005006	This is he who came by water and by blood , Jesus Christ ; not by water only but by water and by blood .
62005007	And the Spirit is the witness , because the Spirit is true .
62005008	There are three witnesses , the Spirit , the water , and the blood : and all three are in agreement .
62005009	If we take the witness of men to be true , the witness of God is greater : because this is the witness which God has given about his Son .
62005010	He who has faith in the Son of God has the witness in himself : he who has not faith in God makes him false , because he has not faith in the witness which God has given about his Son .
62005011	And his witness is this , that God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	He who has the Son has the life ; he who has not the Son of God has not the life .
62005013	I have put these things in writing for you who have faith in the name of the Son of God , so that you may be certain that you have eternal life .
62005014	And we are certain that if we make any request to him which is right in his eyes , he will give ear to us :
62005015	And if we are certain that he gives ear to all our requests , we are equally certain that we will get our requests .
62005016	If a man sees his brother doing a sin which is not bad enough for death , let him make a prayer to God , and God will give life to him whose sin was not bad enough for death . There is a sin whose punishment is death : I do not say that he may make such a request then .
62005017	All evil-doing is sin : but death is not the punishment for every sort of sin .
62005018	We are certain that one who is a child of God will do no sin , but the Son of God keeps him so that he is not touched by the Evil One .
62005019	We are certain that we are of God , but all the world is in the power of the Evil One .
62005020	And we are certain that the Son of God has come , and has given us a clear vision , so that we may see him who is true , and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . He is the true God and eternal life .
62005021	My little children , keep yourselves from false gods .
63001001	I , a ruler in the church , send word to the noble sister who is of God's selection , and to her children , for whom I have true love ; and not only I , but all who have knowledge of what is true ;
63001002	Because of this true knowledge which is in us , and will be with us for ever :
63001003	May grace , mercy , and peace be with us from God the Father , and from Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in all true love .
63001004	It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way , even as we were ordered to do by the Father .
63001005	And now , my sister , I make a request to you , not sending you a new law , but the law which we had from the first , that we have love for one another .
63001006	And love is the keeping of his laws . This is the law which was given to you from the first , so that you might keep it .
63001007	Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world , who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist .
63001008	Keep watch over yourselves , so that you do not make our work of no effect , but may get your full reward .
63001009	Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ , has not God : he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you not having this teaching , do not take him into your house or give him words of love :
63001011	For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works .
63001012	Having much to say to you , it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink : but I am hoping to come to you , and to have talk with you face to face , so that your joy may be full .
63001013	The children of your noble sister , who is of God's selection , send you their love .
64001001	I , a ruler in the church , send word to the well loved Gaius , for whom I have true love .
64001002	My loved one , it is my prayer that you may do well in all things , and be healthy in body , even as your soul does well .
64001003	For it gave me great joy when some of the brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were walking in the true way .
64001004	I have no greater joy than to have news that my children are walking in the true way .
64001005	My loved one , you are doing a good work in being kind to those brothers who come from other places ;
64001006	Who have given witness to the church of your love for them : and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for , as is right for servants of God :
64001007	For they went out for love of the Name , taking nothing from the Gentiles .
64001008	So it is right for us to take in such men as guests , so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith .
64001009	I sent a letter to the church , but Diotrephes , whose desire is ever to have the first place among them , will not have us there .
64001010	So if I come , I will keep in mind the things he does , talking against us with evil words : and as if this was not enough , he does not take the brothers into his house , and those who are ready to take them in , he keeps from doing so , putting them out of the church if they do .
64001011	My loved one , do not be copying what is evil , but what is good . He who does good is of God : he who does evil has not seen God .
64001012	Demetrius has the approval of all men and of what is true : and we give the same witness , and you are certain that our witness is true .
64001013	I had much to say to you , but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen :
64001014	But I am hoping to see you in a short time , and to have talk with you face to face .
64001015	
65001001	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James , to those of God's selection who have been made holy by God the Father and are kept safe for Jesus Christ :
65001002	May mercy and peace and love be increased in you .
65001003	My loved ones , while my thoughts were full of a letter which I was going to send you about our common salvation , it was necessary for me to send you one requesting you with all my heart to go on fighting strongly for the faith which has been given to the saints once and for ever .
65001004	For certain men have come among you secretly , marked out before in the holy Writings for this evil fate , men without the fear of God , turning his grace into an unclean thing , and false to our only Master and Lord , Jesus Christ .
65001005	Now it is my purpose to put you in mind , though you once had knowledge of all these things , of how the Lord , having taken a people safely out of Egypt , later sent destruction on those who had no faith ;
65001006	And the angels who did not keep to their kingdom but went out from the place which was theirs , he has put in eternal chains and in dark night till the great day of the judging .
65001007	Even as Sodom and Gomorrah , and the towns near them , having like these , given themselves up to unclean desires and gone after strange flesh , have been made an example , undergoing the punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	In the same way these dreamers make the flesh unclean , having no respect for authorities , and say evil of rulers .
65001009	Now when Michael , one of the chief angels , was fighting against the Evil One for the body of Moses , fearing to make use of violent words against him , he only said , May the Lord be your judge .
65001010	But these men say evil about such things as they have no knowledge of ; and the things of which they have natural knowledge , like beasts without reason , are the cause of their destruction .
65001011	A curse on them ! They have gone in the way of Cain , running uncontrolled into the error of Balaam for reward , and have come to destruction by saying evil against the Lord , like Korah .
65001012	These men are unseen rocks at your love-feasts , when they take part in them with you , keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep ; clouds without water rushing before the wind , wasted trees without fruit , twice dead , pulled up by the roots ,
65001013	Violent waves of the sea , streaming with their shame , wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever .
65001014	The prophet Enoch , who was the seventh after Adam , said of these men , The Lord came with tens of thousands of his saints ,
65001015	To be the judge of all , and to give a decision against all those whose lives are unpleasing to him , because of the evil acts which they have done , and because of all the hard things which sinners without fear of God have said against him .
65001016	These are the men who make trouble , ever desiring change , going after evil pleasures , using high-sounding words , respecting men's position in the hope of reward .
65001017	But you , my loved ones , keep in memory the words which were said before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
65001018	How they said to you , In the last days there will be men who , guided by their evil desires , will make sport of holy things .
65001019	These are the men who make divisions , natural men , not having the Spirit .
65001020	But you , my loved ones , building yourselves up on your most holy faith , and making prayers in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	Keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for life eternal through the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001022	And have pity on those who are in doubt ;
65001023	And to some give salvation , pulling them out of the fire ; and on some have mercy with fear , hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh .
65001024	Now to him who is able to keep you from falling , and to give you a place in his glory , free from all evil , with great joy ,
65001025	To the only God our Saviour , through Jesus Christ our Lord , let us give glory and honour and authority and power , before all time and now and for ever . So be it .
66001001	The Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him so that his servants might have knowledge of the things which will quickly take place : and he sent and made it clear by his angel to his servant John ;
66001002	Who gave witness of the word of God , and of the witness of Jesus Christ , even of all the things which he saw .
66001003	A blessing be on the reader , and on those who give ear to the prophet's words , and keep the things which he has put in the book : for the time is near .
66001004	John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace to you and peace , from him who is and was and is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his high seat ;
66001005	And from Jesus Christ , the true witness , the first to come back from the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To him who had love for us and has made us clean from our sins by his blood ;
66001006	And has made us to be a kingdom and priests to his God and Father ; to him let glory and power be given for ever and ever . So be it .
66001007	See , he comes with the clouds , and every eye will see him , and those by whom he was wounded ; and all the tribes of the earth will be sorrowing because of him . Yes , so be it .
66001008	I am the First and the Last , says the Lord God who is and was and is to come , the Ruler of all .
66001009	I , John , your brother , who have a part with you in the trouble and the kingdom and the quiet strength of Jesus , was in the island which is named Patmos , for the word of God and the witness of Jesus .
66001010	I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day , and a great voice at my back , as of a horn , came to my ears ,
66001011	Saying , What you see , put in a book , and send it to the seven churches ; to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea .
66001012	And turning to see the voice which said these words to me , I saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them ;
66001013	And in the middle of them one like a son of man , clothed with a robe down to his feet , and with a band of gold round his breasts .
66001014	And his head and his hair were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ;
66001015	And his feet like polished brass , as if it had been burned in a fire ; and his voice was as the sound of great waters .
66001016	And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword : and his face was like the sun shining in its strength .
66001017	And when I saw him , I went down on my face at his feet as one dead . And he put his right hand on me , saying , Have no fear ; I am the first and the last and the Living one ;
66001018	And I was dead , and see , I am living for ever , and I have the keys of death and of Hell .
66001019	Put in writing , then , the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will be after these ;
66001020	The secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven lights are the seven churches .
66002001	To the angel of the church in Ephesus say : These things says he who has the seven stars in his right hand , who is walking in the middle of the seven gold lights :
66002002	I have knowledge of your doings , and of your hard work and long waiting , and that you will not put up with evil men , and have put to the test those who say they are Apostles and are not , and have seen that they are false ;
66002003	And you have the power of waiting , and have undergone trouble because of my name , without weariness .
66002004	But I have this against you , that you are turned away from your first love .
66002005	So keep in mind where you were at first , and be changed in heart and do the first works ; or I will come to you , and will take away your light from its place , if your hearts are not changed .
66002006	But at least you have the credit of hating the works of the Nicolaitans , as I do .
66002007	He who has ears , let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who overcomes I will give of the fruit of the tree of life , which is in the Paradise of God .
66002008	And to the angel of the church in Smyrna say : These things says the first and the last , who was dead and is living :
66002009	I have knowledge of your troubles and how poor you are ( but you have true wealth ) , and the evil words of those who say they are Jews , and are not , but are a Synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Have no fear of the things which you will have to undergo : see , the Evil One will send some of you into prison , so that you may be put to the test ; and you will have great trouble for ten days . Be true till death , and I will give you the crown of life .
66002011	He who has ears , let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches . He who overcomes will not come under the power of the second death .
66002012	And to the angel of the church in Pergamos say : These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword :
66002013	I have knowledge that your living-place is where Satan has his seat : and you are true to my name , and were not turned away from your faith in me , even in the days of Antipas , my true witness , who was put to death among you , where Satan has his place .
66002014	But I have some things against you , because you have with you those who keep the teaching of Balaam , by whose suggestion Balak made the children of Israel go out of the right way , taking food which was offered to false gods , and going after the desires of the flesh .
66002015	And you have those who keep the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	See , then , that you have a change of heart ; or I will come to you quickly , and will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	He who has ears , let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches . To him who overcomes I will give of the secret manna , and I will give him a white stone , and on the stone a new name , of which no one has knowledge but he to whom it is given .
66002018	And to the angel of the church in Thyatira say : These things says the Son of God , whose eyes are like a flame of fire , and his feet like polished brass :
66002019	I have knowledge of your works , and your love and faith and help and strength in trouble , and that your last works are more than the first .
66002020	But I have this against you , that you let the woman Jezebel say she is a prophet and give false teaching , making my servants go after the desires of the flesh and take food offered to false gods .
66002021	And I gave her time for a change of heart , but she has no mind to give up her unclean ways .
66002022	See , I will put her into a bed , and those who make themselves unclean with her , into great trouble , if they go on with her works .
66002023	And I will put her children to death ; and all the churches will see that I am he who makes search into the secret thoughts and hearts of men : and I will give to every one of you the reward of your works .
66002024	But to you I say , to the rest in Thyatira , even to those who have not this teaching , and have no knowledge of the secrets of Satan , as they say ; I put on you no other weight .
66002025	But what you have , keep safe till I come .
66002026	He who overcomes , and keeps my works to the end , to him I will give rule over the nations ,
66002027	And he will be ruling them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of the potter they will be broken , even as I have power from my Father :
66002028	And I will give him the morning star .
66002029	He who has ears , let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003001	And to the angel of the church in Sardis say : These things says he who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars : I have knowledge of your works , that you seem to be living but are dead .
66003002	Be on the watch , and make strong the rest of the things which are near to death ; because as judged by me your works have not come up to God's measure .
66003003	Keep in mind , then , the teaching which was given to you , and be ruled by it and have a change of heart . If then you do not keep watch , I will come like a thief , and you will have no knowledge of the hour when I will come on you .
66003004	But you have some names in Sardis who have kept clean their robes ; and as a reward they will go in white with me .
66003005	He who overcomes will be dressed in white , and I will not take his name from the book of life , and I will give witness to his name before my Father , and before his angels .
66003006	He who has ears , let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003007	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia say : These things says he who is holy , he who is true , he who has the key of David , opening the door so that it may be shut by no one , and shutting it so that it may be open to no one .
66003008	I have knowledge of your works ( see , I have put before you an open door which may be shut by no one ) , and that you have a little strength , and have kept my word , and have been true to my name .
66003009	See , I will make those of the Synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews , and are not , but say what is false ; I will make them come and give worship before your feet , and see my love for you .
66003010	Because you have kept my word in quiet strength , I will keep you from the hour of testing which is coming on all the world , to put to the test those who are on earth .
66003011	I come quickly : keep that which you have , so that no one may take your crown .
66003012	Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the house of my God , and he will go out no more : and I will put on him the name of my God , and the name of the town of my God , the new Jerusalem , which comes down out of heaven from my God , and my new name .
66003013	He who has ears , let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003014	And to the angel of the church in Laodicea say : These things says the true and certain witness , the head of God's new order :
66003015	I have knowledge of your works , that you are not cold or warm : it would be better if you were cold or warm .
66003016	So because you are not one thing or the other , I will have no more to do with you .
66003017	For you say , I have wealth , and have got together goods and land , and have need of nothing ; and you are not conscious of your sad and unhappy condition , that you are poor and blind and without clothing .
66003018	If you are wise you will get from me gold tested by fire , so that you may have true wealth ; and white robes to put on , so that your shame may not be seen ; and oil for your eyes , so that you may see .
66003019	To all those who are dear to me , I give sharp words and punishment : then with all your heart have sorrow for your evil ways .
66003020	See , I am waiting at the door and giving the sign ; if my voice comes to any man's ears and he makes the door open , I will come in to him , and will take food with him and he with me .
66003021	To him who overcomes I will give a place with me on my high seat , even as I overcame , and am seated with my Father on his high seat .
66003022	He who has ears , let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches .
66004001	After these things I saw a door open in heaven , and the first voice came to my ears , like the sound of a horn , saying , Come up here , and I will make clear to you the things which are to come .
66004002	Straight away I was in the Spirit : and I saw a high seat in heaven , and one was seated on it ;
66004003	And to my eyes he was like a jasper and a sardius stone : and there was an arch of light round the high seat , like an emerald .
66004004	And round about the high seat were four and twenty seats : and on them I saw four and twenty rulers seated , clothed in white robes ; and on their heads crowns of gold .
66004005	And out of the high seat came flames and voices and thunders . And seven lights of fire were burning before the high seat , which are the seven Spirits of God ;
66004006	And before the high seat there was , as it seemed , a clear sea of glass ; and in the middle of the high seat , and round about it , four beasts full of eyes round about .
66004007	And the first beast was like a lion , and the second like an ox , and the third had a face like a man , and the fourth was like an eagle in flight .
66004008	And the four beasts , having every one of them six wings , are full of eyes round about and inside : and without resting day and night , they say , Holy , holy , holy , Lord God , Ruler of all , who was and is and is to come .
66004009	And when the beasts give glory and honour to him who is seated on the high seat , to him who is living for ever and ever ,
66004010	The four and twenty rulers go down on their faces before him who is seated on the high seat , and give worship to him who is living for ever and ever , and take off their crowns before the high seat , saying ,
66004011	It is right , our Lord and our God , for you to have glory and honour and power : because by you were all things made , and by your desire they came into being .
66005001	And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat , a book with writing inside it and on the back , shut with seven stamps of wax .
66005002	And I saw a strong angel saying in a loud voice , Who is able to make the book open , and to undo its stamps ?
66005003	And no one in heaven , or on the earth , or under the earth , was able to get the book open , or to see what was in it .
66005004	And I was very sad , because there was no one able to get the book open or to see what was in it .
66005005	And one of the rulers said to me , Do not be sad : see , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has overcome , and has power to undo the book and its seven stamps .
66005006	And I saw in the middle of the high seat and of the four beasts , and in the middle of the rulers , a Lamb in his place , which seemed as if it had been put to death , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God , sent out into all the earth .
66005007	And he came and took it out of the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat .
66005008	And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and the four and twenty rulers went down on their faces before the Lamb , having every one an instrument of music , and gold vessels full of perfumes , which are the prayers of the saints .
66005009	And their voices are sounding in a new song , saying , It is right for you to take the book and to make it open : for you were put to death and have made an offering to God of your blood for men of every tribe , and language , and people , and nation ,
66005010	And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God , and they are ruling on the earth .
66005011	And I saw , and there came to my ears the sound of a great number of angels round about the high seat and the beasts and the rulers ; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
66005012	Saying with a great voice , It is right to give to the Lamb who was put to death , power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing .
66005013	And to my ears came the voice of everything in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea , and of all things which are in them , saying , To him who is seated on the high seat , and to the Lamb , may blessing and honour and glory and power be given for ever and ever .
66005014	And the four beasts said , So be it . And the rulers went down on their faces and gave worship .
66006001	And I saw when the Lamb undid one of the stamps , and the voice of one of the four beasts came to my ears , saying as with a voice of thunder , Come and see .
66006002	And I saw a white horse , and he who was seated on it had a bow ; and there was given to him a crown : and he went out with power to overcome .
66006003	And when the second stamp was undone , the voice of the second beast came to my ears , saying , Come and see .
66006004	And another horse came out , a red horse ; and it was given to him who was seated on it to take peace from the earth , so that people might put one another to death : and there was given to him a great sword .
66006005	And when the third stamp was undone , the voice of the third beast came to my ears , saying , Come and see . And I saw a black horse ; and he who was seated on it had scales in his hand .
66006006	And a voice came to my ears , from the middle of the four beasts , saying , A measure of grain for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny : and see that you do no damage to the oil and the wine .
66006007	And when the fourth stamp was undone , the voice of the fourth beast came to my ears , saying , Come and see .
66006008	And I saw a grey horse , and the name of him who was seated on it was Death ; and Hell came after him . And there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth , to put to destruction by the sword , and by taking away their food , and by death , and by the beasts of the earth .
66006009	And when the fifth stamp was undone , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for the word of God , and for the witness which they kept .
66006010	And they gave a great cry , saying , How long will it be , O Ruler , holy and true , before you take your place as judge and give punishment for our blood to those on the earth ?
66006011	And there was given to every one a white robe , and they were ordered to take their rest for a little time , till the number was complete of the other servants , their brothers , who would be put to death , even as they had been .
66006012	And I saw when the sixth stamp was undone , and there was a great earth-shock ; and the sun became black as haircloth , and all the moon became as blood ;
66006013	And the stars of heaven were falling to the earth , like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind .
66006014	And the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up ; and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places .
66006015	And the kings of the earth , and the rulers , and the chief captains , and the men of wealth , and the strong , and every servant and free man , took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains ;
66006016	And they say to the mountains and to the rocks , Come down on us , covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat , and from the wrath of the Lamb :
66006017	For the great day of their wrath is come , and who may keep his place ?
66007001	After this I saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth , keeping back the four winds in their hands , so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
66007002	And I saw another angel coming up from the east , having the mark of the living God : and he said with a great voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to do damage to the earth and the sea ,
66007003	Do no damage to the earth , or the sea , or the trees , till we have put a mark on the servants of our God .
66007004	And there came to my ears the number of those who had the mark on their brows , a hundred and forty-four thousand , who were marked out of every tribe of the people of Israel .
66007005	Of the tribe of Judah were marked twelve thousand : of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand : of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand :
66007006	Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand : of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand : of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand :
66007007	Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand : of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand : of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand :
66007008	Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand : of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand : of the tribe of Benjamin were marked twelve thousand .
66007009	After these things I saw a great army of people more than might be numbered , out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and languages , taking their places before the high seat and before the Lamb , dressed in white robes , and with branches in their hands ,
66007010	Saying with a loud voice , Salvation to our God who is seated on the high seat , and to the Lamb .
66007011	And all the angels were round about the high seat , and about the rulers and the four beasts ; and they went down on their faces before the high seat , and gave worship to God , saying ,
66007012	So be it . Let blessing and glory and wisdom and praise and honour and power and strength be given to our God for ever and ever . So be it .
66007013	And one of the rulers made answer , saying to me , These who have on white robes , who are they , and where did they come from ?
66007014	And I said to him , My lord , you have knowledge . And he said to me , These are they who came through the great testing , and their robes have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	This is why they are before the high seat of God ; and they are his servants day and night in his house : and he who is seated on the high seat will be a tent over them .
66007016	They will never be in need of food or drink : and they will never again be troubled by the burning heat of the sun :
66007017	For the Lamb who is on the high seat will be their keeper and their guide to fountains of living water : and God will make glad their eyes for ever .
66008001	And when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	And I saw the seven angels who had their place before God ; and seven horns were given to them .
66008003	And another angel came and took his place at the altar , having a gold vessel for burning perfume ; and there was given to him much perfume , so that he might put it with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar which was before the high seat .
66008004	And the smoke of the perfume , with the prayers of the saints , went up before God out of the angel's hand .
66008005	And the angel took the vessel ; and he made it full of the fire of the altar , and sent it down on the earth : and there came thunders and voices and flames and a shaking of the earth .
66008006	And the seven angels who had the seven horns made ready for sounding them .
66008007	And at the sounding of the first , a rain of ice and fire , mixed with blood , was sent on the earth : and a third part of the earth , and of the trees , and all green grass was burned up .
66008008	And at the sounding of the second angel , it was as if a great mountain burning with fire was sent into the sea : and a third part of the sea became blood ,
66008009	And destruction came on a third part of the living things which were in the sea , and on a third part of the ships .
66008010	And at the sounding of the third angel , there went down from heaven a great star , burning like a flame , and it came on a third part of the rivers , and on the fountains of water .
66008011	And the name of the star is Wormwood : and a third part of the waters became bitter ; and a number of men came to their end because of the waters , for they were made bitter .
66008012	And at the sounding of the fourth angel , a third part of the sun , and of the moon , and of the stars was made dark , so that there was no light for a third part of the day and of the night .
66008013	And there came to my ears the cry of an eagle in flight in the middle of heaven , saying with a great voice , Trouble , trouble , trouble , to all on the earth , because of the other voices of the horns of the three angels , whose sounding is still to come .
66009001	And at the sounding of the fifth angel I saw a star falling from heaven to the earth : and there was given to him the key of the great deep .
66009002	And he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it , like the smoke of a great oven ; and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke .
66009003	And from the smoke locusts came out on the earth ; and power was given them , like the power of scorpions .
66009004	And they were ordered to do no damage to the grass of the earth , or any green thing , or any tree , but only to such men as have not the mark of God on their brows .
66009005	And orders were given them not to put them to death , but to give them great pain for five months : and their pain was as the pain from the wound of a scorpion .
66009006	And in those days men will be hoping for death , and it will not come to them ; and they will have a great desire for death , and death will go in flight from them .
66009007	And the forms of the locusts were like horses made ready for war ; and on their heads they had crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
66009008	And they had hair like the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
66009009	And they had breastplates like iron , and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages , like an army of horses rushing to the fight .
66009010	And they have pointed tails like scorpions ; and in their tails is their power to give men wounds for five months .
66009011	They have over them as king the angel of the great deep : his name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in the Greek language Apollyon .
66009012	The first Trouble is past : see , there are still two Troubles to come .
66009013	And at the sounding of the sixth angel a voice came to my ears from the horns of the gold altar which is before God ,
66009014	Saying to the sixth angel who had the horn , Make free the four angels who are chained at the great river Euphrates .
66009015	And the four angels were made free , who were ready for the hour and day and month and year , that they might put to death a third part of men .
66009016	And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand : the number of them came to my ears .
66009017	And so I saw the horses in the vision , and those who were seated on them , having breastplates of fire and glass and of burning stone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and a smell of burning .
66009018	By these evils a third part of men was put to death , by the fire , and the smoke , and the burning smell which came out of their mouths .
66009019	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails : because their tails are like snakes , and have heads , and with them they give wounds .
66009020	And the rest of the people , who were not put to death by these evils , were not turned from the works of their hands , but went on giving worship to evil spirits , and images of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which have no power of seeing or hearing or walking :
66009021	And they had no regret for putting men to death , or for their use of secret arts , or for the evil desires of the flesh , or for taking the property of others .
66010001	And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven , clothed with a cloud ; and an arch of coloured light was round his head , and his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire ;
66010002	And he had in his hand a little open book : and he put his right foot on the sea , and his left on the earth ;
66010003	And he gave a loud cry , like the angry voice of a lion : and at his cry the voices of the seven thunders were sounding .
66010004	And when the seven thunders had given out their voices , I was about to put their words down : and a voice from heaven came to my ears , saying , Keep secret the things which the seven thunders said , and do not put them in writing .
66010005	And the angel which I saw taking his position on the sea and on the earth , put up his right hand to heaven ,
66010006	And took his oath by him who is living for ever and ever , who made the heaven and the things in it , and the earth and the things in it , and the sea and the things in it , that there would be no more waiting :
66010007	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when the sound of his horn is about to come , then will the secret of God be complete , of which he gave the good news to his servants the prophets .
66010008	And the voice came to me again from heaven , saying , Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who has his place on the sea and on the earth .
66010009	And I went to the angel , and said to him , Give me the little book . And he said to me : Put it in your mouth ; and it will make your stomach bitter , but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey .
66010010	And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and did as he said ; and it was sweet as honey in my mouth : and when I had taken it , my stomach was made bitter .
66010011	And they said to me , You are to give word again of what is coming in the future to the peoples and nations and languages and kings .
66011001	And there was given to me a measuring rod : and one said , Go up and take the measure of the house of God , and the altar , and the worshippers in it .
66011002	But do not take the measure of the space outside the house ; because it has been given to the nations : and the holy town will be under their feet for forty-two months .
66011003	And I will give orders to my two witnesses , and they will be prophets for a thousand , two hundred and sixty days , clothed with haircloth .
66011004	These are the two olive-trees and the two lights , which are before the Lord of the earth .
66011005	And if any man would do them damage , fire comes out of their mouth and puts an end to those who are working against them : and if any man has a desire to do them damage , in this way will he be put to death .
66011006	These have the power to keep the heaven shut , so that there may be no rain in the days when they are prophets : and they have power over the waters to make them into blood , and to send every sort of disease on the earth as their pleasure is .
66011007	And when they have come to the end of their witness , the beast which comes up out of the great deep will make war on them and overcome them and put them to death .
66011008	And their dead bodies will be in the open street of the great town , which in the spirit is named Sodom and Egypt , where their Lord was put to death on the cross .
66011009	And the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will be looking on their dead bodies three days and a half , and will not let their dead bodies be put in the earth .
66011010	And those who are on the earth will have pleasure and delight over them ; and they will send offerings one to another because these two prophets gave great trouble to all on the earth .
66011011	And after three days and a half the breath of life from God went into them , and they got up on their feet ; and great fear came on those who saw them .
66011012	And a great voice from heaven came to their ears , saying to them , Come up here . And they went up into heaven in the cloud , and were seen by those desiring their death .
66011013	And in that hour there was a great earth-shock and a tenth part of the town came to destruction ; and in the earth-shock seven thousand persons came to their end : and the rest were in fear , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second Trouble is past : see , the third Trouble comes quickly .
66011015	And at the sounding of the seventh angel there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ , and he will have rule for ever and ever .
66011016	And the four and twenty rulers , who are seated before God on their high seats , went down on their faces and gave worship to God , saying ,
66011017	We give you praise , O Lord God , Ruler of all , who is and who was ; because you have taken up your great power and are ruling your kingdom .
66011018	And the nations were angry , and your wrath has come , and the time for the dead to be judged , and the time of reward for your servants , the prophets , and for the saints , and for those in whom is the fear of your name , small and great , and the time of destruction for those who made the earth unclean .
66011019	And the house of God which is in heaven was open ; and the ark of his agreement was seen in his house , and there were flames and voices and thunders and an earth-shock and a rain of ice .
66012001	And a great sign was seen in heaven : a A woman clothed with the sun , and with the moon under her feet , and on her head a crown of twelve stars .
66012002	And she was with child ; and she gave a cry , in the pains of childbirth .
66012003	And there was seen another sign in heaven ; a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads seven crowns .
66012004	And his tail was pulling a third part of the stars of heaven down to the earth , and the dragon took his place before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when the birth had taken place he might put an end to her child .
66012005	And she gave birth to a son , a male child , who was to have rule over all the nations with a rod of iron : and her child was taken up to God and to his high seat .
66012006	And the woman went in flight to the waste land , where she has a place made ready by God , so that there they may give her food a thousand , two hundred and sixty days .
66012007	And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels going out to the fight with the dragon ; and the dragon and his angels made war ,
66012008	And they were overcome , and there was no more place for them in heaven .
66012009	And the great dragon was forced down , the old snake , who is named the Evil One and Satan , by whom all the earth is turned from the right way ; he was forced down to the earth , and his angels were forced down with him .
66012010	And a great voice in heaven came to my ears , saying , Now is come the salvation , and the power , and the kingdom of our God , and the authority of his Christ : because he who says evil against our brothers before our God day and night is forced down .
66012011	And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and the word of their witness ; and loving not their lives they freely gave themselves up to death .
66012012	Be glad then , O heavens , and you who are in them . But there is trouble for the earth and the sea : because the Evil One has come down to you , being very angry , having the knowledge that he has but a short time .
66012013	And when the dragon saw that he was forced down to the earth , he made cruel attacks on the woman who gave birth to the male child .
66012014	And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle , so that she might go in flight into the waste land , to her place , where she is given food for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the snake .
66012015	And the snake sent out of his mouth after the woman a river of water , so that she might be taken away by the stream .
66012016	And the earth gave help to the woman , and with open mouth took up the river which the dragon sent out of his mouth .
66012017	And the dragon was angry with the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her seed , who keep the orders of God , and the witness of Jesus :
66013001	And he took his place on the sand of the sea . And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads , and on his horns ten crowns , and on his heads unholy names .
66013002	And the beast which I saw was like a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority .
66013003	And I saw one of his heads as if it had been given a death-wound ; and his death-wound was made well : and all the earth was wondering at the beast .
66013004	And they gave worship to the dragon , because he gave authority to the beast ; and worshipping the beast , they said , Who is like the beast ? and who is able to go to war with him ?
66013005	And there was given to him a mouth to say words of pride against God ; and there was given to him authority to go on for forty-two months .
66013006	And his mouth was open to say evil against God , and against his name and his Tent , even against those who are in heaven .
66013007	And it was given to him to make war on the saints and to overcome them : and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and language and nation .
66013008	And all who are on the earth will give him worship , everyone whose name has not been from the first in the book of life of the Lamb who was put to death .
66013009	If any man has ears , let him give ear .
66013010	If any man sends others into prison , into prison he will go : if any man puts to death with the sword , with the sword will he be put to death . Here is the quiet strength and the faith of the saints .
66013011	And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and his voice was like that of a dragon .
66013012	And he makes use of all the authority of the first beast before his eyes . And he makes the earth and those who are in it give worship to the first beast , whose death-wound was made well .
66013013	And he does great signs , even making fire come down from heaven on the earth before the eyes of men .
66013014	And those who are on the earth are turned from the true way by him through the signs which he was given power to do before the beast ; giving orders to those who are on the earth to make an image to the beast , who was wounded by the sword , and came to life .
66013015	And he had power to give breath to the image of the beast , so that words might come from the image of the beast , and that he might have all those who did not give worship to the image of the beast put to death .
66013016	And he gives to all , small and great , the poor and those who have wealth , the free and those who are not free , a mark on their right hand or on their brows ;
66013017	So that no man might be able to do trade but he who has the mark , even the name of the beast or the number of his name .
66013018	Here is wisdom . He who has knowledge let him get the number of the beast ; because it is the number of a man : and his number is Six hundred and sixty-six .
66014001	And I saw the Lamb on the mountain of Zion , and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand , marked on their brows with his name and the name of his Father .
66014002	And a voice from heaven came to my ears , like the sound of great waters , and the sound of loud thunder : and the voice which came to me was like the sound of players , playing on instruments of music .
66014003	And they made as it seemed a new song before the high seat , and before the four beasts and the rulers : and no man might have knowledge of the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand , even those from the earth whom God has made his for a price .
66014004	These are they who have not made themselves unclean with women ; for they are virgins . These are they who go after the Lamb wherever he goes . These were taken from among men to be the first fruits to God and to the Lamb .
66014005	And in their mouth there was no false word , for they are untouched by evil .
66014006	And I saw another angel in flight between heaven and earth , having eternal good news to give to those who are on the earth , and to every nation and tribe and language and people ,
66014007	Saying with a loud voice , Have fear of God and give him glory ; because the hour of his judging is come ; and give worship to him who made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water .
66014008	And a second angel came after , saying , Destruction has come to Babylon the great , which gave to all the nations the wine of the wrath of her evil ways .
66014009	And a third angel came after them , saying with a loud voice , If any man gives worship to the beast and his image , and has his mark on his brow or on his hand ,
66014010	To him will be given of the wine of God's wrath which is ready unmixed in the cup of his wrath and he will have cruel pain , burning with fire before the holy angels and before the Lamb :
66014011	And the smoke of their pain goes up for ever and ever ; and they have no rest day and night , who give worship to the beast and his image , and have on them the mark of his name .
66014012	Here is the quiet strength of the saints , who keep the orders of God , and the faith of Jesus .
66014013	And a voice from heaven came to my ears , saying , Put in writing , There is a blessing on the dead who from now on come to their end in the Lord : yes , says the Spirit , that they may have rest from their troubles ; for their works go with them .
66014014	And I saw a white cloud , and on the cloud I saw one seated , like a son of man , having on his head a crown of gold , and in his hand a sharp curved blade .
66014015	And another angel came out from the house of God , crying with a loud voice to him who was seated on the cloud , Put in your blade , and let the grain be cut : because the hour for cutting it is come ; for the grain of the earth is over-ready .
66014016	And he who was seated on the cloud sent in his blade on the earth ; and the grain of the earth was cut .
66014017	And another angel came out from the house of God which is in heaven , having a sharp curved blade .
66014018	And another angel came out from the altar , who has power over fire ; and he gave a loud cry to him who had the sharp curved blade , saying , Put in your sharp blade , and let the grapes of the vine of the earth be cut ; for her grapes are fully ready .
66014019	And the angel sent his blade into the earth , and the vine of the earth was cut , and he put it into the great wine-crusher of the wrath of God .
66014020	And the grapes were crushed under foot outside the town , and blood came out from them , even to the head-bands of the horses , two hundred miles .
66015001	And I saw another sign in heaven , great and strange ; seven angels having the seven last punishments , for in them the wrath of God is complete .
66015002	And I saw a sea which seemed like glass mixed with fire ; and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name , were in their places by the sea of glass , with God's instruments of music in their hands .
66015003	And they give the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and full of wonder are your works , O Lord God , Ruler of all ; true and full of righteousness are your ways , eternal King .
66015004	What man is there who will not have fear before you , O Lord , and give glory to your name ? because you only are holy ; for all the nations will come and give worship before you ; for your righteousness has been made clear .
66015005	And after these things I saw , and the house of the Tent of witness in heaven was open :
66015006	And the seven angels who had the seven punishments came out from the house of God , clothed with linen , clean and bright and with bands of gold about their breasts .
66015007	And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven gold vessels full of the wrath of God , who is living for ever and ever .
66015008	And the house of God was full of smoke from the glory of God , and from his power , and no one was able to go into the house of God , till the seven punishments of the seven angels were ended .
66016001	And a great voice out of the house of God came to my ears , saying to the seven angels , Go , and let that which is in the seven vessels of the wrath of God come down on the earth .
66016002	And the first went , and let what was in his vessel come down on the earth ; and it became an evil poisoning wound on the men who had the mark of the beast , and who gave worship to his image .
66016003	And the second let what was in his vessel come out into the sea ; and it became blood as of a dead man ; and every living thing in the sea came to an end .
66016004	And the third let what was in his vessel come out into the rivers and the fountains of water ; and they became blood .
66016005	And the voice of the angel of the waters came to my ears , saying , True and upright is your judging , O Holy One , who is and was from all time :
66016006	For they made the blood of saints and prophets come out like a stream , and blood have you given them for drink ; which is their right reward .
66016007	And a voice came from the altar , saying , Even so , O Lord God , Ruler of all , true and full of righteousness is your judging .
66016008	And the fourth let what was in his vessel come out on the sun ; and power was given to it that men might be burned with fire .
66016009	And men were burned with great heat : and they said evil things against the name of the God who has authority over these punishments ; and they were not turned from their evil ways to give him glory .
66016010	And the fifth let what was in his vessel come out on the high seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was made dark ; and they were biting their tongues for pain .
66016011	And they said evil things against the God of heaven because of their pain and their wounds ; and they were not turned from their evil works .
66016012	And the sixth let what was in his vessel come out on the great river Euphrates ; and it became dry , so that the way might be made ready for the kings from the east .
66016013	And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet , three unclean spirits , like frogs .
66016014	For they are evil spirits , working signs ; who go out even to the kings of all the earth , to get them together to the war of the great day of God , the Ruler of all .
66016015	( See , I come as a thief . Happy is he who is watching and keeps his robes , so that he may not go unclothed , and his shame be seen . )
66016016	And they got them together into the place which is named in Hebrew Armageddon .
66016017	And the seventh let what was in his vessel come out on the air ; and there came out a great voice from the house of God , from the high seat , saying , It is done .
66016018	And there were flames and voices and thunders ; and there was a great earth-shock so that never , from the time when men were on the earth , had there been so great an earth-shock , so full of power .
66016019	And the great town was cut into three parts , and the towns of the nations came to destruction : and Babylon the great came into mind before God , to be given the cup of the wine of his wrath .
66016020	And every island went in flight , and the mountains were seen no longer .
66016021	And great drops of ice , every one about the weight of a talent , came down out of heaven on men : and men said evil things against God because of the punishment of the ice-drops ; for it is very great .
66017001	And one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels came and said to me , Come here , so that you may see the judging of the evil woman who is seated on the great waters ;
66017002	With whom the kings of the earth made themselves unclean , and those who are on the earth were full of the wine of her evil desires .
66017003	And he took me away in the Spirit into a waste land : and I saw a woman seated on a bright red beast , full of evil names , having seven heads and ten horns ,
66017004	And the woman was clothed in purple and bright red , with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels ; and in her hand was a gold cup full of evil things and her unclean desires ;
66017005	And on her brow was a name , SECRET , BABYLON THE GREAT , THE MOTHER OF THE EVIL WOMEN AND OF THE UNCLEAN THINGS OF THE EARTH .
66017006	And I saw the woman overcome as with the wine of the blood of the saints , and the blood of those put to death because of Jesus . And when I saw her , I was overcome with a great wonder .
66017007	And the angel said to me , Why were you surprised ? I will make clear to you the secret of the woman , and of the beast on which she is seated , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
66017008	The beast which you saw was , and is not ; and is about to come up out of the great deep , and to go into destruction . And those who are on the earth , whose names have not been put in the book of life from the first , will be full of wonder when they see the beast , that he was , and is not , and still will be .
66017009	Here is the mind which has wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains , on which the woman is seated :
66017010	And they are seven kings ; the five have come to an end , the one is , the other has not come ; and when he comes , he will have to go on for a little time .
66017011	And the beast which was , and is not , is himself the eighth , and is of the seven ; and he goes into destruction .
66017012	And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings , which still have been given no kingdom ; but they are given authority as kings , with the beast , for one hour .
66017013	These have one mind , and they give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	These will make war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will overcome them , because he is the Lord of lords and King of kings ; and those who are with him are named , marked out , and true .
66017015	And he said to me , The waters which you saw , where the evil woman is seated , are peoples , and armies , and nations and languages .
66017016	And the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will be turned against the evil woman , and will make her waste and uncovered , and will take her flesh for food , and will have her burned with fire .
66017017	Because God has put it in their hearts to do his purpose , and to be of one mind , giving their kingdom to the beast , till the words of God have effect and are complete .
66017018	And the woman whom you saw is the great town , which is ruling over the kings of the earth .
66018001	After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven , having great authority ; and the earth was bright with his glory .
66018002	And he gave a loud cry , saying , Babylon the great has come down from her high place , she has come to destruction and has become a place of evil spirits , and of every unclean spirit , and a hole for every unclean and hated bird .
66018003	For through the wine of the wrath of her evil desires all the nations have come to destruction ; and the kings of the earth made themselves unclean with her , and the traders of the earth had their wealth increased by the power of her evil ways .
66018004	And another voice from heaven came to my ears , saying , Come out of her , my people , so that you may have no part in her sins and in her punishments .
66018005	For her sins have gone up even to heaven , and God has taken note of her evil-doing .
66018006	Give to her as she gave , even an increased reward for her works ; in the cup which was mixed by her , let there be mixed as much again for herself .
66018007	As she gave glory to herself , and became more evil in her ways , in the same measure give her pain and weeping : for she says in her heart , I am seated here a queen , and am no widow , and will in no way see sorrow .
66018008	For this reason in one day will her troubles come , death and sorrow and need of food ; and she will be completely burned with fire ; for strong is the Lord God who is her judge .
66018009	And the kings of the earth , who made themselves unclean with her , and in her company gave themselves up to evil , will be weeping and crying over her , when they see the smoke of her burning ,
66018010	Watching from far away , for fear of her punishment , saying , Sorrow , sorrow for Babylon , the great town , the strong town ! for in one hour you have been judged .
66018011	And the traders of the earth are weeping and crying over her , because no man has any more desire for their goods ,
66018012	Gold , and silver , and stones of great price , and jewels , and delicate linen , and robes of purple and silk and red ; and perfumed wood , and every vessel of ivory , and every vessel made of fair wood , and of brass , and iron , and stone ;
66018013	And sweet-smelling plants , and perfumes , and wine , and oil , and well crushed grain , and cattle and sheep ; and horses and carriages and servants ; and souls of men .
66018014	And the fruit of your soul's desire has gone from you , and all things delicate and shining have come to an end and will never again be seen .
66018015	The traders in these things , by which their wealth was increased , will be watching far off for fear of her punishment , weeping and crying ;
66018016	Saying , Sorrow , sorrow for the great town , she who was clothed in delicate linen , and purple , and red ; with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels !
66018017	For in one hour such great wealth has come to nothing . And every shipmaster , and all who are sailing on the sea , and sailors and all who get their living by the sea , were watching from far away ,
66018018	And crying out when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , What town is like the great town ?
66018019	And they put dust on their heads , and were sad , weeping and crying , and saying , Sorrow , sorrow for the great town , in which was increased the wealth of all who had their ships on the sea because of her great stores ! for in one hour she is made waste .
66018020	Be glad over her , heaven , and you saints , and Apostles , and prophets ; because she has been judged by God on your account .
66018021	And a strong angel took up a stone like the great stone with which grain is crushed , and sent it into the sea , saying , So , with a great fall , will Babylon , the great town , come to destruction , and will not be seen any more at all .
66018022	And the voice of players and makers of music will never again be sounding in you : and no worker , expert in art , will ever again be living in you ; and there will be no sound of the crushing of grain any more at all in you ;
66018023	And never again will the shining of lights be seen in you ; and the voice of the newly-married man and the bride will never again be sounding in you : for your traders were the lords of the earth , and by your evil powers were all the nations turned out of the right way .
66018024	And in her was seen the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all who have been put to death on the earth .
66019001	After these things there came to my ears a sound like the voice of a great band of people in heaven , saying , Praise to the Lord ; salvation and glory and power be to our God :
66019002	For true and upright are his decisions ; for by him has the evil woman been judged , who made the earth unclean with the sins of her body ; and he has given her punishment for the blood of his servants .
66019003	And again they said , Praise to the Lord . And her smoke went up for ever and ever .
66019004	And the four and twenty rulers and the four beasts went down on their faces and gave worship to God who was seated on the high seat , saying , Even so , praise to the Lord .
66019005	And a voice came from the high seat , saying , Give praise to our God , all you his servants , small and great , in whom is the fear of him .
66019006	And there came to my ears the voice of a great army , like the sound of waters , and the sound of loud thunders , saying , Praise to the Lord : for the Lord our God , Ruler of all , is King .
66019007	Let us be glad with delight , and let us give glory to him : because the time is come for the Lamb to be married , and his wife has made herself ready .
66019008	And to her it was given to be clothed in delicate linen , clean and shining : for the clean linen is the righteousness of the saints .
66019009	And he said to me , Put in the book , Happy are the guests at the bride-feast of the Lamb . And he said to me , These are the true words of God .
66019010	And I went on my face before his feet to give him worship . And he said to me , See you do it not : I am a brother-servant with you and with your brothers who keep the witness of Jesus : give worship to God : for the witness of Jesus is the spirit of the prophet's word .
66019011	And the heaven was open ; and I saw a white horse , and he who was seated on it was named Certain and True ; and he is judging and making war in righteousness .
66019012	And his eyes are a flame of fire , and crowns are on his head ; and he has a name in writing , of which no man has knowledge but himself .
66019013	And he is clothed in a robe washed with blood : and his name is The Word of God .
66019014	And the armies which are in heaven went after him on white horses , clothed in delicate linen , white and clean .
66019015	And out of his mouth comes a sharp sword , with which he overcomes the nations : and he has rule over them with a rod of iron : and he is crushing with his feet the grapes of the strong wrath of God the Ruler of all .
66019016	And on his robe and on his leg is a name , KING OF KINGS , AND LORD OF LORDS .
66019017	And I saw an angel taking his place in the sun ; and he was crying with a loud voice , saying to all the birds in flight in the heavens , Come together to the great feast of God ;
66019018	So that you may take for your food the flesh of kings , and of captains , and of strong men , and of horses and of those who are seated on them , and the flesh of all men , free and unfree , small and great .
66019019	And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , come together to make war against him who was seated on the horse and against his army .
66019020	And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him , by which they were turned from the true way who had the mark of the beast , and who gave worship to his image : these two were put living into the sea of ever-burning fire .
66019021	And the rest were put to death with the sword of him who was on the horse , even the sword which came out of his mouth : and all the birds were made full with their flesh .
66020001	And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven , having the key of the great deep and a great chain in his hand .
66020002	And he took the dragon , the old snake , which is the Evil One and Satan , and put chains on him for a thousand years ,
66020003	And put him into the great deep , and it was shut and locked over him , so that he might put the nations in error no longer , till the thousand years were ended : after this he will be let loose for a little time .
66020004	And I saw high seats , and they were seated on them , and the right of judging was given to them : and I saw the souls of those who were put to death for the witness of Jesus , and for the word of God , and those who did not give worship to the beast , or to his image , and had not his mark on their brows or on their hands ; and they were living and ruling with Christ a thousand years .
66020005	The rest of the dead did not come to life again till the thousand years were ended . This is the first coming back from the dead .
66020006	Happy and holy is he who has a part in this first coming : over these the second death has no authority , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will be ruling with him a thousand years .
66020007	And when the thousand years are ended , Satan will be let loose out of his prison ,
66020008	And will go out to put in error the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to get them together to the war , the number of whom is like the sands of the sea .
66020009	And they went up over the face of the earth , and made a circle about the tents of the saints , and the well loved town : and fire came down out of heaven for their destruction .
66020010	And the Evil One who put them in error was sent down into the sea of ever-burning fire , where the beast and the false prophet are , and their punishment will go on day and night for ever and ever .
66020011	And I saw a great white seat , and him who was seated on it , before whose face the earth and the heaven went in flight ; and there was no place for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , great and small , taking their places before the high seat ; and the books were open , and another book was open , which is the book of life ; and the dead were judged by the things which were in the books , even by their works .
66020013	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and Hell gave up the dead which were in them ; and they were judged every man by his works .
66020014	And death and Hell were put into the sea of fire . This is the second death , even the sea of fire .
66020015	And if anyone's name was not in the book of life , he went down into the sea of fire .
66021001	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were gone ; and there was no more sea .
66021002	And I saw the holy town , new Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , like a bride made beautiful for her husband .
66021003	And there came to my ears a great voice out of the high seat , saying , See , the Tent of God is with men , and he will make his living-place with them , and they will be his people , and God himself will be with them , and be their God .
66021004	And he will put an end to all their weeping ; and there will be no more death , or sorrow , or crying , or pain ; for the first things have come to an end .
66021005	And he who is seated on the high seat said , See , I make all things new . And he said , Put it in the book ; for these words are certain and true .
66021006	And he said to me , It is done . I am the First and the Last , the start and the end . I will freely give of the fountain of the water of life to him who is in need .
66021007	He who overcomes will have these things for his heritage ; and I will be his God , and he will be my son .
66021008	But those who are full of fear and without faith , the unclean and takers of life , those who do the sins of the flesh , and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images , and all those who are false , will have their part in the sea of ever-burning fire which is the second death .
66021009	And one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels in which were the seven last punishments , came and said to me , Come here , and see the bride , the Lamb's wife .
66021010	And he took me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain , and let me see the holy town Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God ,
66021011	Having the glory of God : and her light was like a stone of great price , a jasper stone , clear as glass :
66021012	She had a wall great and high , with twelve doors , and at the doors twelve angels ; and names on them , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel .
66021013	And on the east were three doors ; and on the north three doors ; and on the south three doors ; and on the west three doors .
66021014	And the wall of the town had twelve bases , and on them the twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	And he who was talking with me had a gold measuring-rod to take the measure of the town , and of its doors , and its wall .
66021016	And the town is square , as wide as it is long ; and he took the measure of the town with the rod , one thousand and five hundred miles : it is equally long and wide and high .
66021017	And he took the measure of its wall , one hundred and forty-four cubits , after the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
66021018	And the building of its wall was of jasper , and the town was clear gold , clear as glass .
66021019	The bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones . The first base was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , chalcedony ; the fourth , emerald ;
66021020	The fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolite ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , topaz ; the tenth , chrysoprase ; the eleventh , jacinth ; the twelfth , amethyst .
66021021	And the twelve doors were twelve pearls ; every door was made of one pearl ; and the street of the town was clear gold , as clear as glass .
66021022	And I saw no Temple there ; because the Lord God , the Ruler of all , and the Lamb are its Temple .
66021023	And the town has no need of the sun , or of the moon , to give it light : for the glory of God did make it light , and the light of it is the Lamb .
66021024	And the nations will go in its light : and the kings of the earth will take their glory into it .
66021025	And the doors of it will never be shut by day ( for there is no night there ) :
66021026	And the glory and honour of the nations will come into it :
66021027	And nothing unclean may come into it , or anyone whose works are cursed or false ; but only those whose names are in the Lamb's book of life .
66022001	And I saw a river of water of life , clear as glass , coming out of the high seat of God and of the Lamb ,
66022002	In the middle of its street . And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , having twelve sorts of fruits , giving its fruit every month ; and the leaves of the tree give life to the nations .
66022003	And there will be no more curse : and the high seat of God and of the Lamb will be there ; and his servants will be worshipping him ;
66022004	And they will see his face ; and his name will be on their brows .
66022005	And there will be no more night ; and they have no need of a light or of the shining of the sun ; for the Lord God will give them light : and they will be ruling for ever and ever .
66022006	And he said to me , These words are certain and true : and the Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , sent his angel to make clear to his servants the things which are now to come about .
66022007	See , I come quickly . A blessing on him who keeps the words of this book of the prophet .
66022008	And I , John , am he who saw these things and to whose ears they came . And when I had seen and given ear , I went down on my face to give worship at the feet of the angel who made these things clear to me .
66022009	And he said to me , See you do it not ; I am a brother-servant with you and with your brothers the prophets , and with those who keep the words of this book : give worship to God .
66022010	And he said to me , Let not the words of this prophet's book be kept secret , because the time is near .
66022011	Let the evil man go on in his evil : and let the unclean be still unclean : and let the upright go on in his righteousness : and let the holy be holy still .
66022012	See , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give to every man the outcome of his works .
66022013	I am the First and the Last , the start and the end .
66022014	A blessing on those whose robes are washed , so that they may have a right to the tree of life , and may go in by the doors into the town .
66022015	Outside are the dogs , and those who make use of evil powers , those who make themselves unclean , and the takers of life , and those who give worship to images , and everyone whose delight is in what is false .
66022016	I , Jesus , have sent my angel to give witness to you of these things in the churches . I am the root and the offspring of David , the bright and morning star .
66022017	And the Spirit and the bride say , Come . And let him who gives ear , say , Come . And let him who is in need come ; and let everyone desiring it take of the water of life freely .
66022018	For I say to every man to whose ears have come the words of this prophet's book , If any man makes an addition to them , God will put on him the punishments which are in this book :
66022019	And if any man takes away from the words of this book , God will take away from him his part in the tree of life and the holy town , even the things which are in this book .
66022020	He who gives witness to these things says , Truly , I come quickly . Even so come , Lord Jesus .
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints . So be it .
