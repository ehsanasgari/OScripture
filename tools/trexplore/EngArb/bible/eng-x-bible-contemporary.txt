40001001	Jesus Christ came from the family of King David and also from the family of Abraham . And this is a list of his ancestors .
40001017	There were 14 generations from Abraham to David . There were also 14 from David to the exile in Babylonia and 14 more to the birth of the Messiah .
40001018	This is how Jesus Christ was born . A young woman named Mary was engaged to Joseph from King David's family . But before they were married , she learned that she was going to have a baby by God's Holy Spirit .
40001019	Joseph was a good man and did not want to embarrass Mary in front of everyone . So he decided to quietly call off the wedding .
40001020	While Joseph was thinking about this , an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream . The angel said , “ Joseph , the baby that Mary will have is from the Holy Spirit . Go ahead and marry her .
40001021	Then after her baby is born , name him Jesus , because he will save his people from their sins . ”
40001022	So the Lord's promise came true , just as the prophet had said ,
40001023	“ A virgin will have a baby boy , and he will be called Immanuel , ” which means “ God is with us . ”
40001024	After Joseph woke up , he and Mary were soon married , just as the Lord's angel had told him to do .
40001025	But they did not sleep together before her baby was born . Then Joseph named him Jesus .
40002001	When Jesus was born in the village of Bethlehem in Judea , Herod was king . During this time some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem
40002002	and said , “ Where is the child born to be king of the Jews ? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him . ”
40002003	When King Herod heard about this , he was worried , and so was everyone else in Jerusalem .
40002004	Herod brought together the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses and asked them , “ Where will the Messiah be born ? ”
40002005	They told him , “ He will be born in Bethlehem , just as the prophet wrote ,
40002006	‘ Bethlehem in the land of Judea , you are very important among the towns of Judea . From your town will come a leader , who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel . ’ ”
40002007	Herod secretly called in the wise men and asked them when they had first seen the star .
40002008	He told them , “ Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child . As soon as you find him , let me know . I also want to go and worship him . ”
40002009	The wise men listened to what the king said and then left . And the star they had seen in the east went on ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was .
40002010	They were thrilled and excited to see the star .
40002011	When the men went into the house and saw the child with Mary , his mother , they knelt down and worshiped him . They took out their gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh and gave them to him .
40002012	Later they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod , and they went back home by another road .
40002013	After the wise men had gone , an angel from the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , “ Get up ! Hurry and take the child and his mother to Egypt ! Stay there until I tell you to return , because Herod is looking for the child and wants to kill him . ”
40002014	That night , Joseph got up and took his wife and the child to Egypt ,
40002015	where they stayed until Herod died . So the Lord's promise came true , just as the prophet had said , “ I called my son out of Egypt . ”
40002016	When Herod found out that the wise men from the east had tricked him , he was very angry . He gave orders for his men to kill all the boys who lived in or near Bethlehem and were two years old and younger . This was based on what he had learned from the wise men .
40002017	So the Lord's promise came true , just as the prophet Jeremiah had said ,
40002018	“ In Ramah a voice was heard crying and weeping loudly . Rachel was mourning for her children , and she refused to be comforted , because they were dead . ”
40002019	After King Herod died , an angel from the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph while he was still in Egypt .
40002020	The angel said , “ Get up and take the child and his mother back to Israel . The people who wanted to kill him are now dead . ”
40002021	Joseph got up and left with them for Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Herod's son Archelaus was now ruler of Judea , he was afraid to go there . Then in a dream he was told to go to Galilee ,
40002023	and they went to live there in the town of Nazareth . So the Lord's promise came true , just as the prophet had said , “ He will be called a Nazarene . ”
40003001	Years later , John the Baptist started preaching in the desert of Judea .
40003002	He said , “ Turn back to God ! The kingdom of heaven will soon be here . ”
40003003	John was the one the prophet Isaiah was talking about , when he said , “ In the desert someone is shouting , ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ! Make a straight path for him . ’ ”
40003004	John wore clothes made of camel's hair . He had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey .
40003005	From Jerusalem and all Judea and from the Jordan River Valley crowds of people went to John .
40003006	They told how sorry they were for their sins , and he baptized them in the river .
40003007	Many Pharisees and Sadducees also came to be baptized . But John said to them :
40003013	Jesus left Galilee and went to the Jordan River to be baptized by John .
40003014	But John kept objecting and said , “ I ought to be baptized by you . Why have you come to me ? ”
40003015	Jesus answered , “ For now this is how it should be , because we must do all God wants us to do . ” Then John agreed .
40003016	So Jesus was baptized . And as soon as he came out of the water , the sky opened , and he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove .
40003017	Then a voice from heaven said , “ This is my own dear Son , and I am pleased with him . ”
40004001	The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert , so that the devil could test him .
40004002	After Jesus had gone without eating for 40 days and nights , he was very hungry .
40004003	Then the devil came to him and said , “ If you are God's Son , tell these stones to turn into bread . ”
40004004	Jesus answered , “ The Scriptures say : ‘ No one can live only on food . People need every word that God has spoken . ’ ”
40004005	Next , the devil took Jesus into the holy city to the highest part of the temple .
40004006	The devil said , “ If you are God's Son , jump off . The Scriptures say : ‘ God will give his angels orders about you . They will catch you in their arms , and you won't hurt your feet on the stones . ’ ”
40004007	Jesus answered , “ The Scriptures also say , ‘ Don't try to test the Lord your God ! ’ ”
40004008	Finally , the devil took Jesus up on a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms on earth and their power .
40004009	The devil said to him , “ I will give all this to you , if you will bow down and worship me . ”
40004010	Jesus answered , “ Go away Satan ! The Scriptures say : ‘ Worship the Lord your God and serve only him . ’ ”
40004011	Then the devil left Jesus , and angels came to help him .
40004012	When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison , he went to Galilee .
40004013	But instead of staying in Nazareth , Jesus moved to Capernaum . This town was beside Lake Galilee in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali .
40004014	So God's promise came true , just as the prophet Isaiah had said ,
40004015	“ Listen , lands of Zebulun and Naphtali , lands along the road to the sea and across the Jordan . Listen Galilee , land of the Gentiles !
40004016	Although your people live in darkness , they will see a bright light . Although they live in the shadow of death , a light will shine on them . ”
40004017	Then Jesus started preaching , “ Turn back to God ! The kingdom of heaven will soon be here . ”
40004018	While Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee , he saw two brothers . One was Simon , also known as Peter , and the other was Andrew . They were fishermen , and they were casting their net into the lake .
40004019	Jesus said to them , “ Follow me ! I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish . ”
40004020	Right then the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him .
40004021	Jesus walked on until he saw James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat with their father , mending their nets . Jesus asked them to come with him .
40004022	At once they left the boat and their father and went with Jesus .
40004023	Jesus went all over Galilee , teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news about God's kingdom . He also healed every kind of disease and sickness .
40004024	News about him spread all over Syria , and people with every kind of sickness or disease were brought to him . Some of them had a lot of demons in them , others were thought to be crazy , and still others could not walk . But Jesus healed them all .
40004025	Large crowds followed Jesus from Galilee and the region around the ten cities known as Decapolis . They also came from Jerusalem , Judea , and from across the Jordan River .
40005001	When Jesus saw the crowds , he went up on the side of a mountain and sat down . Jesus' disciples gathered around him ,
40005002	and he taught them :
40005003	God blesses those people who depend only on him . They belong to the kingdom of heaven !
40005004	God blesses those people who grieve . They will find comfort !
40005005	God blesses those people who are humble . The earth will belong to them !
40005006	God blesses those people who want to obey him more than to eat or drink . They will be given what they want !
40005007	God blesses those people who are merciful . They will be treated with mercy !
40005008	God blesses those people whose hearts are pure . They will see him !
40005009	God blesses those people who make peace . They will be called his children !
40005010	God blesses those people who are treated badly for doing right . They belong to the kingdom of heaven .
40006010	Come and set up your kingdom , so that everyone on earth will obey you , as you are obeyed in heaven .
40006011	Give us our food for today .
40006012	Forgive us for doing wrong , as we forgive others .
40006013	Keep us from being tempted and protect us from evil .
40007028	When Jesus finished speaking , the crowds were surprised at his teaching .
40007029	He taught them like someone with authority , and not like their teachers of the Law of Moses .
40008001	As Jesus came down the mountain , he was followed by large crowds .
40008002	Suddenly a man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus . He said , “ Lord , you have the power to make me well , if only you wanted to . ”
40008003	Jesus put his hand on the man and said , “ I want to ! Now you are well . ” At once the man's leprosy disappeared .
40008004	Jesus told him , “ Don't tell anyone about this , but go and show the priest that you are well . Then take a gift to the temple just as Moses commanded , and everyone will know that you have been healed . ”
40008005	When Jesus was going into the town of Capernaum , an army officer came up to him and said ,
40008006	“ Lord , my servant is at home in such terrible pain that he can't even move . ”
40008007	“ I will go and heal him , ” Jesus replied .
40008008	But the officer said , “ Lord , I'm not good enough for you to come into my house . Just give the order , and my servant will get well .
40008009	I have officers who give orders to me , and I have soldiers who take orders from me . I can say to one of them , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes . I can say to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes . I can say to my servant , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he will do it . ”
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him , “ I tell you in all of Israel I've never found anyone with this much faith !
40008011	Many people will come from everywhere to enjoy the feast in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
40008012	But the ones who should have been in the kingdom will be thrown out into the dark . They will cry and grit their teeth in pain . ”
40008013	Then Jesus said to the officer , “ You may go home now . Your faith has made it happen . ” Right then his servant was healed .
40008014	Jesus went to the home of Peter , where he found that Peter's mother-in-law was sick in bed with fever .
40008015	He took her by the hand , and the fever left her . Then she got up and served Jesus a meal .
40008016	That evening many people with demons in them were brought to Jesus . And with only a word he forced out the evil spirits and healed everyone who was sick .
40008017	So God's promise came true , just as the prophet Isaiah had said , “ He healed our diseases and made us well . ”
40008018	When Jesus saw the crowd , he went across Lake Galilee .
40008019	A teacher of the Law of Moses came up to him and said , “ Teacher , I'll go anywhere with you ! ”
40008020	Jesus replied , “ Foxes have dens , and birds have nests . But the Son of Man doesn't have a place to call his own . ”
40008021	Another disciple said to Jesus , “ Lord , let me wait till I bury my father . ”
40008022	Jesus answered , “ Follow me , and let the dead bury their dead . ”
40008023	After Jesus left in a boat with his disciples ,
40008024	a terrible storm suddenly struck the lake , and waves started splashing into their boat . Jesus was sound asleep ,
40008025	so the disciples went over to him and woke him up . They said , “ Lord , wake up ! Save us before we drown ! ”
40008026	But Jesus replied , “ Why are you so afraid ? You surely don't have much faith . ” Then he got up and ordered the wind and the waves to calm down . And everything was calm .
40008027	The men in the boat were amazed and said , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him . ”
40008028	After Jesus had crossed the lake , he came to shore near the town of Gadara and started down the road . Two men with demons in them came to him from the tombs . They were so fierce that no one could travel that way .
40008029	Suddenly they shouted , “ Jesus , Son of God , what do you want with us ? Have you come to punish us before our time ? ”
40008030	Not far from there a large herd of pigs was feeding .
40008031	So the demons begged Jesus , “ If you force us out , please send us into those pigs ! ”
40008032	Jesus told them to go , and they went out of the men and into the pigs . All at once the pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned .
40008033	The people taking care of the pigs ran to the town and told everything , especially what had happened to the two men .
40008034	Everyone in town came out to meet Jesus . When they saw him , they begged him to leave their part of the country .
40009001	Jesus got into a boat and crossed back over to the town where he lived .
40009002	Some people soon brought to him a man lying on a mat because he could not walk . When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the man , “ My friend , don't worry ! Your sins are forgiven . ”
40009003	Some teachers of the Law of Moses said to themselves , “ Jesus must think he is God ! ”
40009004	But Jesus knew what was in their minds , and he said , “ Why are you thinking such evil things ?
40009005	Is it easier for me to tell this man his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk ?
40009006	But I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth . ” So Jesus said to the man , “ Get up ! Pick up your mat and go on home . ”
40009007	The man got up and went home .
40009008	When the crowds saw this , they were afraid and praised God for giving such authority to people .
40009009	As Jesus was leaving , he saw a tax collector named Matthew sitting at the place for paying taxes . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me . ” Matthew got up and went with him .
40009010	Later , Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Matthew's house . Many tax collectors and other sinners were also there .
40009011	Some Pharisees asked Jesus' disciples , “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners ? ”
40009012	Jesus heard them and answered , “ Healthy people don't need a doctor , but sick people do .
40009013	Go and learn what the Scriptures mean when they say , ‘ Instead of offering sacrifices to me , I want you to be merciful to others . ’ I didn't come to invite good people to be my followers . I came to invite sinners . ”
40009014	Some followers of John the Baptist came and asked Jesus , “ Why do we and the Pharisees often go without eating , while your disciples never do ? ”
40009015	Jesus answered :
40009018	While Jesus was still speaking , an official came and knelt in front of him . The man said , “ My daughter has just now died ! Please come and place your hand on her . Then she will live again . ”
40009019	Jesus and his disciples got up and went with the man .
40009020	A woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and barely touched his clothes .
40009021	She had said to herself , “ If I can just touch his clothes , I will be healed . ”
40009022	Jesus turned . He saw the woman and said , “ Don't worry ! You are now healed because of your faith . ” At that moment she was healed .
40009023	When Jesus went into the home of the official and saw the musicians and the crowd of mourners ,
40009024	he said , “ Get out of here ! The little girl isn't dead . She is just asleep . ” Everyone started laughing at Jesus .
40009025	But after the crowd had been sent out of the house , Jesus went to the girl's bedside . He took her by the hand and helped her up .
40009026	News about this spread all over that part of the country .
40009027	As Jesus was leaving that place , two blind men began following him and shouting , “ Son of David , have pity on us ! ”
40009028	After Jesus had gone indoors , the two blind men came up to him . He asked them , “ Do you believe I can make you well ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” they answered .
40009029	Jesus touched their eyes and said , “ Because of your faith , you will be healed . ”
40009030	They were able to see , and Jesus strictly warned them not to tell anyone about him .
40009031	But they left and talked about him to everyone in that part of the country .
40009032	As Jesus and his disciples were on their way , some people brought to him a man who could not talk because a demon was in him .
40009033	After Jesus had forced the demon out , the man started talking . The crowds were so amazed they began saying , “ Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel ! ”
40009034	But the Pharisees said , “ The leader of the demons gives him the power to force out demons . ”
40009035	Jesus went to every town and village . He taught in their synagogues and preached the good news about God's kingdom . Jesus also healed every kind of disease and sickness .
40009036	When he saw the crowds , he felt sorry for them . They were confused and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	He said to his disciples , “ A large crop is in the fields , but there are only a few workers .
40009038	Ask the Lord in charge of the harvest to send out workers to bring it in . ”
40010001	Jesus called together his twelve disciples . He gave them the power to force out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and sickness .
40010002	The first of the twelve apostles was Simon , better known as Peter . His brother Andrew was an apostle , and so were James and John , the two sons of Zebedee .
40010003	Philip , Bartholomew , Thomas , Matthew the tax collector , James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus were also apostles .
40010004	The others were Simon , known as the Eager One , and Judas Iscariot , who later betrayed Jesus .
40010005	Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions :
40011001	After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples , he left and began teaching and preaching in the towns .
40011002	John was in prison when he heard what Christ was doing . So John sent some of his followers
40011003	to ask Jesus , “ Are you the one we should be looking for ? Or must we wait for someone else ? ”
40011004	Jesus answered , “ Go and tell John what you have heard and seen .
40011005	The blind are now able to see , and the lame can walk . People with leprosy are being healed , and the deaf can hear . The dead are raised to life , and the poor are hearing the good news .
40011006	God will bless everyone who doesn't reject me because of what I do . ”
40011007	As John's followers were going away , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John :
40011017	“ We played the flute , but you would not dance ! We sang a funeral song , but you would not mourn ! ”
40011020	In the towns where Jesus had worked most of his miracles , the people refused to turn to God . So Jesus was upset with them and said :
40011025	At that moment Jesus said :
40012001	One Sabbath , Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields . His disciples were hungry and began picking and eating grains of wheat .
40012002	Some Pharisees noticed this and said to Jesus , “ Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath ? They are not supposed to do this ! ”
40012003	Jesus answered :
40012009	Jesus left and went into one of their synagogues ,
40012010	where there was a man whose hand was paralyzed . Some Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong , so they asked him , “ Is it right to heal someone on the Sabbath ? ”
40012011	Jesus answered , “ If one of your sheep fell into a ditch on the Sabbath , wouldn't you lift it out ?
40012012	People are worth much more than sheep , and so it is right to do good on the Sabbath . ”
40012013	Then Jesus told the man , “ Hold out your hand . ” The man did , and it became as healthy as the other one .
40012014	The Pharisees left and started making plans to kill Jesus .
40012015	When Jesus found out what was happening , he left there and large crowds followed him . He healed all of their sick ,
40012016	but warned them not to tell anyone about him .
40012017	So God's promise came true , just as Isaiah the prophet had said ,
40012018	“ Here is my chosen servant ! I love him , and he pleases me . I will give him my Spirit , and he will bring justice to the nations .
40012019	He won't shout or yell or call out in the streets .
40012020	He won't break off a bent reed or put out a dying flame , but he will make sure that justice is done .
40012021	All nations will place their hope in him . ”
40012022	Some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk because he had a demon in him . Jesus healed the man , and then he was able to talk and see .
40012023	The crowds were so amazed they asked , “ Could Jesus be the Son of David ? ”
40012024	When the Pharisees heard this , they said , “ He forces out demons by the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons ! ”
40012025	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he said to them :
40012038	Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses said , “ Teacher , we want you to show us a sign from heaven . ”
40012039	But Jesus replied :
40012046	While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds , his mother and brothers came and stood outside because they wanted to talk with him .
40012047	Someone told Jesus , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to talk with you . ”
40012048	Jesus answered , “ Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? ”
40012049	Then he pointed to his disciples and said , “ These are my mother and my brothers !
40012050	Anyone who obeys my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother . ”
40013001	That same day Jesus left the house and went out beside Lake Galilee , where he sat down to teach .
40013002	Such large crowds gathered around him that he had to sit in a boat , while the people stood on the shore .
40013003	Then he taught them many things by using stories . He said :
40013010	Jesus' disciples came to him and asked , “ Why do you use stories to speak to the people ? ”
40013011	Jesus answered : “ These people will listen and listen , but never understand . They will look and look , but never see .
40013015	All of them have stubborn minds ! They refuse to listen ; they cover their eyes . They cannot see or hear or understand . If they could , they would turn to me , and I would heal them . ”
40013018	Now listen to the meaning of the story about the farmer :
40013024	Jesus then told them this story :
40013031	Jesus told them another story :
40013033	Jesus also said :
40013034	Jesus used stories when he spoke to the people . In fact , he did not tell them anything without using stories .
40013035	So God's promise came true , just as the prophet had said , “ I will use stories to speak my message and to explain things hidden since the creation of the world . ”
40013036	After Jesus left the crowd and went inside , his disciples came to him and said , “ Explain to us the story about the weeds in the wheat field . ”
40013037	Jesus answered :
40013051	Jesus asked his disciples if they understood all these things . They said , “ Yes , we do . ”
40013052	So he told them , “ Every student of the Scriptures who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like someone who brings out new and old treasures from the storeroom . ”
40013053	When Jesus had finished telling these stories , he left
40013054	and went to his hometown . He taught in their synagogue , and the people were so amazed that they asked , “ Where does he get all this wisdom and the power to work these miracles ?
40013055	Isn't he the son of the carpenter ? Isn't Mary his mother , and aren't James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas his brothers ?
40013056	Don't his sisters still live here in our town ? How can he do all this ? ”
40013057	So the people were upset because of what he was doing . But Jesus said , “ Prophets are honored by everyone , except the people of their hometown and their own family . ”
40013058	And because the people did not have any faith , Jesus did not work many miracles there .
40014001	About this time Herod the ruler heard the news about Jesus
40014002	and told his officials , “ This is John the Baptist ! He has come back from death , and that's why he has the power to work these miracles . ”
40014005	Herod wanted to kill John . But the people thought John was a prophet , and Herod was afraid of what they might do .
40014006	When Herod's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests . She pleased Herod
40014007	so much he swore to give her whatever she wanted .
40014008	But the girl's mother told her to say , “ Here on a serving plate I want the head of John the Baptist ! ”
40014009	Herod was sorry for what he had said . But he did not want to break the promise he had made in front of his guests . So he ordered a guard
40014010	to go to the prison and cut off John's head .
40014011	It was taken on a serving plate to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
40014012	John's followers took his body and buried it . Then they told Jesus what had happened .
40014013	After Jesus heard about John , he crossed Lake Galilee to go to some place where he could be alone . But the crowds found out and followed him on foot from the towns .
40014014	When Jesus got out of the boat , he saw the large crowd . He felt sorry for them and healed everyone who was sick .
40014015	That evening the disciples came to Jesus and said , “ This place is like a desert , and it's already late . Let the crowds leave , so they can go to the villages and buy some food . ”
40014016	Jesus replied , “ They don't have to leave . Why don't you give them something to eat ? ”
40014017	But they said , “ We have only five small loaves of bread and two fish . ”
40014018	Jesus asked his disciples to bring the food to him ,
40014019	and he told the crowd to sit down on the grass . Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up toward heaven and blessed the food . Then he broke the bread and handed it to his disciples , and they gave it to the people .
40014020	After everyone had eaten all they wanted , Jesus' disciples picked up twelve large baskets of leftovers .
40014021	There were about 5,000 men who ate , not counting the women and children .
40014022	At once , Jesus made his disciples get into a boat and start back across the lake . But he stayed until he had sent the crowds away .
40014023	Then he went up on a mountain where he could be alone and pray . Later in the evening , he was still there .
40014024	By this time the boat was a long way from the shore . It was going against the wind and was being tossed around by the waves .
40014025	A little while before morning , Jesus came walking on the water toward his disciples .
40014026	When they saw him , they thought he was a ghost . They were terrified and started screaming .
40014027	At once , Jesus said to them , “ Don't worry ! I am Jesus . Don't be afraid . ”
40014028	Peter replied , “ Lord , if it really is you , tell me to come to you on the water . ”
40014029	“ Come on ! ” Jesus said . Peter then got out of the boat and started walking on the water toward him .
40014030	But when Peter saw how strong the wind was , he was afraid and started sinking . “ Save me , Lord ! ” he shouted .
40014031	At once , Jesus reached out his hand . He helped Peter up and said , “ You surely don't have much faith . Why do you doubt ? ”
40014032	When Jesus and Peter got into the boat , the wind died down .
40014033	The men in the boat worshiped Jesus and said , “ You really are the Son of God ! ”
40014034	Jesus and his disciples crossed the lake and came to shore near the town of Gennesaret .
40014035	The people found out he was there , and they sent word to everyone who lived in this part of the country . So they brought all the sick people to Jesus .
40014036	They begged him just to let them touch his clothes , and everyone who did was healed .
40015001	About this time some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem . They asked Jesus ,
40015002	“ Why don't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do ? They don't even wash their hands before they eat . ”
40015003	Jesus answered :
40015008	“ All of you praise me with your words , but you never really think about me .
40015009	It is useless for you to worship me , when you teach rules made up by humans . ”
40015010	Jesus called the crowd together and said , “ Pay attention and try to understand what I mean .
40015011	The food you put into your mouth doesn't make you unclean and unfit to worship God . The bad words that come out of your mouth are what make you unclean . ”
40015012	Then his disciples came over to him and asked , “ Do you know you insulted the Pharisees by what you said ? ”
40015013	Jesus answered , “ Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled up by the roots .
40015014	Stay away from those Pharisees ! They are like blind people leading other blind people , and all of them will fall into a ditch . ”
40015015	Peter replied , “ What did you mean when you talked about the things that make people unclean ? ”
40015016	Jesus then said :
40015021	Jesus left and went to the territory near the towns of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	Suddenly a Canaanite woman from there came out shouting , “ Lord and Son of David , have pity on me ! My daughter is full of demons . ”
40015023	Jesus did not say a word . But the woman kept following along and shouting , so his disciples came up and asked him to send her away .
40015024	Jesus said , “ I was sent only to the people of Israel ! They are like a flock of lost sheep . ”
40015025	The woman came closer . Then she knelt down and begged , “ Please help me , Lord ! ”
40015026	Jesus replied , “ It isn't right to take food away from children and feed it to dogs . ”
40015027	“ Lord , this is true , ” the woman said , “ but even puppies get the crumbs that fall from their owner's table . ”
40015028	Jesus answered , “ Dear woman , you really do have a lot of faith , and you will be given what you want . ” At that moment her daughter was healed .
40015029	From there , Jesus went along Lake Galilee . Then he climbed a hill and sat down .
40015030	Large crowds came and brought many people who were paralyzed or blind or lame or unable to talk . They placed them , and many others , in front of Jesus , and he healed them all .
40015031	Everyone was amazed at what they saw and heard . People who had never spoken could now speak . The lame were healed , the paralyzed could walk , and the blind were able to see . Everyone was praising the God of Israel .
40015032	Jesus called his disciples together and told them , “ I feel sorry for these people . They have been with me for three days , and they don't have anything to eat . I don't want to send them away hungry . They might faint on their way home . ”
40015033	His disciples said , “ This place is like a desert . Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd ? ”
40015034	Jesus asked them how much food they had . They replied , “ Seven small loaves of bread and a few little fish . ”
40015035	After Jesus had told the people to sit down ,
40015036	he took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks . He then broke them and handed them to his disciples , who passed them around to the crowds .
40015037	Everyone ate all they wanted , and the leftovers filled seven large baskets .
40015038	There were 4,000 men who ate , not counting the women and children .
40015039	After Jesus had sent the crowds away , he got into a boat and sailed across the lake . He came to shore near the town of Magadan .
40016001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tried to test him by asking for a sign from heaven .
40016002	He told them : Then Jesus left .
40016005	The disciples had forgotten to bring any bread when they crossed the lake .
40016006	Jesus then warned them , “ Watch out ! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . ”
40016007	The disciples talked this over and said to each other , “ He must be saying this because we didn't bring along any bread . ”
40016008	Jesus knew what they were thinking and said :
40016012	Finally , the disciples understood that Jesus wasn't talking about the yeast used to make bread , but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	When Jesus and his disciples were near the town of Caesarea Philippi , he asked them , “ What do people say about the Son of Man ? ”
40016014	The disciples answered , “ Some people say you are John the Baptist or maybe Elijah or Jeremiah or some other prophet . ”
40016015	Then Jesus asked , “ But who do you say I am ? ”
40016016	Simon Peter spoke up , “ You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God . ”
40016017	Jesus told him :
40016020	Jesus told his disciples not to tell anyone he was the Messiah .
40016021	From then on , Jesus began telling his disciples what would happen to him . He said , “ I must go to Jerusalem . There the nation's leaders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make me suffer terribly . I will be killed , but three days later I will rise to life . ”
40016022	Peter took Jesus aside and told him to stop talking like that . He said , “ God would never let this happen to you , Lord ! ”
40016023	Jesus turned to Peter and said , “ Satan , get away from me ! You're in my way because you think like everyone else and not like God . ”
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples :
40017001	Six days later Jesus took Peter and the brothers James and John with him . They went up on a very high mountain where they could be alone .
40017002	There in front of the disciples , Jesus was completely changed . His face was shining like the sun , and his clothes became white as light .
40017003	All at once Moses and Elijah were there talking with Jesus .
40017004	So Peter said to him , “ Lord , it is good for us to be here ! Let us make three shelters , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
40017005	While Peter was still speaking , the shadow of a bright cloud passed over them . From the cloud a voice said , “ This is my own dear Son , and I am pleased with him . Listen to what he says ! ”
40017006	When the disciples heard the voice , they were so afraid they fell flat on the ground .
40017007	But Jesus came over and touched them . He said , “ Get up and don't be afraid ! ”
40017008	When they opened their eyes , they saw only Jesus .
40017009	On their way down from the mountain , Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had been raised from death .
40017010	The disciples asked Jesus , “ Don't the teachers of the Law of Moses say Elijah must come before the Messiah does ? ”
40017011	Jesus told them , “ Elijah certainly will come and get everything ready .
40017012	In fact , he has already come . But the people did not recognize him and treated him just as they wanted to . They will soon make the Son of Man suffer in the same way . ”
40017013	Then the disciples understood Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist .
40017014	Jesus and his disciples returned to the crowd . A man knelt in front of him
40017015	and said , “ Lord , have pity on my son ! He has a bad case of epilepsy and often falls into a fire or into water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples , but none of them could heal him . ”
40017017	Jesus said , “ You people are too stubborn to have any faith ! How much longer must I be with you ? Why do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy here . ”
40017018	Then Jesus spoke sternly to the demon . It went out of the boy , and right then he was healed .
40017019	Later the disciples went to Jesus in private and asked him , “ Why couldn't we force out the demon ? ”
40017022	While Jesus and his disciples were going from place to place in Galilee , he told them , “ The Son of Man will be handed over to people
40017023	who will kill him . But three days later he will rise to life . ” All of this made the disciples very sad .
40017024	When Jesus and the others arrived in Capernaum , the collectors for the temple tax came to Peter and asked , “ Does your teacher pay the temple tax ? ”
40017025	“ Yes , he does , ” Peter answered . After they had returned home , Jesus went up to Peter and asked him , “ Simon , what do you think ? Do the kings of this earth collect taxes and fees from their own people or from foreigners ? ”
40017026	Peter answered , “ From foreigners . ” Jesus replied , “ Then their own people don't have to pay .
40017027	But we don't want to cause trouble . So go cast a line into the lake and pull out the first fish you hook . Open its mouth , and you will find a coin . Use it to pay your taxes and mine . ”
40018001	About this time the disciples came to Jesus and asked him who would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018002	Jesus called for a child to come over and stand near him .
40018003	Then he said :
40018021	Peter came up to the Lord and asked , “ How many times should I forgive someone who does something wrong to me ? Is seven times enough ? ”
40018022	Jesus answered :
40019001	When Jesus finished teaching , he left Galilee and went to the part of Judea east of the Jordan River .
40019002	Large crowds followed him , and he healed their sick .
40019003	Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus . They came up to him and asked , “ Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason ? ”
40019004	Jesus answered , “ Don't you know in the beginning the Creator made a man and a woman ?
40019005	That's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married . He becomes like one person with his wife .
40019006	Then they are no longer two people , but one . And no one should separate a couple God has joined together . ”
40019007	The Pharisees asked Jesus , “ Why did Moses say a man could write out divorce papers and send his wife away ? ”
40019008	Jesus replied , “ You are so heartless ! That's why Moses allowed you to divorce your wife . But from the beginning God did not intend it to be that way .
40019009	I say if your wife has not committed some terrible sexual sin , you must not divorce her to marry someone else . If you do , you are unfaithful . ”
40019010	The disciples said , “ If that's how it is between a man and a woman , it's better not to get married . ”
40019011	Jesus told them , “ Only those people who have been given the gift of staying single can accept this teaching .
40019012	Some people are unable to marry because of birth defects or because of what someone has done to their bodies . Others stay single in order to serve God better . Anyone who can accept this teaching should do so . ”
40019013	Some people brought their children to Jesus , so he could place his hands on them and pray for them . His disciples told the people to stop bothering him .
40019014	But Jesus said , “ Let the children come to me , and don't try to stop them ! People who are like these children belong to God's kingdom . ”
40019015	After Jesus had placed his hands on the children , he left .
40019016	A man came to Jesus and asked , “ Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? ”
40019017	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? Only God is good . If you want to have eternal life , you must obey his commandments . ”
40019018	“ Which ones ? ” the man asked . Jesus answered , “ Do not murder . Be faithful in marriage . Do not steal . Do not tell lies about others .
40019019	Respect your father and mother . And love others as much as you love yourself . ”
40019020	The young man said , “ I have obeyed all of these . What else must I do ? ”
40019021	Jesus replied , “ If you want to be perfect , go sell everything you own ! Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come and be my follower . ”
40019022	When the young man heard this , he went away sad , because he was very rich .
40019023	Jesus said to his disciples , “ I tell you , it's terribly hard for rich people to get into the kingdom of heaven !
40019024	In fact , it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom . ”
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were greatly surprised and asked , “ How can anyone ever be saved ? ”
40019026	Jesus looked straight at them and said , “ There are some things people cannot do , but God can do anything . ”
40019027	Peter replied , “ Remember , we have left everything to be your followers ! What will we get ? ”
40019028	Jesus answered :
40020001	As Jesus was telling what the kingdom of heaven would be like , he said :
40020016	Jesus then said , “ So it is . Everyone who is now last will be first , and everyone who is first will be last . ”
40020017	As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem , he took his twelve disciples aside and told them in private :
40020020	The mother of James and John came to Jesus with her two sons . She knelt down and started begging him to do something for her .
40020021	Jesus asked her what she wanted , and she said , “ When you come into your kingdom , please let one of my sons sit at your right side and the other at your left . ”
40020022	Jesus answered , “ Not one of you knows what you are asking . Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from ? ” James and John said , “ Yes , we are ! ”
40020023	Jesus replied , “ You certainly will drink from my cup ! But it isn't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left . This is for my Father to say . ”
40020024	When the ten other disciples heard this , they were angry with the two brothers .
40020025	But Jesus called the disciples together and said :
40020029	Jesus was followed by a large crowd as he and his disciples were leaving Jericho .
40020030	Two blind men were sitting beside the road . And when they heard that Jesus was coming their way , they shouted , “ Lord and Son of David , have pity on us ! ”
40020031	The crowd told them to be quiet , but they shouted even louder , “ Lord and Son of David , have pity on us ! ”
40020032	When Jesus heard them , he stopped and asked , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
40020033	They answered , “ Lord , we want to see ! ”
40020034	Jesus felt sorry for them and touched their eyes . At once they could see , and they became his followers .
40021001	When Jesus and his disciples came near Jerusalem , he went to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives and sent two of them on ahead .
40021002	He told them , “ Go into the next village , where you will at once find a donkey and her colt . Untie the two donkeys and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone asks why you are doing this , just say , ‘ The Lord needs them . ’ He will at once let you have the donkeys . ”
40021004	So God's promise came true , just as the prophet had said ,
40021005	“ Announce to the people of Jerusalem : ‘ Your king is coming to you ! He is humble and rides on a donkey . He comes on the colt of a donkey . ’ ”
40021006	The disciples left and did what Jesus had told them to do .
40021007	They brought the donkey and its colt and laid some clothes on their backs . Then Jesus got on .
40021008	Many people spread clothes in the road , while others put down branches which they had cut from trees .
40021009	Some people walked ahead of Jesus and others followed behind . They were all shouting , “ Hooray for the Son of David ! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord . Hooray for God in heaven above ! ”
40021010	When Jesus came to Jerusalem , everyone in the city was excited and asked , “ Who can this be ? ”
40021011	The crowds answered , “ This is Jesus , the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee . ”
40021012	Jesus went into the temple and chased out everyone who was selling or buying . He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of the ones who were selling doves .
40021013	He told them , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ My house should be called a place of worship . ’ But you have turned it into a place where robbers hide . ”
40021014	Blind and lame people came to Jesus in the temple , and he healed them .
40021015	But the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were angry when they saw his miracles and heard the children shouting praises to the Son of David .
40021016	The men said to Jesus , “ Don't you hear what those children are saying ? ” “ Yes , I do ! ” Jesus answered . “ Don't you know that the Scriptures say , ‘ Children and infants will sing praises ’ ? ”
40021017	Then Jesus left the city and went out to the village of Bethany , where he spent the night .
40021018	When Jesus got up the next morning , he was hungry . He started out for the city ,
40021019	and along the way he saw a fig tree . But when he came to it , he found only leaves and no figs . So he told the tree , “ You will never again grow any fruit ! ” Right then the fig tree dried up .
40021020	The disciples were shocked when they saw how quickly the tree had dried up .
40021021	But Jesus said to them , “ If you have faith and don't doubt , I promise you can do what I did to this tree . And you will be able to do even more . You can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea , and it will .
40021022	If you have faith when you pray , you will be given whatever you ask for . ”
40021023	Jesus had gone into the temple and was teaching when the chief priests and the leaders of the people came up to him . They asked , “ What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
40021024	Jesus answered , “ I have just one question to ask you . If you answer it , I will tell you where I got the right to do these things .
40021025	Who gave John the right to baptize ? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being ? ” They thought it over and said to each other , “ We can't say God gave John this right . Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John .
40021026	On the other hand , these people think John was a prophet , and we are afraid of what they might do to us . That's why we can't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize . ”
40021027	So they told Jesus , “ We don't know . ” Jesus said , “ Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do . ”
40021028	Jesus said : “ The older one , ” the chief priests and leaders answered . Then Jesus told them :
40021033	Jesus told the chief priests and leaders to listen to this story :
40021040	Jesus asked , “ When the owner of that vineyard comes , what do you suppose he will do to those renters ? ”
40021041	The chief priests and leaders answered , “ He will kill them in some horrible way . Then he will rent out his vineyard to people who will give him his share of grapes at harvest time . ”
40021042	Jesus replied , “ You surely know that the Scriptures say , ‘ The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all . This is something the Lord has done , and it is amazing to us . ’
40021045	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these stories , they knew Jesus was talking about them .
40021046	So they looked for a way to arrest Jesus . But they were afraid to , because the people thought he was a prophet .
40022001	Once again Jesus used stories to teach the people :
40022015	The Pharisees got together and planned how they could trick Jesus into saying something wrong .
40022016	They sent some of their followers and some of Herod's followers to say to him , “ Teacher , we know that you are honest . You teach the truth about what God wants people to do . And you treat everyone with the same respect , no matter who they are .
40022017	Tell us what you think ! Should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not ? ”
40022018	Jesus knew their evil thoughts and said , “ Why are you trying to test me ? You show-offs !
40022019	Let me see one of the coins used for paying taxes . ” They brought him a silver coin ,
40022020	and he asked , “ Whose picture and name are on it ? ”
40022021	“ The Emperor's , ” they answered . Then Jesus told them , “ Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God . ”
40022022	His answer surprised them so much that they walked away .
40022023	The Sadducees did not believe people would rise to life after death . So that same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus and said :
40022029	Jesus answered :
40022033	The crowds were surprised to hear what Jesus was teaching .
40022034	After Jesus had made the Sadducees look foolish , the Pharisees heard about it and got together .
40022035	One of them was an expert in the Jewish Law . So he tried to test Jesus by asking ,
40022036	“ Teacher , what is the most important commandment in the Law ? ”
40022037	Jesus answered :
40022041	While the Pharisees were still there , Jesus asked them ,
40022042	“ What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose family will he come from ? ” They answered , “ He will be a son of King David . ”
40022043	Jesus replied , “ How then could the Spirit lead David to call the Messiah his Lord ? David said ,
40022044	‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you . ’
40023001	Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples : “ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord . ”
40024001	After Jesus left the temple , his disciples came over and said , “ Look at all these buildings ! ”
40024002	Jesus replied , “ Do you see these buildings ? They will certainly be torn down ! Not one stone will be left in place . ”
40024003	Later , as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , his disciples came to him in private and asked , “ When will this happen ? What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world ? ”
40024004	Jesus answered : “ The sun will become dark , and the moon will no longer shine . The stars will fall , and the powers in the sky will be shaken . ”
40025046	Then Jesus said , “ Those people will be punished forever . But the ones who pleased God will have eternal life . ”
40026001	When Jesus had finished teaching , he told his disciples ,
40026002	“ You know two days from now will be Passover . This is when the Son of Man will be handed over to his enemies and nailed to a cross . ”
40026003	At that time the chief priests and the nation's leaders were meeting at the home of Caiaphas the high priest .
40026004	They planned how they could sneak around and have Jesus arrested and put to death .
40026005	But they said , “ We must not do it during Passover , because the people will riot . ”
40026006	Jesus was in the town of Bethany , eating at the home of Simon , who had leprosy .
40026007	A woman came in with a bottle of expensive perfume and poured it on Jesus' head .
40026008	But when his disciples saw this , they became angry and complained , “ Why such a waste ?
40026009	We could have sold this perfume for a lot of money and given it to the poor . ”
40026010	Jesus knew what they were thinking , and he said :
40026014	Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve disciples . He went to the chief priests
40026015	and asked , “ How much will you give me if I help you arrest Jesus ? ” They paid Judas 30 silver coins ,
40026016	and from then on he started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus .
40026017	On the first day of the Festival of Thin Bread , Jesus' disciples came to him and asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal ? ”
40026018	Jesus told them to go to a certain man in the city and tell him , “ Our teacher says , ‘ My time has come ! I want to eat the Passover meal with my disciples in your home . ’ ”
40026019	They did as Jesus told them and prepared the meal .
40026022	The disciples were very sad , and each one said to Jesus , “ Lord , you can't mean me ! ”
40026023	He answered , “ One of you men who has eaten with me from this dish will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man will die , as the Scriptures say . But it's going to be terrible for the one who betrays me ! That man would be better off if he had never been born . ”
40026025	Judas said , “ Teacher , you surely don't mean me ! ” “ That's what you say ! ” Jesus replied . But later , Judas did betray him .
40026026	During the meal Jesus took some bread in his hands . He blessed the bread and broke it . Then he gave it to his disciples and said , “ Take this and eat it . This is my body . ”
40026027	Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God . He then gave it to his disciples and said , “ Take this and drink it .
40026028	This is my blood , and with it God makes his agreement with you . It will be poured out , so that many people will have their sins forgiven .
40026029	From now on I am not going to drink any wine , until I drink new wine with you in my Father's kingdom . ”
40026030	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Jesus said to his disciples , “ During this very night , all of you will reject me , as the Scriptures say , ‘ I will strike down the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ’
40026033	Peter spoke up , “ Even if all the others reject you , I never will ! ”
40026034	Jesus replied , “ I promise you before a rooster crows tonight , you will say three times that you don't know me . ”
40026035	But Peter said , “ Even if I have to die with you , I will never say I don't know you . ” All the others said the same thing .
40026036	Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane . When they got there , he told them , “ Sit here while I go over there and pray . ”
40026037	Jesus took along Peter and the two brothers , James and John . He was very sad and troubled ,
40026038	and he said to them , “ I am so sad that I feel as if I am dying . Stay here and keep awake with me . ”
40026039	Jesus walked on a little way . Then he knelt with his face to the ground and prayed , “ My Father , if it is possible , don't make me suffer by drinking from this cup . But do what you want , and not what I want . ”
40026040	He came back and found his disciples sleeping . So he said to Peter , “ Can't any of you stay awake with me for just one hour ?
40026041	Stay awake and pray that you won't be tested . You want to do what is right , but you are weak . ”
40026042	Again Jesus went to pray and said , “ My Father , if there is no other way , and I must suffer , I will still do what you want . ”
40026043	Jesus came back and found them sleeping again . They simply could not keep their eyes open .
40026044	He left them and prayed the same prayer once more .
40026045	Finally , Jesus returned to his disciples and said , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners .
40026046	Get up ! Let's go . The one who will betray me is already here . ”
40026047	Jesus was still speaking , when Judas the betrayer came up . He was one of the twelve disciples , and a large mob armed with swords and clubs was with him . They had been sent by the chief priests and the nation's leaders .
40026048	Judas had told them ahead of time , “ Arrest the man I greet with a kiss . ”
40026049	Judas walked right up to Jesus and said , “ Hello , teacher . ” Then Judas kissed him .
40026050	Jesus replied , “ My friend , do what you came for . ” The men grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
40026051	One of Jesus' followers pulled out a sword . He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
40026052	But Jesus told him , “ Put your sword away . Anyone who lives by fighting will die by fighting .
40026053	Don't you know that I could ask my Father , and he would at once send me more than twelve armies of angels ?
40026054	But then , how could the words of the Scriptures come true , which say this must happen ? ”
40026055	Jesus said to the mob , “ Why do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like a criminal ? Day after day I sat and taught in the temple , and you didn't arrest me .
40026056	But all this happened , so that what the prophets wrote would come true . ” All Jesus' disciples left him and ran away .
40026057	After Jesus had been arrested , he was led off to the house of Caiaphas the high priest . The nation's leaders and the teachers of the Law of Moses were meeting there .
40026058	But Peter followed along at a distance and came to the courtyard of the high priest's palace . He went in and sat down with the guards to see what was going to happen .
40026059	The chief priests and the whole council wanted to put Jesus to death . So they tried to find some people who would tell lies about him in court .
40026060	But they could not find any , even though many did come and tell lies . At last , two men came forward
40026061	and said , “ This man claimed he could tear down God's temple and build it again in three days . ”
40026062	The high priest stood up and asked Jesus , “ Why don't you say something in your own defense ? Don't you hear the charges they are making against you ? ”
40026063	But Jesus did not answer . So the high priest said , “ With the living God looking on , you must tell the truth . Are you the Messiah , the Son of God ? ”
40026064	“ That is what you say ! ” Jesus answered . “ But I tell all of you , ‘ Soon you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All-Powerful and coming on the clouds of heaven . ’ ”
40026065	The high priest then tore his robe and said , “ This man claims to be God ! We don't need any more witnesses ! You have heard what he said .
40026066	What do you think ? ” They answered , “ He is guilty and deserves to die ! ”
40026067	Then they spit in his face and hit him with their fists . Others slapped him
40026068	and said , “ You think you are the Messiah ! So tell us who hit you ! ”
40026069	While Peter was sitting out in the courtyard , a servant girl came up to him and said , “ You were with Jesus from Galilee . ”
40026070	But in front of everyone Peter said , “ That isn't so ! I don't know what you are talking about ! ”
40026071	When Peter had gone out to the gate , another servant girl saw him and said to some people there , “ This man was with Jesus from Nazareth . ”
40026072	Again Peter denied it , and this time he swore , “ I don't even know that man ! ”
40026073	A little while later some people standing there walked over to Peter and said , “ We know you are one of them . We can tell it because you talk like someone from Galilee . ”
40026074	Peter began to curse and swear , “ I don't know that man ! ” Right then a rooster crowed ,
40026075	and Peter remembered that Jesus had said , “ Before a rooster crows , you will say three times you don't know me . ” Then Peter went out and cried bitterly .
40027001	Early the next morning all the chief priests and the nation's leaders met and decided that Jesus should be put to death .
40027002	They tied him up and led him away to Pilate the governor .
40027003	Judas had betrayed Jesus , but when he learned that Jesus had been sentenced to death , he was sorry for what he had done . He returned the 30 silver coins to the chief priests and leaders
40027004	and said , “ I have sinned by betraying a man who has never done anything wrong . ” “ So what ? That's your problem , ” they replied .
40027005	Judas threw the money into the temple and then went out and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests picked up the money and said , “ This money was paid to have a man killed . We can't put it in the temple treasury . ”
40027007	Then they had a meeting and decided to buy a field that belonged to someone who made clay pots . They wanted to use it as a graveyard for foreigners .
40027008	This is why people still call that place “ Field of Blood . ”
40027009	So the words of the prophet Jeremiah came true , “ They took the thirty silver coins , the price of a person among the people of Israel .
40027010	They paid it for a potter's field , as the Lord had commanded me . ”
40027011	Jesus was brought before Pilate the governor , who asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” “ Those are your words ! ” Jesus answered .
40027012	And when the chief priests and leaders brought their charges against him , he did not say a thing .
40027013	Pilate asked him , “ Don't you hear what crimes they say you have done ? ”
40027014	But Jesus did not say anything , and the governor was greatly amazed .
40027015	During Passover the governor always freed a prisoner chosen by the people .
40027016	At that time a well-known terrorist named Jesus Barabbas was in jail .
40027017	So when the crowd came together , Pilate asked them , “ Which prisoner do you want me to set free ? Do you want Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah ? ”
40027018	Pilate knew the leaders had brought Jesus to him because they were jealous .
40027019	While Pilate was judging the case , his wife sent him a message . It said , “ Don't have anything to do with that innocent man . I have had nightmares because of him . ”
40027020	But the chief priests and the leaders convinced the crowds to ask for Barabbas to be set free and for Jesus to be killed .
40027021	Pilate asked the crowd again , “ Which of these two men do you want me to set free ? ” “ Barabbas ! ” they shouted .
40027022	Pilate asked them , “ What am I to do with Jesus , who is called the Messiah ? ” They all yelled , “ Nail him to a cross ! ”
40027023	Pilate answered , “ But what crime has he done ? ” “ Nail him to a cross ! ” they yelled even louder .
40027024	Pilate saw that there was nothing he could do and that the people were starting to riot . So he took some water and washed his hands in front of them and said , “ I won't have anything to do with killing this man . You are the ones doing it ! ”
40027025	Everyone answered , “ We and our own families will take the blame for his death ! ”
40027026	Pilate set Barabbas free . Then he ordered his soldiers to beat Jesus with a whip and nail him to a cross .
40027027	The governor's soldiers led Jesus into the fortress and brought together the rest of the troops .
40027028	They stripped off Jesus' clothes and put a scarlet robe on him .
40027029	They made a crown out of thorn branches and placed it on his head , and they put a stick in his right hand . The soldiers knelt down and pretended to worship him . They made fun of him and shouted , “ Hey , you king of the Jews ! ”
40027030	Then they spit on him . They took the stick from him and beat him on the head with it .
40027031	When the soldiers had finished making fun of Jesus , they took off the robe . They put his own clothes back on him and led him off to be nailed to a cross .
40027032	On the way they met a man named Simon who was from Cyrene , and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross .
40027033	They came to a place named Golgotha , which means “ Place of a Skull . ”
40027034	There they gave Jesus some wine mixed with a drug to ease the pain . But when Jesus tasted what it was , he refused to drink it .
40027035	The soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross and gambled to see who would get his clothes .
40027036	Then they sat down to guard him .
40027037	Above his head they put a sign that told why he was nailed there . It read , “ This is Jesus , the King of the Jews . ”
40027038	The soldiers also nailed two criminals on crosses , one to the right of Jesus and the other to his left .
40027039	People who passed by said terrible things about Jesus . They shook their heads and
40027040	shouted , “ So you're the one who claimed you could tear down the temple and build it again in three days ! If you are God's Son , save yourself and come down from the cross ! ”
40027041	The chief priests , the leaders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses also made fun of Jesus . They said ,
40027042	“ He saved others , but he can't save himself . If he is the king of Israel , he should come down from the cross ! Then we will believe him .
40027043	He trusted God , so let God save him , if he wants to . He even said he was God's Son . ”
40027044	The two criminals also said cruel things to Jesus .
40027045	At noon the sky turned dark and stayed that way until three o'clock .
40027046	Then about that time Jesus shouted , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” which means , “ My God , my God , why have you deserted me ? ”
40027047	Some of the people standing there heard Jesus and said , “ He's calling for Elijah . ”
40027048	One of them at once ran and grabbed a sponge . He soaked it in wine , then put it on a stick and held it up to Jesus .
40027049	Others said , “ Wait ! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him . ”
40027050	Once again Jesus shouted , and then he died .
40027051	At once the curtain in the temple was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook , and rocks split apart .
40027052	Graves opened , and many of God's people were raised to life .
40027053	They left their graves , and after Jesus had risen to life , they went into the holy city , where they were seen by many people .
40027054	The officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus felt the earthquake and saw everything else that happened . They were frightened and said , “ This man really was God's Son ! ”
40027055	Many women had come with Jesus from Galilee to be of help to him , and they were there , looking on at a distance .
40027056	Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of James and John were some of these women .
40027057	That evening a rich disciple named Joseph from the town of Arimathea
40027058	went and asked for Jesus' body . Pilate gave orders for it to be given to Joseph ,
40027059	who took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth .
40027060	Then Joseph put the body in his own tomb that had been cut into solid rock and had never been used . He rolled a big stone against the entrance to the tomb and went away .
40027061	All this time Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb .
40027062	On the next day , which was a Sabbath , the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate .
40027063	They said , “ Sir , we remember what this liar said while he was still alive . He claimed in three days he would come back from death .
40027064	So please order the tomb to be carefully guarded for three days . If you don't , his disciples may come and steal his body . They will tell the people he has been raised to life , and this last lie will be worse than the first one . ”
40027065	Pilate said to them , “ All right , take some of your soldiers and guard the tomb as well as you know how . ”
40027066	So they sealed it tight and placed soldiers there to guard it .
40028001	The Sabbath was over , and it was almost daybreak on Sunday when Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb .
40028002	Suddenly a strong earthquake struck , and the Lord's angel came down from heaven . He rolled away the stone and sat on it .
40028003	The angel looked as bright as lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
40028004	The guards shook from fear and fell down , as though they were dead .
40028005	The angel said to the women , “ Don't be afraid ! I know you are looking for Jesus , who was nailed to a cross .
40028006	He isn't here ! God has raised him to life , just as Jesus said he would . Come , see the place where his body was lying .
40028007	Now hurry ! Tell his disciples he has been raised to life and is on his way to Galilee . Go there , and you will see him . This is what I came to tell you . ”
40028008	The women were frightened and yet very happy , as they hurried from the tomb and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	Suddenly Jesus met them and greeted them . They went near him , held on to his feet , and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said , “ Don't be afraid ! Tell my followers to go to Galilee . They will see me there . ”
40028011	While the women were on their way , some soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city . They told the chief priests everything that had happened .
40028012	So the chief priests met with the leaders and decided to bribe the soldiers with a lot of money .
40028013	They said to the soldiers , “ Tell everyone that Jesus' disciples came during the night and stole his body while you were asleep .
40028014	If the governor hears about this , we will talk to him . You won't have anything to worry about . ”
40028015	The soldiers took the money and did what they were told . The people of Judea still tell each other this story .
40028016	Jesus' eleven disciples went to a mountain in Galilee , where Jesus had told them to meet him .
40028017	They saw him and worshiped him , but some of them doubted .
40028018	Jesus came to them and said :
41001001	This is the good news about Jesus Christ , the Son of God .
41001002	It began just as God had said in the book written by Isaiah the prophet , “ I am sending my messenger to get the way ready for you .
41001003	In the desert someone is shouting , ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ! Make a straight path for him . ’ ”
41001004	So John the Baptist showed up in the desert and told everyone , “ Turn back to God and be baptized ! Then your sins will be forgiven . ”
41001005	From all Judea and Jerusalem crowds of people went to John . They told how sorry they were for their sins , and he baptized them in the Jordan River .
41001006	John wore clothes made of camel's hair . He had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey .
41001007	John also told the people , “ Someone more powerful is going to come . And I am not good enough even to stoop down and untie his sandals .
41001008	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit ! ”
41001009	About that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee , and John baptized him in the Jordan River .
41001010	As soon as Jesus came out of the water , he saw the sky open and the Holy Spirit coming down to him like a dove .
41001011	A voice from heaven said , “ You are my own dear Son , and I am pleased with you . ”
41001012	At once God's Spirit made Jesus go into the desert .
41001013	He stayed there for 40 days while Satan tested him . Jesus was with the wild animals , but angels took care of him .
41001014	After John was arrested , Jesus went to Galilee and told the good news that comes from God .
41001015	He said , “ The time has come ! God's kingdom will soon be here . Turn back to God and believe the good news ! ”
41001016	As Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew . They were fishermen and were casting their nets into the lake .
41001017	Jesus said to them , “ Follow me ! I will teach you how to bring in people instead of fish . ”
41001018	Right then the two brothers dropped their nets and went with him .
41001019	Jesus walked on and soon saw James and John , the sons of Zebedee . They were in a boat , mending their nets .
41001020	At once Jesus asked them to come with him . They left their father in the boat with the hired workers and went with him .
41001021	Jesus and his disciples went to the town of Capernaum . Then on the next Sabbath he went into the synagogue and started teaching .
41001022	Everyone was amazed at his teaching . He taught with authority , and not like the teachers of the Law of Moses .
41001023	Suddenly a man with an evil spirit in him entered the synagogue and yelled ,
41001024	“ Jesus from Nazareth , what do you want with us ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are ! You are God's Holy One . ”
41001025	Jesus told the evil spirit , “ Be quiet and come out of the man ! ”
41001026	The spirit shook him . Then it gave a loud shout and left .
41001027	Everyone was completely surprised and kept saying to each other , “ What is this ? It must be some new kind of powerful teaching ! Even the evil spirits obey him . ”
41001028	News about Jesus quickly spread all over Galilee .
41001029	As soon as Jesus left the synagogue with James and John , they went home with Simon and Andrew .
41001030	When they got there , Jesus was told that Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with fever .
41001031	Jesus went to her . He took hold of her hand and helped her up . The fever left her , and she served them a meal .
41001032	That evening after sunset , all who were sick or had demons in them were brought to Jesus .
41001033	In fact , the whole town gathered around the door of the house .
41001034	Jesus healed all kinds of terrible diseases and forced out a lot of demons . But the demons knew who he was , and he did not let them speak .
41001035	Very early the next morning before daylight , Jesus got up and went to a place where he could be alone and pray .
41001036	Simon and the others started looking for him .
41001037	And when they found him , they said , “ Everyone is looking for you ! ”
41001038	Jesus replied , “ We must go to the nearby towns , so that I can tell the good news to those people . This is why I have come . ”
41001039	Then Jesus went to their synagogues everywhere in Galilee , where he preached and forced out demons .
41001040	A man with leprosy came to Jesus and knelt down . He begged , “ You have the power to make me well , if only you wanted to . ”
41001041	Jesus felt sorry for the man . So he put his hand on him and said , “ I want to ! Now you are well . ”
41001042	At once the man's leprosy disappeared , and he was well .
41001043	After Jesus strictly warned the man , he sent him on his way .
41001044	He said , “ Don't tell anyone about this . Just go and show the priest that you are well . Then take a gift to the temple as Moses commanded , and everyone will know that you have been healed . ”
41001045	The man talked about it so much and told so many people , that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town . He had to stay away from the towns , but people still came to him from everywhere .
41002001	Jesus went back to Capernaum , and a few days later people heard that he was at home .
41002002	Then so many of them came to the house that there wasn't even standing room left in front of the door . Jesus was still teaching
41002003	when four people came up , carrying a man on a mat because he could not walk .
41002004	But because of the crowd , they could not get him to Jesus . So they made a hole in the roof above him and let the man down in front of everyone .
41002005	When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the man , “ My friend , your sins are forgiven . ”
41002006	Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were sitting there . They started wondering ,
41002007	“ Why would he say such a thing ? He must think he is God ! Only God can forgive sins . ”
41002008	At once , Jesus knew what they were thinking , and he said , “ Why are you thinking such things ?
41002009	Is it easier for me to tell this man his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and pick up his mat and go on home ?
41002010	I will show you that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth . ” So Jesus said to the man ,
41002011	“ Get up ! Pick up your mat and go on home . ”
41002012	The man got right up . He picked up his mat and went out while everyone watched in amazement . They praised God and said , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ”
41002013	Once again , Jesus went to the shore of Lake Galilee . A large crowd gathered around him , and he taught them .
41002014	As he walked along , he saw Levi , the son of Alphaeus . Levi was sitting at the place for paying taxes , and Jesus said to him , “ Follow me ! ” So he got up and went with Jesus .
41002015	Later , Jesus and his disciples were having dinner at Levi's house . Many tax collectors and other sinners had become followers of Jesus , and they were also guests at the dinner .
41002016	Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees , and they saw Jesus eating with sinners and tax collectors . So they asked his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
41002017	Jesus heard them and answered , “ Healthy people don't need a doctor , but sick people do . I didn't come to invite good people to be my followers . I came to invite sinners . ”
41002018	The followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees often went without eating . Some people came and asked Jesus , “ Why do the followers of John and those of the Pharisees often go without eating , while your disciples never do ? ”
41002019	Jesus answered :
41002023	One Sabbath Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields . His disciples were picking grains of wheat as they went along .
41002024	Some Pharisees asked Jesus , “ Why are your disciples picking grain on the Sabbath ? They are not supposed to do that ! ”
41002025	Jesus answered , “ Haven't you read what David did when he and his followers were hungry and in need ?
41002026	It was during the time of Abiathar the high priest . David went into the house of God and ate the sacred loaves of bread that only priests are allowed to eat . He also gave some to his followers . ”
41002027	Jesus finished by saying , “ People were not made for the good of the Sabbath . The Sabbath was made for the good of people .
41002028	So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath . ”
41003001	The next time Jesus went into the synagogue , a man with a paralyzed hand was there .
41003002	The Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong , and they kept watching to see if Jesus would heal him on the Sabbath .
41003003	Jesus told the man to stand up where everyone could see him .
41003004	Then he asked , “ On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds ? Should we save someone's life or destroy it ? ” But no one said a word .
41003005	Jesus was angry as he looked around at the people . Yet he felt sorry for them because they were so stubborn . Then he told the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He did , and his bad hand was healed .
41003006	The Pharisees left . And at once they started making plans with Herod's followers to kill Jesus .
41003007	Jesus led his disciples down to the shore of the lake . Large crowds followed him from Galilee , Judea ,
41003008	and Jerusalem . People came from Idumea , as well as other places east of the Jordan River . They also came from the region around the towns of Tyre and Sidon . All of these crowds came because they had heard what Jesus was doing .
41003009	He even had to tell his disciples to get a boat ready to keep him from being crushed by the crowds .
41003010	After Jesus had healed many people , the other sick people begged him to let them touch him .
41003011	And whenever any evil spirits saw Jesus , they would fall to the ground and shout , “ You are the Son of God ! ”
41003012	But Jesus warned the spirits not to tell who he was .
41003013	Jesus decided to ask some of his disciples to go up on a mountain with him , and they went .
41003014	Then he chose twelve of them to be his apostles , so they could be with him . He also wanted to send them out to preach
41003015	and to force out demons .
41003016	Simon was one of the twelve , and Jesus named him Peter .
41003017	There were also James and John , the two sons of Zebedee . Jesus called them Boanerges , which means “ Thunderbolts . ”
41003018	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus were also apostles . The others were Simon , known as the Eager One ,
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who later betrayed Jesus .
41003020	Jesus went back home , and once again such a large crowd gathered that there was no chance even to eat .
41003021	When Jesus' family heard what he was doing , they thought he was crazy and went to get him under control .
41003022	Some teachers of the Law of Moses came from Jerusalem and said , “ This man is under the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of demons ! He is even forcing out demons with the help of Beelzebul . ”
41003023	Jesus told the people to gather around him . Then he spoke to them in riddles and said :
41003030	Jesus said this because the people were saying that he had an evil spirit in him .
41003031	Jesus' mother and brothers came and stood outside . Then they sent someone with a message for him to come out to them .
41003032	The crowd sitting around Jesus told him , “ Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want to see you . ”
41003033	Jesus asked , “ Who is my mother and who are my brothers ? ”
41003034	Then he looked at the people sitting around him and said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers .
41003035	Anyone who obeys God is my brother or sister or mother . ”
41004001	The next time Jesus taught beside Lake Galilee , a big crowd gathered . It was so large that he had to sit in a boat out on the lake , while the people stood on the shore .
41004002	He used stories to teach them many things , and this is part of what he taught :
41004009	Then Jesus said , “ If you have ears , pay attention . ”
41004010	When Jesus was alone with the twelve apostles and some others , they asked him about these stories .
41004011	He answered : “ These people will look and look , but never see . They will listen and listen , but never understand . If they did , they would turn to God and be forgiven . ”
41004013	Jesus then told them :
41004021	Jesus also said :
41004026	Again Jesus said :
41004030	Finally , Jesus said :
41004033	Jesus used many other stories when he spoke to the people , and he taught them as much as they could understand .
41004034	He did not tell them anything without using stories . But when he was alone with his disciples , he explained everything to them .
41004035	That evening , Jesus said to his disciples , “ Let's cross to the east side . ”
41004036	So they left the crowd , and his disciples started across the lake with him in the boat . Some other boats followed along .
41004037	Suddenly a storm struck the lake . Waves started splashing into the boat , and it was about to sink .
41004038	Jesus was in the back of the boat with his head on a pillow , and he was asleep . His disciples woke him and said , “ Teacher , don't you care that we're about to drown ? ”
41004039	Jesus got up and ordered the wind and the waves to be quiet . The wind stopped , and everything was calm .
41004040	Jesus asked his disciples , “ Why were you afraid ? Don't you have any faith ? ”
41004041	Now they were more afraid than ever and said to each other , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! ”
41005001	Jesus and his disciples crossed Lake Galilee and came to shore near the town of Gerasa .
41005002	When he was getting out of the boat , a man with an evil spirit quickly ran to him
41005003	from the graveyard where he had been living . No one was able to tie the man up anymore , not even with a chain .
41005004	He had often been put in chains and leg irons , but he broke the chains and smashed the leg irons . No one could control him .
41005005	Night and day he was in the graveyard or on the hills , yelling and cutting himself with stones .
41005006	When the man saw Jesus in the distance , he ran up to him and knelt down .
41005007	He shouted , “ Jesus , Son of God in heaven , what do you want with me ? Promise me in God's name that you won't torture me ! ”
41005008	The man said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to come out of him .
41005009	Jesus asked , “ What is your name ? ” The man answered , “ My name is Lots , because I have ‘ lots ’ of evil spirits . ”
41005010	He then begged Jesus not to send them away .
41005011	Over on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding .
41005012	So the evil spirits begged Jesus , “ Send us into those pigs ! Let us go into them . ”
41005013	Jesus let them go , and they went out of the man and into the pigs . The whole herd of about 2,000 pigs rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned .
41005014	The men taking care of the pigs ran to the town and the farms to spread the news . Then the people came out to see what had happened .
41005015	When they came to Jesus , they saw the man who had once been full of demons . He was sitting there with his clothes on and in his right mind , and they were terrified .
41005016	Everyone who had seen what had happened told about the man and the pigs .
41005017	Then the people started begging Jesus to leave their part of the country .
41005018	When Jesus was getting into the boat , the man begged to go with him .
41005019	But Jesus would not let him . Instead , he said , “ Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how good he has been to you . ”
41005020	The man went away into the region near the ten cities known as Decapolis and began telling everyone how much Jesus had done for him . Everyone who heard what had happened was amazed .
41005021	Once again Jesus got into the boat and crossed Lake Galilee . Then as he stood on the shore , a large crowd gathered around him .
41005022	The person in charge of the synagogue was also there . His name was Jairus , and when he saw Jesus , he went over to him . He knelt at Jesus' feet
41005023	and started begging him for help . He said , “ My little daughter is about to die ! Please come and touch her , so she will get well and live . ”
41005024	Jesus went with Jairus . Many people followed along and kept crowding around .
41005025	In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years .
41005026	She had gone to many doctors , and they had not done anything except cause her a lot of pain . She had paid them all the money she had . But instead of getting better , she only got worse .
41005027	The woman had heard about Jesus , so she came up behind him in the crowd and barely touched his clothes .
41005028	She had said to herself , “ If I can just touch his clothes , I will be healed . ”
41005029	As soon as she touched them , her bleeding stopped , and she knew she was healed .
41005030	At that moment Jesus felt power go out from him . He turned to the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
41005031	His disciples said to him , “ Look at all these people crowding around you ! How can you ask who touched you ? ”
41005032	But Jesus turned to see who had touched him .
41005033	The woman knew what had happened to her . So she came trembling with fear and knelt down in front of Jesus . Then she told him the whole story .
41005034	Jesus said to the woman , “ You are now well because of your faith . May God give you peace ! You are healed , and you will no longer be in pain . ”
41005035	While Jesus was still speaking , some people came from Jairus' home and said , “ Your daughter has died ! Why bother the teacher anymore ? ”
41005036	Jesus heard what they said , and he said to Jairus , “ Don't worry . Just have faith ! ”
41005037	Jesus did not let anyone go with him except Peter and the two brothers , James and John .
41005038	They went home with Jairus and saw the people crying and making a lot of noise .
41005039	Then Jesus went inside and said to them , “ Why are you crying and carrying on like this ? The child isn't dead . She is just asleep . ”
41005040	But the people laughed at him . After Jesus had sent them all out of the house , he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples and went to where she was .
41005043	But Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened . Then he said , “ Give her something to eat . ”
41006001	Jesus left and returned to his hometown with his disciples .
41006002	The next Sabbath he taught in the synagogue . Many of the people who heard him were amazed and asked , “ How can he do all this ? Where did he get such wisdom and the power to work these miracles ?
41006003	Isn't he the carpenter , the son of Mary ? Aren't James , Joseph , Judas , and Simon his brothers ? Don't his sisters still live here in our town ? ” The people were upset because of what he was doing .
41006004	But Jesus said , “ Prophets are honored by everyone , except the people of their hometown and their relatives and their own family . ”
41006005	Jesus could not work any miracles there , except to heal a few sick people by placing his hands on them .
41006006	He was surprised that the people did not have any faith . Jesus taught in all the neighboring villages .
41006007	Then he called together his twelve apostles and sent them out two by two with power over evil spirits .
41006008	He told them , “ You may take along a walking stick . But don't carry food or a traveling bag or any money .
41006009	It's all right to wear sandals , but don't take along a change of clothes .
41006010	When you are welcomed into a home , stay there until you leave that town .
41006011	If any place won't welcome you or listen to your message , leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them . ”
41006012	The apostles left and started telling everyone to turn to God .
41006013	They forced out many demons and healed a lot of sick people by putting olive oil on them .
41006014	Jesus became so well-known that Herod the ruler heard about him . Some people thought he was John the Baptist , who had come back to life with the power to work miracles .
41006015	Others thought he was Elijah or some other prophet who had lived long ago .
41006016	But when Herod heard about Jesus , he said , “ This must be John ! I had his head cut off , and now he has come back to life . ”
41006019	Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him . But she could not do it
41006020	because Herod was afraid of John and protected him . He knew that John was a good and holy man . Even though Herod was confused by what John said , he was glad to listen to him . And he often did .
41006021	Finally , Herodias got her chance when Herod gave a great birthday celebration for himself and invited his officials , his army officers , and the leaders of Galilee .
41006022	The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for Herod and his guests . She pleased them so much that Herod said , “ Ask for anything , and it's yours !
41006023	I swear that I will give you as much as half of my kingdom , if you want it . ”
41006024	The girl left and asked her mother , “ What do you think I should ask for ? ” Her mother answered , “ The head of John the Baptist ! ”
41006025	The girl hurried back and told Herod , “ Here and now on a serving plate I want the head of John the Baptist ! ”
41006026	Herod was very sorry for what he had said . But he did not want to break the promise he had made in front of his guests .
41006027	At once he ordered a guard to cut off John's head there in prison .
41006028	The guard put the head on a serving plate and took it to the girl . Then she gave it to her mother .
41006029	When John's followers learned that he had been killed , they took his body and put it in a tomb .
41006030	After the apostles returned to Jesus , they told him everything they had done and taught .
41006031	But so many people were coming and going that Jesus and the apostles did not even have a chance to eat . Then Jesus said , “ Let's go to a place where we can be alone and get some rest . ”
41006032	They left in a boat for a place where they could be alone .
41006033	But many people saw them leave and figured out where they were going . So people from every town ran on ahead and got there first .
41006034	When Jesus got out of the boat , he saw the large crowd that was like sheep without a shepherd . He felt sorry for the people and started teaching them many things .
41006035	That evening the disciples came to Jesus and said , “ This place is like a desert , and it's already late .
41006036	Let the crowds leave , so they can go to the farms and villages near here and buy something to eat . ”
41006037	Jesus replied , “ You give them something to eat . ” But they asked him , “ Don't you know it would take almost a year's wages to buy all of these people something to eat ? ”
41006038	Then Jesus said , “ How much bread do you have ? Go and see ! ” They found out and answered , “ We have five small loaves of bread and two fish . ”
41006039	Jesus told his disciples to tell the people to sit down on the green grass .
41006040	They sat down in groups of 100 and groups of 50 .
41006041	Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up toward heaven and blessed the food . Then he broke the bread and handed it to his disciples to give to the people . He also divided the two fish , so everyone could have some .
41006042	After everyone had eaten all they wanted ,
41006043	Jesus' disciples picked up twelve large baskets of leftover bread and fish .
41006044	There were 5,000 men who ate the food .
41006045	At once , Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and start back across to Bethsaida . But he stayed until he had sent the crowds away .
41006046	Then he told them goodbye and went up on the side of a mountain to pray .
41006047	Later in the evening he was still there by himself , and the boat was somewhere in the middle of the lake .
41006048	He could see that the disciples were struggling hard , because they were rowing against the wind . Not long before morning , Jesus came toward them . He was walking on the water and was about to pass the boat .
41006049	When the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water , they thought he was a ghost , and they started screaming .
41006050	All of them saw him and were terrified . But at this same time he said , “ Don't worry ! I am Jesus . Don't be afraid . ”
41006051	He then got into the boat with them , and the wind died down . The disciples were completely confused .
41006052	Their minds were closed , and they could not understand the true meaning of the loaves of bread .
41006053	Jesus and his disciples crossed the lake and brought the boat to shore near the town of Gennesaret .
41006054	As soon as they got out of the boat , the people recognized Jesus .
41006055	So they ran all over that part of the country to bring their sick people to him on mats . They brought them each time they heard where he was .
41006056	In every village or farm or marketplace where Jesus went , the people brought their sick to him . They begged him to let them just touch his clothes , and everyone who did was healed .
41007001	Some Pharisees and several teachers of the Law of Moses from Jerusalem came and gathered around Jesus .
41007002	They noticed that some of his disciples ate without first washing their hands .
41007003	The Pharisees and many others obey the teachings of their ancestors . They always wash their hands in the proper way before eating .
41007004	None of them will eat anything they buy in the market until it is washed . They also follow a lot of other teachings , such as washing cups , pitchers , and bowls .
41007005	The Pharisees and teachers asked Jesus , “ Why don't your disciples obey what our ancestors taught us to do ? Why do they eat without washing their hands ? ”
41007006	Jesus replied : “ All of you praise me with your words , but you never really think about me .
41007007	It is useless for you to worship me , when you teach rules made up by humans . ”
41007014	Jesus called the crowd together again and said , “ Pay attention and try to understand what I mean .
41007017	After Jesus and his disciples had left the crowd and gone into the house , they asked him what these sayings meant .
41007018	He answered , “ Don't you know what I am talking about by now ? You surely know that the food you put into your mouth cannot make you unclean .
41007019	It doesn't go into your heart , but into your stomach , and then out of your body . ” By saying this , Jesus meant that all foods were fit to eat .
41007020	Then Jesus said :
41007024	Jesus left and went to the region near the town of Tyre , where he stayed in someone's home . He did not want people to know he was there , but they found out anyway .
41007025	A woman whose daughter had an evil spirit in her heard where Jesus was . And at once she came and knelt down at his feet .
41007026	The woman was Greek and had been born in the part of Syria known as Phoenicia . She begged Jesus to force the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	But Jesus said , “ The children must first be fed ! It isn't right to take away their food and feed it to dogs . ”
41007028	The woman replied , “ Lord , even puppies eat the crumbs that children drop from the table . ”
41007029	Jesus answered , “ That's true ! You may go now . The demon has left your daughter . ”
41007030	When the woman got back home , she found her child lying on the bed . The demon had gone .
41007031	Jesus left the region around Tyre and went by way of Sidon toward Lake Galilee . He went through the land near the ten cities known as Decapolis .
41007032	Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk . They begged Jesus just to touch him .
41007033	After Jesus had taken him aside from the crowd , he stuck his fingers in the man's ears . Then he spit and put it on the man's tongue .
41007034	Jesus looked up toward heaven , and with a groan he said , “ Effatha ! ” which means “ Open up ! ”
41007035	At once the man could hear , and he had no more trouble talking clearly .
41007036	Jesus told the people not to say anything about what he had done . But the more he told them , the more they talked about it .
41007037	They were completely amazed and said , “ Everything he does is good ! He even heals people who cannot hear or talk . ”
41008001	One day another large crowd gathered around Jesus . They had not brought along anything to eat . So Jesus called his disciples together and said ,
41008002	“ I feel sorry for these people . They have been with me for three days , and they don't have anything to eat .
41008003	Some of them live a long way from here . If I send them away hungry , they might faint on their way home . ”
41008004	The disciples said , “ This place is like a desert . Where can we find enough food to feed such a crowd ? ”
41008005	Jesus asked them how much food they had . They replied , “ Seven small loaves of bread . ”
41008006	After Jesus told the crowd to sit down , he took the seven loaves and gave thanks . He then broke the loaves and handed them to his disciples , who passed them out to the crowd .
41008007	They also had a few little fish , and after Jesus had blessed these , he told the disciples to pass them around .
41008010	he got into the boat with the disciples and crossed to the territory near Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came out and started an argument with Jesus . They wanted to test him by asking for a sign from heaven .
41008012	Jesus groaned and said , “ Why are you always looking for a sign ? I can promise you that you will not be given one ! ”
41008013	Then he left them . He again got into a boat and crossed over to the other side of the lake .
41008014	The disciples had forgotten to bring any bread , and they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
41008015	Jesus warned them , “ Watch out ! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod . ”
41008016	The disciples talked this over and said to each other , “ He must be saying this because we don't have any bread . ”
41008017	Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked , “ Why are you talking about not having any bread ? Don't you understand ? Are your minds still closed ?
41008018	Are your eyes blind and your ears deaf ? Don't you remember
41008019	how many baskets of leftovers you picked up when I fed those 5,000 people with only five small loaves of bread ? ” “ Yes , ” the disciples answered . “ There were twelve baskets . ”
41008020	Jesus then asked , “ And how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up when I broke seven small loaves of bread for those 4,000 people ? ” “ Seven , ” they answered .
41008021	“ Don't you know what I am talking about by now ? ” Jesus asked .
41008022	As Jesus and his disciples were going into Bethsaida , some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch the man .
41008023	Jesus took him by the hand and led him out of the village , where he spit into the man's eyes . He placed his hands on the blind man and asked him if he could see anything .
41008024	The man looked up and said , “ I see people , but they look like trees walking around . ”
41008025	Once again Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes , and this time the man stared . His eyes were healed , and he saw everything clearly .
41008026	Jesus said to him , “ You may return home now , but don't go into the village . ”
41008027	Jesus and his disciples went to the villages near the town of Caesarea Philippi . As they were walking along , he asked them , “ What do people say about me ? ”
41008028	The disciples answered , “ Some say you are John the Baptist or maybe Elijah . Others say you are one of the prophets . ”
41008029	Then Jesus asked , “ But who do you say I am ? ” “ You are the Messiah ! ” Peter replied .
41008030	Jesus warned the disciples not to tell anyone about him .
41008031	Jesus began telling his disciples what would happen to him . He said , “ The nation's leaders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make the Son of Man suffer terribly . He will be rejected and killed , but three days later he will rise to life . ”
41008032	Then Jesus explained clearly what he meant . Peter took Jesus aside and told him to stop talking like that .
41008033	But when Jesus turned and saw the disciples , he corrected Peter . He said to him , “ Satan , get away from me ! You are thinking like everyone else and not like God . ”
41008034	Jesus then told the crowd and the disciples to come closer , and he said :
41009002	Six days later Jesus took Peter , James , and John with him . They went up on a high mountain , where they could be alone . There in front of the disciples , Jesus was completely changed .
41009003	And his clothes became much whiter than any bleach on earth could make them .
41009004	Then Elijah and Moses appeared and were talking with Jesus .
41009005	Peter said to Jesus , “ Teacher , it is good for us to be here ! Let us make three shelters , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ”
41009006	But Peter and the others were terribly frightened , and he did not know what he was talking about .
41009007	The shadow of a cloud passed over and covered them . From the cloud a voice said , “ This is my Son , and I love him . Listen to what he says ! ”
41009008	At once the disciples looked around , but they saw only Jesus .
41009009	As Jesus and his disciples were coming down the mountain , he told them not to say a word about what they had seen , until the Son of Man had been raised from death .
41009010	So they kept it to themselves . But they wondered what he meant by the words “ raised from death . ”
41009011	The disciples asked Jesus , “ Don't the teachers of the Law of Moses say that Elijah must come before the Messiah does ? ”
41009012	Jesus answered :
41009014	When Jesus and his three disciples came back down , they saw a large crowd around the other disciples . The teachers of the Law of Moses were arguing with them .
41009015	The crowd was really surprised to see Jesus , and everyone hurried over to greet him .
41009016	Jesus asked , “ What are you arguing about ? ”
41009017	Someone from the crowd answered , “ Teacher , I brought my son to you . A demon keeps him from talking .
41009018	Whenever the demon attacks my son , it throws him to the ground and makes him foam at the mouth and grit his teeth in pain . Then he becomes stiff . I asked your disciples to force out the demon , but they couldn't do it . ”
41009019	Jesus said , “ You people don't have any faith ! How much longer must I be with you ? Why do I have to put up with you ? Bring the boy to me . ”
41009020	They brought the boy , and as soon as the demon saw Jesus , it made the boy shake all over . He fell down and began rolling on the ground and foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked the boy's father , “ How long has he been like this ? ” The man answered , “ Ever since he was a child .
41009022	The demon has often tried to kill him by throwing him into a fire or into water . Please have pity and help us if you can ! ”
41009023	Jesus replied , “ Why do you say ‘ if you can ’ ? Anything is possible for someone who has faith ! ”
41009024	At once the boy's father shouted , “ I do have faith ! Please help me to have even more . ”
41009025	When Jesus saw that a crowd was gathering fast , he spoke sternly to the evil spirit that had kept the boy from speaking or hearing . He said , “ I order you to come out of the boy ! Don't ever bother him again . ”
41009026	The spirit screamed and made the boy shake all over . Then it went out of him . The boy looked dead , and almost everyone said he was .
41009027	But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .
41009028	After Jesus and the disciples had gone back home and were alone , they asked him , “ Why couldn't we force out that demon ? ”
41009029	Jesus answered , “ Only prayer can force out this kind of demon . ”
41009030	Jesus left with his disciples and started through Galilee . He did not want anyone to know about it ,
41009031	because he was teaching the disciples that the Son of Man would be handed over to people who would kill him . But three days later he would rise to life .
41009032	The disciples did not understand what Jesus meant , and they were afraid to ask .
41009033	Jesus and his disciples went to his home in Capernaum . After they were inside the house , Jesus asked them , “ What were you arguing about along the way ? ”
41009034	They had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest , and so they did not answer .
41009035	After Jesus sat down and told the twelve disciples to gather around him , he said , “ If you want the place of honor , you must become a slave and serve others ! ”
41009036	Then Jesus asked a child to stand near him . He put his arm around the child and said ,
41009037	“ When you welcome even a child because of me , you welcome me . And when you welcome me , you welcome the one who sent me . ”
41009038	John said , “ Teacher , we saw a man using your name to force demons out of people . But he wasn't one of us , and we told him to stop . ”
41009039	Jesus said to his disciples :
41010001	After Jesus left , he went to Judea and then on to the other side of the Jordan River . Once again large crowds came to him , and as usual , he taught them .
41010002	Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus . So they came up to him and asked if it was right for a man to divorce his wife .
41010003	Jesus asked them , “ What does the Law of Moses say about this ? ”
41010004	They answered , “ Moses allows a man to write out divorce papers and send his wife away . ”
41010005	Jesus replied , “ Moses gave you this law because you are so heartless .
41010006	But in the beginning God made a man and a woman .
41010007	That's why a man leaves his father and mother and gets married .
41010008	He becomes like one person with his wife . Then they are no longer two people , but one .
41010009	And no one should separate a couple that God has joined together . ”
41010010	When Jesus and his disciples were back in the house , they asked him about what he had said .
41010011	He told them , “ A man who divorces his wife and marries someone else is unfaithful to his wife .
41010012	A woman who divorces her husband and marries again is also unfaithful . ”
41010013	Some people brought their children to Jesus so he could bless them by placing his hands on them . But his disciples told the people to stop bothering him .
41010014	When Jesus saw this , he became angry and said , “ Let the children come to me ! Don't try to stop them . People who are like these little children belong to the kingdom of God .
41010015	I promise you that you cannot get into God's kingdom , unless you accept it the way a child does . ”
41010016	Then Jesus took the children in his arms and blessed them by placing his hands on them .
41010017	As Jesus was walking down a road , a man ran up to him . He knelt down , and asked , “ Good teacher , what can I do to have eternal life ? ”
41010018	Jesus replied , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
41010019	You know the commandments . ‘ Do not murder . Be faithful in marriage . Do not steal . Do not tell lies about others . Do not cheat . Respect your father and mother . ’ ”
41010020	The man answered , “ Teacher , I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man . ”
41010021	Jesus looked closely at the man . He liked him and said , “ There's one thing you still need to do . Go sell everything you own . Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come with me . ”
41010022	When the man heard Jesus say this , he went away gloomy and sad because he was very rich .
41010023	Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , “ It's hard for rich people to get into God's kingdom ! ”
41010024	The disciples were shocked to hear this . So Jesus told them again , “ It's terribly hard to get into God's kingdom !
41010025	In fact , it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom . ”
41010026	Jesus' disciples were even more amazed . They asked each other , “ How can anyone ever be saved ? ”
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , “ There are some things that people cannot do , but God can do anything . ”
41010028	Peter replied , “ Remember , we left everything to be your followers ! ”
41010029	Jesus told him :
41010032	The disciples were confused as Jesus led them toward Jerusalem , and his other followers were afraid . Once again , Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and told them what was going to happen to him . He said :
41010035	James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came up to Jesus and asked , “ Teacher , will you do us a favor ? ”
41010036	Jesus asked them what they wanted ,
41010037	and they answered , “ When you come into your glory , please let one of us sit at your right side and the other at your left . ”
41010038	Jesus told them , “ You don't really know what you're asking ! Are you able to drink from the cup that I must soon drink from or be baptized as I must be baptized ? ”
41010039	“ Yes , we are ! ” James and John answered . Then Jesus replied , “ You certainly will drink from the cup from which I must drink . And you will be baptized just as I must !
41010040	But it isn't for me to say who will sit at my right side and at my left . This is for God to decide . ”
41010041	When the ten other disciples heard this , they were angry with James and John .
41010042	But Jesus called the disciples together and said :
41010046	Jesus and his disciples went to Jericho . And as they were leaving , they were followed by a large crowd . A blind beggar by the name of Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting beside the road .
41010047	When he heard that it was Jesus from Nazareth , he shouted , “ Jesus , Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
41010048	Many people told the man to stop , but he shouted even louder , “ Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him over ! ” They called out to the blind man and said , “ Don't be afraid ! Come on ! He is calling for you . ”
41010050	The man threw off his coat as he jumped up and ran to Jesus .
41010051	Jesus asked , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man answered , “ Master , I want to see ! ”
41010052	Jesus told him , “ You may go . Your eyes are healed because of your faith . ” At once the man could see , and he went down the road with Jesus .
41011001	Jesus and his disciples reached Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives . When they were getting close to Jerusalem , Jesus sent two of them on ahead .
41011002	He told them , “ Go into the next village . As soon as you enter it , you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden . Untie the donkey and bring it here .
41011003	If anyone asks why you are doing this , say , ‘ The Lord needs it and will soon bring it back . ’ ”
41011004	The disciples left and found the donkey tied near a door that faced the street . While they were untying it ,
41011005	some of the people standing there asked , “ Why are you untying the donkey ? ”
41011006	They told them what Jesus had said , and the people let them take it .
41011007	The disciples led the donkey to Jesus . They put some of their clothes on its back , and Jesus got on .
41011008	Many people spread clothes on the road , while others spread branches they had cut from the fields .
41011009	In front of Jesus and behind him , people went along shouting , “ Hooray ! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord !
41011010	God bless the coming kingdom of our ancestor David . Hooray for God in heaven above ! ”
41011011	After Jesus had gone to Jerusalem , he went into the temple and looked around at everything . But since it was already late in the day , he went back to Bethany with the twelve disciples .
41011012	When Jesus and his disciples left Bethany the next morning , he was hungry .
41011013	From a distance Jesus saw a fig tree covered with leaves , and he went to see if there were any figs on the tree . But there were none , because it wasn't the season for figs .
41011014	So Jesus said to the tree , “ Never again will anyone eat fruit from this tree ! ” The disciples heard him say this .
41011015	After Jesus and his disciples reached Jerusalem , he went into the temple and began chasing out everyone who was selling and buying . He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of those who were selling doves .
41011016	Jesus would not let anyone carry things through the temple .
41011017	Then he taught the people and said , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ My house should be called a place of worship for all nations . ’ But you have made it a place where robbers hide ! ”
41011018	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses heard what Jesus said , and they started looking for a way to kill him . They were afraid of him , because the crowds were completely amazed at his teaching .
41011019	That evening , Jesus and the disciples went outside the city .
41011020	As the disciples walked past the fig tree the next morning , they noticed that it was completely dried up , roots and all .
41011021	Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the tree . Then Peter said , “ Teacher , look ! The tree you put a curse on has dried up . ”
41011022	Jesus told his disciples :
41011027	Jesus and his disciples returned to Jerusalem . And as he was walking through the temple , the chief priests , the nation's leaders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses came over to him .
41011028	They asked , “ What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
41011029	Jesus answered , “ I have just one question to ask you . If you answer it , I will tell you where I got the right to do these things .
41011030	Who gave John the right to baptize ? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being ? ”
41011031	They thought it over and said to each other , “ We can't say that God gave John this right . Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John .
41011032	On the other hand , these people think that John was a prophet . So we can't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize . ” They were afraid of the crowd
41011033	and told Jesus , “ We don't know . ” Jesus replied , “ Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do . ”
41012001	Jesus then told them this story :
41012009	Jesus asked , “ What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do ? He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard .
41012010	You surely know that the Scriptures say , ‘ The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all .
41012011	This is something the Lord has done , and it is amazing to us . ’ ”
41012012	The leaders knew that Jesus was really talking about them , and they wanted to arrest him . But because they were afraid of the crowd , they let him alone and left .
41012013	The Pharisees got together with Herod's followers . Then they sent some men to trick Jesus into saying something wrong .
41012014	They went to him and said , “ Teacher , we know that you are honest . You treat everyone with the same respect , no matter who they are . And you teach the truth about what God wants people to do . Tell us , should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not ? ”
41012015	Jesus knew what they were up to , and he said , “ Why are you trying to test me ? Show me a coin ! ”
41012016	They brought him a silver coin , and he asked , “ Whose picture and name are on it ? ” “ The Emperor's , ” they answered .
41012017	Then Jesus told them , “ Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God . ” The men were amazed at Jesus .
41012018	The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death . So some of them came to Jesus and said :
41012024	Jesus answered :
41012028	One of the teachers of the Law of Moses came up while Jesus and the Sadducees were arguing . When he heard Jesus give a good answer , he asked him , “ What is the most important commandment ? ”
41012029	Jesus answered , “ The most important one says : ‘ People of Israel , you have only one Lord and God .
41012030	You must love him with all your heart , soul , mind , and strength . ’
41012031	The second most important commandment says : ‘ Love others as much as you love yourself . ’ No other commandment is more important than these . ”
41012032	The man replied , “ Teacher , you are certainly right to say there is only one God .
41012033	It is also true that we must love God with all our heart , mind , and strength , and that we must love others as much as we love ourselves . These commandments are more important than all the sacrifices and offerings that we could possibly make . ”
41012034	When Jesus saw that the man had given a sensible answer , he told him , “ You are not far from God's kingdom . ” After this , no one dared ask Jesus any more questions .
41012035	As Jesus was teaching in the temple , he said , “ How can the teachers of the Law of Moses say the Messiah will come from the family of King David ?
41012036	The Holy Spirit led David to say , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you . ’ The large crowd enjoyed listening to Jesus teach .
41012038	As Jesus was teaching , he said :
41012041	Jesus was sitting in the temple near the offering box and watching people put in their gifts . He noticed that many rich people were giving a lot of money .
41012042	Finally , a poor widow came up and put in two coins worth only a few pennies .
41012043	Jesus told his disciples to gather around him . Then he said :
41013001	As Jesus was leaving the temple , one of his disciples said to him , “ Teacher , look at these beautiful stones and wonderful buildings ! ”
41013002	Jesus replied , “ Do you see these huge buildings ? They will certainly be torn down ! Not one stone will be left in place . ”
41013003	Later , as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives across from the temple , Peter , James , John , and Andrew came to him in private .
41013004	They asked , “ When will these things happen ? What will be the sign that they are about to take place ? ”
41013005	Jesus answered : “ The sun will become dark , and the moon will no longer shine .
41013025	The stars will fall , and the powers in the sky will be shaken . ”
41014001	It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Thin Bread . The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were planning how they could sneak around and have Jesus arrested and put to death .
41014002	They were saying , “ We must not do it during the festival , because the people will riot . ”
41014003	Jesus was eating in Bethany at the home of Simon , who once had leprosy , when a woman came in with a very expensive bottle of sweet-smelling perfume . After breaking it open , she poured the perfume on Jesus' head .
41014004	This made some of the guests angry , and they complained , “ Why such a waste ?
41014005	We could have sold this perfume for more than 300 silver coins and given the money to the poor ! ” So they started saying cruel things to the woman .
41014006	But Jesus said :
41014010	Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve disciples . He went to the chief priests and offered to help them arrest Jesus .
41014011	They were glad to hear this , and they promised to pay him . So Judas started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus .
41014012	It was the first day of the Festival of Thin Bread , and the Passover lambs were being killed . Jesus' disciples asked him , “ Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal ? ”
41014013	Jesus said to two of the disciples , “ Go into the city , where you will meet a man carrying a jar of water . Follow him ,
41014014	and when he goes into a house , say to the owner , ‘ Our teacher wants to know if you have a room where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples . ’
41014015	The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room furnished and ready for you to use . Prepare the meal there . ”
41014016	The two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover meal .
41014019	This made the disciples sad , and one after another they said to Jesus , “ You surely don't mean me ! ”
41014020	He answered , “ It is one of you twelve men who is eating from this dish with me .
41014021	The Son of Man will die , just as the Scriptures say . But it is going to be terrible for the one who betrays me . That man would be better off if he had never been born . ”
41014022	During the meal Jesus took some bread in his hands . He blessed the bread and broke it . Then he gave it to his disciples and said , “ Take this . It is my body . ”
41014023	Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God . He gave it to his disciples , and they all drank some .
41014024	Then he said , “ This is my blood , which is poured out for many people , and with it God makes his agreement .
41014025	From now on I will not drink any wine , until I drink new wine in God's kingdom . ”
41014026	Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	Jesus said to his disciples , “ All of you will reject me , as the Scriptures say , ‘ I will strike down the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ’
41014029	Peter spoke up , “ Even if all the others reject you , I never will ! ”
41014030	Jesus replied , “ This very night before a rooster crows twice , you will say three times that you don't know me . ”
41014031	But Peter was so sure of himself that he said , “ Even if I have to die with you , I will never say I don't know you ! ” All the others said the same thing .
41014032	Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane , and he told them , “ Sit here while I pray . ”
41014033	Jesus took along Peter , James , and John . He was sad and troubled and
41014034	told them , “ I am so sad that I feel as if I am dying . Stay here and keep awake with me . ”
41014037	When Jesus came back and found the disciples sleeping , he said to Simon Peter , “ Are you asleep ? Can't you stay awake for just one hour ?
41014038	Stay awake and pray that you won't be tested . You want to do what is right , but you are weak . ”
41014039	Jesus went back and prayed the same prayer .
41014040	But when he returned to the disciples , he found them sleeping again . They simply could not keep their eyes open , and they did not know what to say .
41014041	When Jesus returned to the disciples the third time , he said , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough of this ! The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners .
41014042	Get up ! Let's go . The one who will betray me is already here . ”
41014043	Jesus was still speaking , when Judas the betrayer came up . He was one of the twelve disciples , and a mob of men armed with swords and clubs were with him . They had been sent by the chief priests , the nation's leaders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses .
41014044	Judas had told them ahead of time , “ Arrest the man I greet with a kiss . Tie him up tight and lead him away . ”
41014045	Judas walked right up to Jesus and said , “ Teacher ! ” Then Judas kissed him ,
41014046	and the men grabbed Jesus and arrested him .
41014047	Someone standing there pulled out a sword . He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
41014048	Jesus said to the mob , “ Why do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like a criminal ?
41014049	Day after day I was with you and taught in the temple , and you didn't arrest me . But what the Scriptures say must come true . ”
41014050	All of Jesus' disciples ran off and left him .
41014051	One of them was a young man who was wearing only a linen cloth . And when the men grabbed him ,
41014052	he left the cloth behind and ran away naked .
41014053	Jesus was led off to the high priest . Then the chief priests , the nation's leaders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses all met together .
41014054	Peter had followed at a distance , and when he reached the courtyard of the high priest's house , he sat down with the guards to warm himself beside a fire .
41014055	The chief priests and the whole council tried to find someone to accuse Jesus of a crime , so they could put him to death . But they could not find anyone to accuse him .
41014056	Many people did tell lies against Jesus , but they did not agree on what they said .
41014057	Finally , some men stood up and lied about him . They said ,
41014058	“ We heard him say he would tear down this temple that we built . He also claimed that in three days he would build another one without any help . ”
41014059	But even then they did not agree on what they said .
41014060	The high priest stood up in the council and asked Jesus , “ Why don't you say something in your own defense ? Don't you hear the charges they are making against you ? ”
41014061	But Jesus kept quiet and did not say a word . The high priest asked him another question , “ Are you the Messiah , the Son of the glorious God ? ”
41014062	“ Yes , I am ! ” Jesus answered . “ Soon you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All-Powerful , and coming with the clouds of heaven . ”
41014063	At once the high priest ripped his robe apart and shouted , “ Why do we need more witnesses ?
41014064	You heard him claim to be God ! What is your decision ? ” They all agreed he should be put to death .
41014065	Some of the people started spitting on Jesus . They blindfolded him , hit him with their fists , and said , “ Tell us who hit you ! ” Then the guards took charge of Jesus and beat him .
41014066	While Peter was still in the courtyard , a servant girl of the high priest came up
41014067	and saw Peter warming himself by the fire . She stared at him and said , “ You were with Jesus from Nazareth ! ”
41014068	Peter replied , “ That isn't true ! I don't know what you're talking about . I don't have any idea what you mean . ” He went out to the gate , and a rooster crowed .
41014069	The servant girl saw Peter again and said to the people standing there , “ This man is one of them ! ”
41014070	“ No , I'm not ! ” Peter replied . A little while later some of the people said to Peter , “ You certainly are one of them . You're a Galilean ! ”
41014071	This time Peter began to curse and swear , “ I don't even know the man you're talking about ! ”
41014072	At once the rooster crowed a second time . Then Peter remembered that Jesus had told him , “ Before a rooster crows twice , you will say three times that you don't know me . ” So Peter started crying .
41015001	Early the next morning the chief priests , the nation's leaders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses met together with the whole Jewish council . They tied up Jesus and led him off to Pilate .
41015002	He asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” “ Those are your words , ” Jesus answered .
41015003	The chief priests brought many charges against Jesus .
41015004	Then Pilate questioned him again , “ Don't you have anything to say ? Don't you hear what crimes they say you have done ? ”
41015005	But Jesus did not answer , and Pilate was amazed .
41015006	During Passover , Pilate always freed one prisoner chosen by the people .
41015007	And at that time there was a prisoner named Barabbas . He and some others had been arrested for murder during a riot .
41015008	The crowd now came and asked Pilate to set a prisoner free , just as he usually did .
41015009	Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to free the king of the Jews ? ”
41015010	Pilate knew that the chief priests had brought Jesus to him because they were jealous .
41015011	But the chief priests told the crowd to ask Pilate to free Barabbas .
41015012	Then Pilate asked the crowd , “ What do you want me to do with this man you say is the king of the Jews ? ”
41015013	They yelled , “ Nail him to a cross ! ”
41015014	Pilate asked , “ But what crime has he done ? ” “ Nail him to a cross ! ” they yelled even louder .
41015015	Pilate wanted to please the crowd , so he set Barabbas free . Then he ordered his soldiers to beat Jesus with a whip and nail him to a cross .
41015016	The soldiers led Jesus inside the courtyard of the fortress and called together the rest of the troops .
41015017	They put a purple robe on him , and on his head they placed a crown they had made out of thorn branches .
41015018	They made fun of Jesus and shouted , “ Hey , you king of the Jews ! ”
41015019	Then they beat him on the head with a stick . They spit on him and knelt down and pretended to worship him .
41015020	When the soldiers had finished making fun of Jesus , they took off the purple robe . They put his own clothes back on him and led him off to be nailed to a cross .
41015021	Simon from Cyrene happened to be coming in from a farm , and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross . Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus .
41015022	The soldiers took Jesus to Golgotha , which means “ Place of a Skull . ”
41015023	There they gave him some wine mixed with a drug to ease the pain , but he refused to drink it .
41015024	They nailed Jesus to a cross and gambled to see who would get his clothes .
41015025	It was about nine o'clock in the morning when they nailed him to the cross .
41015026	On it was a sign that told why he was nailed there . It read , “ This is the King of the Jews . ”
41015029	People who passed by said terrible things about Jesus . They shook their heads and shouted , “ Ha ! So you're the one who claimed you could tear down the temple and build it again in three days .
41015030	Save yourself and come down from the cross ! ”
41015031	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses also made fun of Jesus . They said to each other , “ He saved others , but he can't save himself .
41015032	If he is the Messiah , the king of Israel , let him come down from the cross ! Then we will see and believe . ” The two criminals also said cruel things to Jesus .
41015033	About noon the sky turned dark and stayed that way until around three o'clock .
41015034	Then about that time Jesus shouted , “ Eloi , Eloi , lema sabachthani ? ” which means , “ My God , my God , why have you deserted me ? ”
41015035	Some of the people standing there heard Jesus and said , “ He is calling for Elijah . ”
41015036	One of them ran and grabbed a sponge . After he had soaked it in wine , he put it on a stick and held it up to Jesus . He said , “ Let's wait and see if Elijah will come and take him down ! ”
41015037	Jesus shouted and then died .
41015038	At once the curtain in the temple tore in two from top to bottom .
41015039	A Roman army officer was standing in front of Jesus . When the officer saw how Jesus died , he said , “ This man really was the Son of God ! ”
41015042	It was now the evening before the Sabbath , and the Jewish people were getting ready for that sacred day .
41015043	A man named Joseph from Arimathea was brave enough to ask Pilate for the body of Jesus . Joseph was a highly respected member of the Jewish council , and he was also waiting for God's kingdom to come .
41015044	Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead , and he called in the army officer to find out if Jesus had been dead very long .
41015045	After the officer told him , Pilate let Joseph have Jesus' body .
41015046	Joseph bought a linen cloth and took the body down from the cross . He had it wrapped in the cloth , and he put it in a tomb that had been cut into solid rock . Then he rolled a big stone against the entrance to the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph were watching and saw where the body was placed .
41016001	After the Sabbath , Mary Magdalene , Salome , and Mary the mother of James bought some spices to put on Jesus' body .
41016002	Very early on Sunday morning , just as the sun was coming up , they went to the tomb .
41016003	On their way , they were asking one another , “ Who will roll the stone away from the entrance for us ? ”
41016004	But when they looked , they saw that the stone had already been rolled away . And it was a huge stone !
41016005	The women went into the tomb , and on the right side they saw a young man in a white robe sitting there . They were alarmed .
41016006	The man said , “ Don't be alarmed ! You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth , who was nailed to a cross . God has raised him to life , and he isn't here . You can see the place where they put his body .
41016007	Now go and tell his disciples , and especially Peter , that he will go ahead of you to Galilee . You will see him there , just as he told you . ”
41016008	When the women ran from the tomb , they were confused and shaking all over . They were too afraid to tell anyone what had happened .
41016009	Very early on the first day of the week , after Jesus had risen to life , he appeared to Mary Magdalene . Earlier he had forced seven demons out of her .
41016010	She left and told his friends , who were crying and mourning .
41016011	Even though they heard that Jesus was alive and that Mary had seen him , they still would not believe it .
41016012	Later , Jesus appeared in another form to two disciples , as they were on their way out of the city .
41016013	But when these disciples told what had happened , the others would not believe either .
41016014	Afterwards , Jesus appeared to his eleven disciples as they were eating . He scolded them because they were too stubborn to believe the ones who had seen him after he had been raised to life .
41016015	Then he told them :
41016019	After the Lord Jesus had said these things to the disciples , he was taken back up to heaven where he sat down at the right side of God .
41016020	Then the disciples left and preached everywhere . The Lord was with them , and the miracles they worked proved that their message was true .
42001001	Many people have tried to tell the story of what God has done among us .
42001002	They wrote what we had been told by the ones who were there in the beginning and saw what happened .
42001003	So I made a careful study of everything and then decided to write and tell you exactly what took place . Honorable Theophilus ,
42001004	I have done this to let you know the truth about what you have heard .
42001005	When Herod was king of Judea , there was a priest by the name of Zechariah from the priestly group of Abijah . His wife Elizabeth was from the family of Aaron .
42001006	Both of them were good people and pleased the Lord God by obeying all that he had commanded .
42001007	But they did not have children . Elizabeth could not have any , and both Zechariah and Elizabeth were already old .
42001008	One day Zechariah's group of priests were on duty , and he was serving God as a priest .
42001009	According to the custom of the priests , he had been chosen to go into the Lord's temple that day and to burn incense ,
42001010	while the people stood outside praying .
42001011	All at once an angel from the Lord appeared to Zechariah at the right side of the altar .
42001012	Zechariah was confused and afraid when he saw the angel .
42001013	But the angel told him :
42001018	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How will I know this is going to happen ? My wife and I are both very old . ”
42001019	The angel answered , “ I am Gabriel , God's servant , and I was sent to tell you this good news .
42001020	You have not believed what I have said . So you will not be able to say a thing until all this happens . But everything will take place when it is supposed to . ”
42001021	The crowd was waiting for Zechariah and kept wondering why he was staying in the temple so long .
42001022	When he did come out , he could not speak , and they knew he had seen a vision . He motioned to them with his hands , but did not say a thing .
42001023	When Zechariah's time of service in the temple was over , he went home .
42001024	Soon after this , his wife was expecting a baby , and for five months she did not leave the house . She said to herself ,
42001025	“ What the Lord has done for me will keep people from looking down on me . ”
42001026	One month later God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee
42001027	with a message for a virgin named Mary . She was engaged to Joseph from the family of King David .
42001028	The angel greeted Mary and said , “ You are truly blessed ! The Lord is with you . ”
42001029	Mary was confused by the angel's words and wondered what they meant .
42001030	Then the angel told Mary , “ Don't be afraid ! God is pleased with you ,
42001031	and you will have a son . His name will be Jesus .
42001032	He will be great and will be called the Son of God Most High . The Lord God will make him king , as his ancestor David was .
42001033	He will rule the people of Israel forever , and his kingdom will never end . ”
42001034	Mary asked the angel , “ How can this happen ? I am not even married ! ”
42001035	The angel answered , “ The Holy Spirit will come down to you , and God's power will come over you . So your child will be called the holy Son of God .
42001036	Your relative Elizabeth is also going to have a son , even though she is old . No one thought she could ever have a baby , but in three months she will have a son .
42001037	Nothing is impossible for God ! ”
42001038	Mary said , “ I am the Lord's servant ! Let it happen as you have said . ” And the angel left her .
42001039	A short time later Mary hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea .
42001040	She went into Zechariah's home , where she greeted Elizabeth .
42001041	When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting , her baby moved within her . The Holy Spirit came upon Elizabeth .
42001042	Then in a loud voice she said to Mary :
42001046	Mary said : With all my heart I praise the Lord ,
42001047	and I am glad because of God my Savior .
42001048	God cares for me , his humble servant . From now on , all people will say God has blessed me .
42001049	God All-Powerful has done great things for me , and his name is holy .
42001050	He always shows mercy to everyone who worships him .
42001051	The Lord has used his powerful arm to scatter those who are proud .
42001052	God drags strong rulers from their thrones and puts humble people in places of power .
42001053	God gives the hungry good things to eat , and sends the rich away with nothing .
42001054	God helps his servant Israel and is always merciful to his people .
42001055	The Lord made this promise to our ancestors , to Abraham and his family forever !
42001056	Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months . Then she went back home .
42001057	When Elizabeth's son was born ,
42001058	her neighbors and relatives heard how kind the Lord had been to her , and they too were glad .
42001059	Eight days later they did for the child what the Law of Moses commands . They were going to name him Zechariah , after his father .
42001060	But Elizabeth said , “ No ! His name is John . ”
42001061	The people argued , “ No one in your family has ever been named John . ”
42001062	So they motioned to Zechariah to find out what he wanted to name his son .
42001063	Zechariah asked for a writing tablet . Then he wrote , “ His name is John . ” Everyone was amazed .
42001064	At once , Zechariah started speaking and praising God .
42001065	All the neighbors were frightened because of what had happened , and everywhere in the hill country people kept talking about these things .
42001066	Everyone who heard about this wondered what this child would grow up to be . They knew the Lord was with him .
42001067	The Holy Spirit came upon Zechariah , and he began to speak :
42001068	Praise the Lord , the God of Israel ! He has come to save his people .
42001069	Our God has given us a mighty Savior from the family of David his servant .
42001070	Long ago the Lord promised by the words of his holy prophets
42001071	to save us from our enemies and from everyone who hates us .
42001072	God said he would be kind to our people and keep his sacred promise .
42001073	He told our ancestor Abraham
42001074	that he would rescue us from our enemies . Then we could serve him without fear ,
42001075	by being holy and good as long as we live .
42001076	You , my son , will be called the prophet of God Most High . You will go ahead of the Lord to get everything ready for him .
42001077	You will tell his people that they can be saved when their sins are forgiven .
42001078	God's love and kindness will shine upon us like the sun that rises in the sky .
42001079	On us who live in the dark shadow of death this light will shine to guide us into a life of peace .
42001080	As John grew up , God's Spirit gave him great power . John lived in the desert until the time he was sent to the people of Israel .
42002001	About that time Emperor Augustus gave orders for the names of all the people to be listed in record books .
42002002	These first records were made when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
42002003	Everyone had to go to their own hometown to be listed .
42002004	So Joseph had to leave Nazareth in Galilee and go to Bethlehem in Judea . Long ago Bethlehem had been King David's hometown , and Joseph went there because he was from David's family .
42002005	Mary was engaged to Joseph and traveled with him to Bethlehem . She was soon going to have a baby ,
42002006	and while they were there ,
42002007	she gave birth to her first-born son . She dressed him in baby clothes and laid him on a bed of hay , because there was no room for them in the inn .
42002008	That night in the fields near Bethlehem some shepherds were guarding their sheep .
42002009	All at once an angel came down to them from the Lord , and the brightness of the Lord's glory flashed around them . The shepherds were frightened .
42002010	But the angel said , “ Don't be afraid ! I have good news for you , which will make everyone happy .
42002011	This very day in King David's hometown a Savior was born for you . He is Christ the Lord .
42002012	You will know who he is , because you will find him dressed in baby clothes and lying on a bed of hay . ”
42002013	Suddenly many other angels came down from heaven and joined in praising God . They said :
42002014	“ Praise God in heaven ! Peace on earth to everyone who pleases God . ”
42002015	After the angels had left and gone back to heaven , the shepherds said to each other , “ Let's go to Bethlehem and see what the Lord has told us about . ”
42002016	They hurried off and found Mary and Joseph , and they saw the baby lying on a bed of hay .
42002017	When the shepherds saw Jesus , they told his parents what the angel had said about him .
42002018	Everyone listened and was surprised .
42002019	But Mary kept thinking about all this and wondering what it meant .
42002020	As the shepherds returned to their sheep , they were praising God and saying wonderful things about him . Everything they had seen and heard was just as the angel had said .
42002021	Eight days later Jesus' parents did for him what the Law of Moses commands . And they named him Jesus , just as the angel had told Mary when he promised she would have a baby .
42002022	The time came for Mary and Joseph to do what the Law of Moses says a mother is supposed to do after her baby is born . They took Jesus to the temple in Jerusalem and presented him to the Lord ,
42002023	just as the Law of the Lord says , “ Each first-born baby boy belongs to the Lord . ”
42002024	The Law of the Lord also says parents have to offer a sacrifice , giving at least a pair of doves or two young pigeons . So that is what Mary and Joseph did .
42002025	At this time a man named Simeon was living in Jerusalem . Simeon was a good man . He loved God and was waiting for him to save the people of Israel . God's Spirit came to him
42002026	and told him that he would not die until he had seen Christ the Lord .
42002027	When Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple to do what the Law of Moses says should be done for a new baby , the Spirit told Simeon to go into the temple .
42002028	Simeon took the baby Jesus in his arms and praised God ,
42002029	“ Lord , I am your servant , and now I can die in peace , because you have kept your promise to me .
42002030	With my own eyes I have seen what you have done to save your people ,
42002031	and foreign nations will also see this .
42002032	Your mighty power is a light for all nations , and it will bring honor to your people Israel . ”
42002033	Jesus' parents were surprised at what Simeon had said .
42002034	Then he blessed them and told Mary , “ This child of yours will cause many people in Israel to fall and others to stand . The child will be like a warning sign . Many people will reject him ,
42002035	and you , Mary , will suffer as though you had been stabbed by a dagger . But all this will show what people are really thinking . ”
42002036	The prophet Anna was also there in the temple . She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher , and she was very old . In her youth she had been married for seven years , but her husband died .
42002037	And now she was 84 years old . Night and day she served God in the temple by praying and often going without eating .
42002038	At this time Anna came in and praised God . She spoke about the child Jesus to everyone who hoped for Jerusalem to be set free .
42002039	After Joseph and Mary had done everything that the Law of the Lord commands , they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee .
42002040	The child Jesus grew . He became strong and wise , and God blessed him .
42002041	Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for Passover .
42002042	And when Jesus was twelve years old , they all went there as usual for the celebration .
42002043	After Passover his parents left , but they did not know that Jesus had stayed on in the city .
42002044	They thought he was traveling with some other people , and they went a whole day before they started looking for him .
42002045	When they could not find him with their relatives and friends , they went back to Jerusalem and started looking for him there .
42002046	Three days later they found Jesus sitting in the temple , listening to the teachers and asking them questions .
42002047	Everyone who heard him was surprised at how much he knew and at the answers he gave .
42002048	When his parents found him , they were amazed . His mother said , “ Son , why have you done this to us ? Your father and I have been very worried , and we have been searching for you ! ”
42002049	Jesus answered , “ Why did you have to look for me ? Didn't you know that I would be in my Father's house ? ”
42002050	But they did not understand what he meant .
42002051	Jesus went back to Nazareth with his parents and obeyed them . His mother kept on thinking about all that had happened .
42002052	Jesus became wise , and he grew strong . God was pleased with him and so were the people .
42003001	For 15 years Emperor Tiberius had ruled that part of the world . Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , and Herod was the ruler of Galilee . Herod's brother , Philip , was the ruler in the countries of Iturea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias was the ruler of Abilene .
42003002	Annas and Caiaphas were the Jewish high priests . At that time God spoke to Zechariah's son John , who was living in the desert .
42003003	So John went along the Jordan Valley , telling the people , “ Turn back to God and be baptized ! Then your sins will be forgiven . ”
42003004	Isaiah the prophet wrote about John when he said , “ In the desert someone is shouting , ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ! Make a straight path for him .
42003005	Fill up every valley and level every mountain and hill . Straighten the crooked paths and smooth out the rough roads .
42003006	Then everyone will see the saving power of God . ’ ”
42003007	Crowds of people came out to be baptized , but John said to them , “ You bunch of snakes ! Who warned you to run from the coming judgment ?
42003008	Do something to show that you really have given up your sins . Don't start saying you belong to Abraham's family . God can turn these stones into children for Abraham .
42003009	An ax is ready to cut the trees down at their roots . Any tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire . ”
42003010	The crowds asked John , “ What should we do ? ”
42003011	John told them , “ If you have two coats , give one to someone who doesn't have any . If you have food , share it with someone else . ”
42003012	When tax collectors came to be baptized , they asked John , “ Teacher , what should we do ? ”
42003013	John told them , “ Don't make people pay more than they owe . ”
42003014	Some soldiers asked him , “ And what about us ? What do we have to do ? ” John told them , “ Don't force people to pay money to make you leave them alone . Be satisfied with your pay . ”
42003015	Everyone became excited and wondered , “ Could John be the Messiah ? ”
42003016	John said , “ I am just baptizing with water . But someone more powerful is going to come , and I am not good enough even to untie his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
42003017	His threshing fork is in his hand , and he is ready to separate the wheat from the husks . He will store the wheat in his barn and burn the husks with a fire that never goes out . ”
42003018	In many different ways John preached the good news to the people .
42003019	But to Herod the ruler , he said , “ It was wrong for you to take Herodias , your brother's wife . ” John also said Herod had done many other bad things .
42003020	Finally , Herod put John in jail , and this was the worst thing he had done .
42003021	While everyone else was being baptized , Jesus himself was baptized . Then as he prayed , the sky opened up ,
42003022	and the Holy Spirit came down upon him in the form of a dove . A voice from heaven said , “ You are my own dear Son , and I am pleased with you . ”
42003023	When Jesus began to preach , he was about 30 years old . Everyone thought he was the son of Joseph . But his family went back through Heli ,
42003024	Matthat , Levi , Melchi , Jannai , Joseph ,
42003025	Mattathias , Amos , Nahum , Esli , Naggai ,
42003026	Maath , Mattathias , Semein , Josech , Joda ;
42003027	Joanan , Rhesa , Zerubbabel , Shealtiel , Neri ,
42003028	Melchi , Addi , Cosam , Elmadam , Er ,
42003029	Joshua , Eliezer , Jorim , Matthat , Levi ;
42003030	Simeon , Judah , Joseph , Jonam , Eliakim ,
42003031	Melea , Menna , Mattatha , Nathan , David ,
42003032	Jesse , Obed , Boaz , Salmon , Nahshon ;
42003033	Amminadab , Admin , Arni , Hezron , Perez , Judah ,
42003034	Jacob , Isaac , Abraham , Terah , Nahor ,
42003035	Serug , Reu , Peleg , Eber , Shelah ;
42003036	Cainan , Arphaxad , Shem , Noah , Lamech ,
42003037	Methuselah , Enoch , Jared , Mahalaleel , Kenan ,
42003038	Enosh , and Seth . The family of Jesus went all the way back to Adam and then to God .
42004001	When Jesus returned from the Jordan River , the power of the Holy Spirit was with him , and the Spirit led him into the desert .
42004002	For 40 days Jesus was tested by the devil , and during that time he went without eating . When it was all over , he was hungry .
42004003	The devil said to Jesus , “ If you are God's Son , tell this stone to turn into bread . ”
42004004	Jesus answered , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ No one can live only on food . ’ ”
42004005	Then the devil led Jesus up to a high place and quickly showed him all the nations on earth .
42004006	The devil said , “ I will give all this power and glory to you . It has been given to me , and I can give it to anyone I want to .
42004007	Just worship me , and you can have it all . ”
42004008	Jesus answered , “ The Scriptures say : ‘ Worship the Lord your God and serve only him ! ’ ”
42004009	Finally , the devil took Jesus to Jerusalem and had him stand on top of the temple . The devil said , “ If you are God's Son , jump off .
42004012	Jesus answered , “ The Scriptures also say , ‘ Don't try to test the Lord your God ! ’ ”
42004013	After the devil had finished testing Jesus in every way possible , he left him for a while .
42004014	Jesus returned to Galilee with the power of the Spirit . News about him spread everywhere .
42004015	He taught in the Jewish synagogues , and everyone praised him .
42004016	Jesus went back to Nazareth , where he had been brought up , and as usual he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath . When he stood up to read from the Scriptures ,
42004017	he was given the book of Isaiah the prophet . He opened it and read ,
42004018	“ The Lord's Spirit has come to me , because he has chosen me to tell the good news to the poor . The Lord has sent me to announce freedom for prisoners , to give sight to the blind , to free everyone who suffers ,
42004019	and to say , ‘ This is the year the Lord has chosen . ’ ”
42004020	Jesus closed the book , then handed it back to the man in charge and sat down . Everyone in the synagogue looked straight at Jesus .
42004021	Then Jesus said to them , “ What you have just heard me read has come true today . ”
42004022	All the people started talking about Jesus and were amazed at the wonderful things he said . They kept on asking , “ Isn't he Joseph's son ? ”
42004023	Jesus answered :
42004028	When the people in the synagogue heard Jesus say this , they became so angry
42004029	that they got up and threw him out of town . They dragged him to the edge of the cliff on which the town was built , because they wanted to throw him down from there .
42004030	But Jesus slipped through the crowd and got away .
42004031	Jesus went to the town of Capernaum in Galilee and taught the people on the Sabbath .
42004032	His teaching amazed them because he spoke with power .
42004033	There in the synagogue was a man with an evil spirit . He yelled out ,
42004034	“ Hey , Jesus of Nazareth , what do you want with us ? Are you here to get rid of us ? I know who you are ! You are God's Holy One . ”
42004035	Jesus ordered the evil spirit to be quiet and come out . The demon threw the man to the ground in front of everyone and left without harming him .
42004036	They all were amazed and kept saying to each other , “ What kind of teaching is this ? He has power to order evil spirits out of people ! ”
42004037	News about Jesus spread all over that part of the country .
42004038	Jesus left the synagogue and went to Simon's home . When Jesus got there , he was told that Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever .
42004039	So Jesus went over to her and ordered the fever to go away . Right then she was able to get up and serve them a meal .
42004040	After the sun had set , people with all kinds of diseases were brought to Jesus . He put his hands on each one of them and healed them .
42004041	Demons went out of many people and shouted , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But Jesus ordered the demons not to speak because they knew he was the Messiah .
42004042	The next morning Jesus went out to a place where he could be alone , and crowds came looking for him . When they found him , they tried to stop him from leaving .
42004043	But Jesus said , “ People in other towns must hear the good news about God's kingdom . This is why I was sent . ”
42004044	So he kept on preaching in the synagogues in Judea .
42005001	Jesus was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret , teaching the people as they crowded around him to hear God's message .
42005002	Near the shore he saw two boats left there by some fishermen who had gone to wash their nets .
42005003	Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon and asked him to row it out a little way from the shore . Then Jesus sat down in the boat to teach the crowd .
42005004	When Jesus had finished speaking , he told Simon , “ Row the boat out into the deep water and let your nets down to catch some fish . ”
42005005	“ Master , ” Simon answered , “ we have worked hard all night long and have not caught a thing . But if you tell me to , I will let the nets down . ”
42005006	They did this and caught so many fish that their nets began ripping apart .
42005007	Then they signaled for their partners in the other boat to come and help them . The men came , and together they filled the two boats so full that they both began to sink .
42005008	When Simon Peter saw this happen , he knelt down in front of Jesus and said , “ Lord , don't come near me ! I am a sinner . ”
42005009	Peter and everyone with him were completely surprised at all the fish they had caught .
42005010	His partners James and John , the sons of Zebedee , were surprised too . Jesus told Simon , “ Don't be afraid ! From now on you will bring in people instead of fish . ”
42005011	The men pulled their boats up on the shore . Then they left everything and went with Jesus .
42005012	Jesus came to a town where there was a man who had leprosy . When the man saw Jesus , he knelt down to the ground in front of Jesus and begged , “ Lord , you have the power to make me well , if only you wanted to . ”
42005013	Jesus put his hand on him and said , “ I want to ! Now you are well . ” At once the man's leprosy disappeared .
42005014	Jesus told him , “ Don't tell anyone about this , but go and show yourself to the priest . Offer a gift to the priest , just as Moses commanded , and everyone will know that you have been healed . ”
42005015	News about Jesus kept spreading . Large crowds came to listen to him teach and to be healed of their diseases .
42005016	But Jesus would often go to some place where he could be alone and pray .
42005017	One day some Pharisees and experts in the Law of Moses sat listening to Jesus teach . They had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem . God had given Jesus the power to heal the sick ,
42005018	and some people came carrying a man on a mat because he could not walk . They tried to take him inside the house and put him in front of Jesus .
42005019	But because of the crowd , they could not get him to Jesus . So they went up on the roof , where they removed some tiles and let the mat down in the middle of the room .
42005020	When Jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the man , “ My friend , your sins are forgiven . ”
42005021	The Pharisees and the experts began arguing , “ Jesus must think he is God ! Only God can forgive sins . ”
42005022	Jesus knew what they were thinking , and he said , “ Why are you thinking this ?
42005023	Is it easier for me to tell this man that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and walk ?
42005024	But now you will see that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth . ” Jesus then said to the man , “ Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk home . ”
42005025	At once the man stood up in front of everyone . He picked up his mat and went home , giving thanks to God .
42005026	Everyone was amazed and praised God . What they saw surprised them , and they said , “ We have seen a great miracle today ! ”
42005027	Later , Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the place for paying taxes . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me . ”
42005028	Levi left everything and went with Jesus .
42005029	In his home Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus . Many tax collectors and other guests were also there .
42005030	The Pharisees and some of their teachers of the Law of Moses grumbled to Jesus' disciples , “ Why do you eat and drink with these tax collectors and other sinners ? ”
42005031	Jesus answered , “ Healthy people don't need a doctor , but sick people do .
42005032	I didn't come to invite good people to turn to God . I came to invite sinners . ”
42005033	Some people said to Jesus , “ John's followers often pray and go without eating , and so do the followers of the Pharisees . But your disciples never go without eating or drinking . ”
42005034	Jesus told them , “ The friends of a bridegroom don't go without eating while he is still with them .
42005035	But the time will come when he will be taken from them . Then they will go without eating . ”
42005036	Jesus then told them these sayings :
42006001	One Sabbath when Jesus and his disciples were walking through some wheat fields , the disciples picked some wheat . They rubbed the husks off with their hands and started eating the grain .
42006002	Some Pharisees said , “ Why are you picking grain on the Sabbath ? You're not supposed to do that ! ”
42006003	Jesus answered , “ You surely have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry .
42006004	He went into the house of God and took the sacred loaves of bread that only priests were supposed to eat . He not only ate some himself , but even gave some to his followers . ”
42006005	Jesus finished by saying , “ The Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath . ”
42006006	On another Sabbath Jesus was teaching in a synagogue , and a man with a paralyzed right hand was there .
42006007	Some Pharisees and teachers of the Law of Moses kept watching Jesus to see if he would heal the man . They did this because they wanted to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong .
42006008	Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he told the man to stand up where everyone could see him . And the man stood up .
42006009	Then Jesus asked , “ On the Sabbath should we do good deeds or evil deeds ? Should we save someone's life or destroy it ? ”
42006010	After he had looked around at everyone , he told the man , “ Stretch out your hand . ” He did , and his bad hand became completely well .
42006011	The teachers and the Pharisees were furious and started saying to one another , “ What can we do about Jesus ? ”
42006012	About that time Jesus went off to a mountain to pray , and he spent the whole night there .
42006013	The next morning he called his disciples together and chose twelve of them to be his apostles .
42006014	One was Simon , and Jesus named him Peter . Another was Andrew , Peter's brother . There were also James , John , Philip , Bartholomew ,
42006015	Matthew , Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus . The rest of the apostles were Simon , known as the Eager One ,
42006016	Jude , who was the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who later betrayed Jesus .
42006017	Jesus and his apostles went down from the mountain and came to some flat , level ground . Many other disciples were there to meet him . Large crowds of people from all over Judea , Jerusalem , and the coastal towns of Tyre and Sidon were there too .
42006018	These people had come to listen to Jesus and to be healed of their diseases . All who were troubled by evil spirits were also healed .
42006019	Everyone was trying to touch Jesus , because power was going out from him and healing them all .
42006020	Jesus looked at his disciples and said : God will bless you people who are poor . His kingdom belongs to you !
42006021	God will bless you hungry people . You will have plenty to eat ! God will bless you people who are now crying . You will laugh !
42006024	But you rich people are in for trouble . You have already had an easy life !
42006025	You well-fed people are in for trouble . You will go hungry ! You people who are laughing now are in for trouble . You are going to cry and weep !
42006027	This is what I say to all who will listen to me :
42006037	Jesus said :
42006039	Jesus also used some sayings as he spoke to the people . He said :
42007001	After Jesus had finished teaching the people , he went to Capernaum .
42007002	In this town an army officer's servant was sick and about to die . The officer liked his servant very much .
42007003	And when he heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish leaders to ask him to come and heal the servant .
42007004	The leaders went to Jesus and begged him to do something . They said , “ This man deserves your help !
42007005	He loves our nation and even built us a synagogue . ”
42007006	So Jesus went with them . When Jesus wasn't far from the house , the officer sent some friends to tell him , “ Lord , don't go to any trouble for me ! I am not good enough for you to come into my house .
42007007	And I am certainly not worthy to come to you . Just say the word , and my servant will get well .
42007008	I have officers who give orders to me , and I have soldiers who take orders from me . I can say to one of them , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes . I can say to another , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes . I can say to my servant , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he will do it . ”
42007009	When Jesus heard this , he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him , “ In all of Israel I've never found anyone with this much faith ! ”
42007010	The officer's friends returned and found the servant well .
42007011	Soon Jesus and his disciples were on their way to the town of Nain , and a big crowd was going along with them .
42007012	As they came near the gate of the town , they saw people carrying out the body of a widow's only son . Many people from the town were walking along with her .
42007013	When the Lord saw the woman , he felt sorry for her and said , “ Don't cry ! ”
42007014	Jesus went over and touched the stretcher on which the people were carrying the dead boy . They stopped , and Jesus said , “ Young man , get up ! ”
42007015	The boy sat up and began to speak . Jesus then gave him back to his mother .
42007016	Everyone was frightened and praised God . They said , “ A great prophet is here with us ! God has come to his people . ”
42007017	News about Jesus spread all over Judea and everywhere else in that part of the country .
42007020	When these messengers came to Jesus , they said , “ John the Baptist sent us to ask , ‘ Are you the one we should be looking for ? Or are we supposed to wait for someone else ? ’ ”
42007021	At that time Jesus was healing many people who were sick or in pain or were troubled by evil spirits , and he was giving sight to a lot of blind people .
42007022	Jesus said to the messengers sent by John , “ Go and tell John what you have seen and heard . Blind people are now able to see , and the lame can walk . People who have leprosy are being healed , and the deaf can now hear . The dead are raised to life , and the poor are hearing the good news .
42007023	God will bless everyone who doesn't reject me because of what I do . ”
42007024	After John's messengers had gone , Jesus began speaking to the crowds about John :
42007029	Everyone had been listening to John . Even the tax collectors had obeyed God and had done what was right by letting John baptize them .
42007030	But the Pharisees and the experts in the Law of Moses refused to obey God and be baptized by John .
42007031	Jesus went on to say : “ We played the flute , but you would not dance ! We sang a funeral song , but you would not cry ! ”
42007036	A Pharisee invited Jesus to have dinner with him . So Jesus went to the Pharisee's home and got ready to eat .
42007037	When a sinful woman in that town found out that Jesus was there , she bought an expensive bottle of perfume .
42007038	Then she came and stood behind Jesus . She cried and started washing his feet with her tears and drying them with her hair . The woman kissed his feet and poured the perfume on them .
42007039	The Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and said to himself , “ If this man really were a prophet , he would know what kind of woman is touching him ! He would know that she is a sinner . ”
42007040	Jesus said to the Pharisee , “ Simon , I have something to say to you . ” “ Teacher , what is it ? ” Simon replied .
42007041	Jesus told him , “ Two people were in debt to a moneylender . One of them owed him 500 silver coins , and the other owed him 50 .
42007042	Since neither of them could pay him back , the moneylender said that they didn't have to pay him anything . Which one of them will like him more ? ”
42007043	Simon answered , “ I suppose it would be the one who had owed more and didn't have to pay it back . ” “ You are right , ” Jesus said .
42007044	He turned toward the woman and said to Simon , “ Have you noticed this woman ? When I came into your home , you didn't give me any water so I could wash my feet . But she has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair .
42007045	You didn't greet me with a kiss , but from the time I came in , she has not stopped kissing my feet .
42007046	You didn't even pour olive oil on my head , but she has poured expensive perfume on my feet .
42007047	So I tell you that all her sins are forgiven , and that is why she has shown great love . But anyone who has been forgiven for only a little will show only a little love . ”
42007048	Then Jesus said to the woman , “ Your sins are forgiven . ”
42007049	Some other guests started saying to one another , “ Who is this who dares to forgive sins ? ”
42007050	But Jesus told the woman , “ Because of your faith , you are now saved . May God give you peace ! ”
42008001	Soon after this , Jesus was going through towns and villages , telling the good news about God's kingdom . His twelve apostles were with him ,
42008002	and so were some women who had been healed of evil spirits and all sorts of diseases . One of the women was Mary Magdalene , who once had seven demons in her .
42008003	Joanna , Susanna , and many others had also used what they owned to help Jesus and his disciples . Joanna's husband Chuza was one of Herod's officials .
42008004	When a large crowd from several towns had gathered around Jesus , he told them this story : When Jesus had finished speaking , he said , “ If you have ears , pay attention ! ”
42008009	Jesus' disciples asked him what the story meant .
42008010	So he answered :
42008019	Jesus' mother and brothers went to see him , but because of the crowd they could not get near him .
42008020	Someone told Jesus , “ Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to see you . ”
42008021	Jesus answered , “ My mother and my brothers are those people who hear and obey God's message . ”
42008022	One day , Jesus and his disciples got into a boat , and he said , “ Let's cross the lake . ” They started out ,
42008023	and while they were sailing across , he went to sleep . Suddenly a storm struck the lake , and the boat started sinking . They were in danger .
42008024	So they went to Jesus and woke him up , “ Master , Master ! We are about to drown ! ” Jesus got up and ordered the wind and waves to stop . They obeyed , and everything was calm .
42008025	Then Jesus asked the disciples , “ Don't you have any faith ? ” But they were frightened and amazed . They said to each other , “ Who is this ? He can give orders to the wind and the waves , and they obey him ! ”
42008026	Jesus and his disciples sailed across Lake Galilee and came to shore near the town of Gerasa .
42008027	As Jesus was getting out of the boat , he was met by a man from this town . The man had demons in him . He had gone naked for a long time and no longer lived in a house , but in the graveyard .
42008028	The man saw Jesus and screamed . He knelt down in front of him and shouted , “ Jesus , Son of God Most High , what do you want with me ? I beg you not to torture me ! ”
42008029	He said this because Jesus had already told the evil spirit to go out of him . The man had often been attacked by the demon . And even though he had been bound with chains and leg irons and kept under guard , he smashed whatever bound him . Then the demon would force him out into lonely places .
42008030	Jesus asked the man , “ What is your name ? ” He answered , “ My name is Lots . ” He said this because there were “ lots ” of demons in him .
42008031	They begged Jesus not to send them to the deep pit , where they would be punished .
42008032	A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside . So the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs , and Jesus let them go .
42008033	Then the demons left the man and went into the pigs . The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned .
42008034	When the men taking care of the pigs saw this , they ran to spread the news in the town and on the farms .
42008035	The people went out to see what had happened , and when they came to Jesus , they also found the man . The demons had gone out of him , and he was sitting there at the feet of Jesus . He had clothes on and was in his right mind . But the people were terrified .
42008036	Then all who had seen the man healed told about it .
42008037	Everyone from around Gerasa begged Jesus to leave , because they were so frightened . When Jesus got into the boat to start back ,
42008038	the man who had been healed begged to go with him . But Jesus sent him off and said ,
42008039	“ Go back home and tell everyone how much God has done for you . ” The man then went all over town , telling everything that Jesus had done for him .
42008040	Everyone had been waiting for Jesus , and when he came back , a crowd was there to welcome him .
42008041	Just then the man in charge of the synagogue came and knelt down in front of Jesus . His name was Jairus , and he begged Jesus to come to his home
42008042	because his twelve-year-old child was dying . She was his only daughter . While Jesus was on his way , people were crowding all around him .
42008043	In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years . She had spent everything she had on doctors , but none of them could make her well .
42008044	As soon as she came up behind Jesus and barely touched his clothes , her bleeding stopped .
42008045	“ Who touched me ? ” Jesus asked . While everyone was denying it , Peter said , “ Master , people are crowding all around and pushing you from every side . ”
42008046	But Jesus answered , “ Someone touched me , because I felt power going out from me . ”
42008047	The woman knew that she could not hide , so she came trembling and knelt down in front of Jesus . She told everyone why she had touched him and that she had been healed at once .
42008048	Jesus said to the woman , “ You are now well because of your faith . May God give you peace ! ”
42008049	While Jesus was speaking , someone came from Jairus' home and said , “ Your daughter has died ! Why bother the teacher anymore ? ”
42008050	When Jesus heard this , he told Jairus , “ Don't worry ! Have faith , and your daughter will get well . ”
42008051	Jesus went into the house , but he did not let anyone else go with him , except Peter , John , James , and the girl's father and mother .
42008052	Everyone was crying and weeping for the girl . But Jesus said , “ The child isn't dead . She is just asleep . ”
42008053	The people laughed at him because they knew she was dead .
42008054	Jesus took hold of the girl's hand and said , “ Child , get up ! ”
42008055	She came back to life and got right up . Jesus told them to give her something to eat .
42008056	Her parents were surprised , but Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened .
42009001	Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them complete power over all demons and diseases .
42009002	Then he sent them to tell about God's kingdom and to heal the sick .
42009003	He told them , “ Don't take anything with you ! Don't take a walking stick or a traveling bag or food or money or even a change of clothes .
42009004	When you are welcomed into a home , stay there until you leave that town .
42009005	If people won't welcome you , leave the town and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them . ”
42009006	The apostles left and went from village to village , telling the good news and healing people everywhere .
42009007	Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening , and he was worried . Some people were saying John the Baptist had come back to life .
42009008	Others were saying Elijah had come or one of the prophets from long ago had come back to life .
42009009	But Herod said , “ I had John's head cut off ! Who is this I hear so much about ? ” Herod was eager to meet Jesus .
42009010	The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done . He then took them with him to the village of Bethsaida , where they could be alone .
42009011	But a lot of people found out about this and followed him . Jesus welcomed them . He spoke about God's kingdom and healed everyone who was sick .
42009012	Late in the afternoon the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said , “ Send the crowd to the villages and farms around here . They need to find a place to stay and something to eat . There is nothing in this place . It's like a desert ! ”
42009013	Jesus answered , “ You give them something to eat . ” But they replied , “ We have only five small loaves of bread and two fish . If we are going to feed all these people , we will have to go and buy food . ”
42009014	There were about 5,000 men in the crowd . Jesus said to his disciples , “ Tell the people to sit in groups of 50 . ”
42009015	They did this , and all the people sat down .
42009016	Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish . He looked up toward heaven and blessed the food . Then he broke the bread and fish and handed them to his disciples to give to the people .
42009017	Everyone ate all they wanted . What was left over filled twelve baskets .
42009018	When Jesus was alone praying , his disciples came to him , and he asked them , “ What do people say about me ? ”
42009019	They answered , “ Some say you are John the Baptist or Elijah or a prophet from long ago who has come back to life . ”
42009020	Jesus then asked , “ But who do you say I am ? ” Peter answered , “ You are the Messiah sent from God . ”
42009021	Jesus strictly warned his disciples not to tell anyone about this .
42009022	Jesus told his disciples , “ The nation's leaders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make the Son of Man suffer terribly . They will reject him and kill him , but three days later he will rise to life . ”
42009023	Then Jesus said to all the people :
42009028	About eight days later Jesus took Peter , John , and James with him and went up on a mountain to pray .
42009029	While he was praying , his face changed , and his clothes became shining white .
42009030	Suddenly Moses and Elijah were there speaking with him .
42009031	They appeared in heavenly glory and talked about all that Jesus' death in Jerusalem would mean .
42009032	Peter and the other two disciples had been sound asleep . All at once they woke up and saw how glorious Jesus was . They also saw the two men who were with him .
42009033	Moses and Elijah were about to leave , when Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good for us to be here ! Let us make three shelters , one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ” But Peter did not know what he was talking about .
42009034	While Peter was still speaking , a shadow from a cloud passed over , and they were frightened as the cloud covered them .
42009035	From the cloud a voice spoke , “ This is my chosen Son . Listen to what he says ! ”
42009036	After the voice had spoken , Peter , John , and James saw only Jesus . For some time they kept quiet and did not say anything about what they had seen .
42009037	The next day Jesus and his three disciples came down from the mountain and were met by a large crowd .
42009038	Just then someone in the crowd shouted , “ Teacher , please do something for my son ! He is my only child !
42009039	A demon often attacks him and makes him scream . It shakes him until he foams at the mouth , and it won't leave him until it has completely worn the boy out .
42009040	I begged your disciples to force out the demon , but they couldn't do it . ”
42009041	Jesus said to them , “ You people are stubborn and don't have any faith ! How much longer must I be with you ? Why do I have to put up with you ? ” Then Jesus said to the man , “ Bring your son to me . ”
42009042	While the boy was being brought , the demon attacked him and made him shake all over . Jesus ordered the demon to stop . Then he healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
42009043	Everyone was amazed at God's great power . While everyone was still amazed at what Jesus was doing , he said to his disciples ,
42009044	“ Pay close attention to what I am telling you ! The Son of Man will be handed over to his enemies . ”
42009045	But the disciples did not know what he meant . The meaning was hidden from them . They could not understand it , and they were afraid to ask .
42009046	Jesus' disciples were arguing about which one of them was the greatest .
42009047	Jesus knew what they were thinking , and he had a child stand there beside him .
42009048	Then he said to his disciples , “ When you welcome even a child because of me , you welcome me . And when you welcome me , you welcome the one who sent me . Whichever one of you is the most humble is the greatest . ”
42009049	John said , “ Master , we saw a man using your name to force demons out of people . But we told him to stop , because he isn't one of us . ”
42009050	“ Don't stop him ! ” Jesus said . “ Anyone who isn't against you is for you . ”
42009051	Not long before it was time for Jesus to be taken up to heaven , he made up his mind to go to Jerusalem .
42009052	He sent some messengers on ahead to a Samaritan village to get things ready for him .
42009053	But he was on his way to Jerusalem , so the people there refused to welcome him .
42009054	When the disciples James and John saw what was happening , they asked , “ Lord , do you want us to call down fire from heaven to destroy these people ? ”
42009055	But Jesus turned and corrected them for what they had said .
42009056	Then they all went on to another village .
42009057	Along the way someone said to Jesus , “ I'll follow you anywhere ! ”
42009058	Jesus said , “ Foxes have dens , and birds have nests , but the Son of Man doesn't have a place to call his own . ”
42009059	Jesus told someone else to come with him . But the man said , “ Lord , let me wait until I bury my father . ”
42009060	Jesus answered , “ Let the dead take care of the dead , while you go and tell about God's kingdom . ”
42009061	Then someone said to Jesus , “ I want to follow you , Lord , but first let me go back and take care of things at home . ”
42009062	Jesus answered , “ Anyone who starts plowing and keeps looking back isn't worth a thing to God's kingdom ! ”
42010001	Later the Lord chose 72 other followers and sent them out two by two to every town and village where he was about to go .
42010002	He said to them :
42010017	When the 72 followers returned , they were excited and said , “ Lord , even the demons obeyed when we spoke in your name ! ”
42010018	Jesus told them :
42010021	At that same time , Jesus felt the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit , and he said :
42010023	Jesus then turned to his disciples and said to them in private , “ You are really blessed to see what you see !
42010024	Many prophets and kings were eager to see what you see and to hear what you hear . But I tell you they did not see or hear . ”
42010025	An expert in the Law of Moses stood up and asked Jesus a question to see what he would say . “ Teacher , ” he asked , “ what must I do to have eternal life ? ”
42010026	Jesus answered , “ What is written in the Scriptures ? How do you understand them ? ”
42010027	The man replied , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , soul , strength , and mind . ’ They also say , ‘ Love your neighbors as much as you love yourself . ’ ”
42010028	Jesus said , “ You have given the right answer . If you do this , you will have eternal life . ”
42010029	But the man wanted to show that he knew what he was talking about . So he asked Jesus , “ Who are my neighbors ? ”
42010030	Jesus replied :
42010036	Then Jesus asked , “ Which one of these three people was a real neighbor to the man who was beaten up by robbers ? ”
42010037	The expert in the Law of Moses answered , “ The one who showed pity . ” Jesus said , “ Go and do the same ! ”
42010038	The Lord and his disciples were traveling along and came to a village . When they got there , a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home .
42010039	She had a sister named Mary , who sat down in front of the Lord and was listening to what he said .
42010040	Martha was worried about all that had to be done . Finally , she went to Jesus and said , “ Lord , doesn't it bother you that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself ? Tell her to come and help me ! ”
42010041	The Lord answered , “ Martha , Martha ! You are worried and upset about so many things ,
42010042	but only one thing is necessary . Mary has chosen what is best , and it will not be taken away from her . ”
42011001	When Jesus had finished praying , one of his disciples said to him , “ Lord , teach us to pray , just as John taught his followers to pray . ”
42011002	So Jesus told them , “ Pray in this way : ‘ Father , help us to honor your name . Come and set up your kingdom .
42011003	Give us each day the food we need .
42011004	Forgive our sins , as we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us . And keep us from being tempted . ’ ”
42011005	Then Jesus went on to say :
42011014	Jesus forced a demon out of a man who could not talk . And after the demon had gone out , the man started speaking , and the crowds were amazed .
42011015	But some people said , “ He forces out demons by the power of Beelzebul , the ruler of the demons ! ”
42011016	Others wanted to put Jesus to the test . So they asked him to show them a sign from God .
42011017	Jesus knew what they were thinking , and he said :
42011027	While Jesus was still talking , a woman in the crowd spoke up , “ The woman who gave birth to you and nursed you is blessed ! ”
42011028	Jesus replied , “ That's true , but the people who are really blessed are the ones who hear and obey God's message ! ”
42011029	As crowds were gathering around Jesus , he said :
42011037	When Jesus finished speaking , a Pharisee invited him home for a meal . Jesus went and sat down to eat .
42011038	The Pharisee was surprised that he did not wash his hands before eating .
42011039	So the Lord said to him :
42011045	A teacher of the Law of Moses spoke up , “ Teacher , you said cruel things about us . ”
42011046	Jesus replied :
42011053	Jesus was about to leave , but the teachers and the Pharisees wanted to get even with him . They tried to make him say what he thought about other things ,
42011054	so they could catch him saying something wrong .
42012001	As thousands of people crowded around Jesus and were stepping on each other , he told his disciples :
42012013	A man in a crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , tell my brother to give me my share of what our father left us when he died . ”
42012014	Jesus answered , “ Who gave me the right to settle arguments between you and your brother ? ”
42012015	Then he said to the crowd , “ Don't be greedy ! Owning a lot of things won't make your life safe . ”
42012016	So Jesus told them this story :
42012021	“ This is what happens to people who store up everything for themselves , but are poor in the sight of God . ”
42012022	Jesus said to his disciples :
42012041	Peter asked Jesus , “ Did you say this just for us or for everyone ? ”
42012042	The Lord answered :
42012054	Jesus said to all the people :
42013001	About this same time Jesus was told that Pilate had given orders for some people from Galilee to be killed while they were offering sacrifices .
42013002	Jesus replied :
42013006	Jesus then told them this story :
42013010	One Sabbath , Jesus was teaching in a synagogue ,
42013011	and a woman was there who had been crippled by an evil spirit for 18 years . She was completely bent over and could not straighten up .
42013012	When Jesus saw the woman , he called her over and said , “ You are now well . ”
42013013	He placed his hands on her , and at once she stood up straight and praised God .
42013014	The man in charge of the synagogue was angry because Jesus had healed someone on the Sabbath . So he said to the people , “ Each week has six days when we can work . Come and be healed on one of those days , but not on the Sabbath . ”
42013015	The Lord replied , “ Are you trying to fool someone ? Won't any one of you untie your ox or donkey and lead it out to drink on a Sabbath ?
42013016	This woman belongs to the family of Abraham , but Satan has kept her bound for 18 years . Isn't it right to set her free on the Sabbath ? ”
42013017	Jesus' words made his enemies ashamed . But everyone else in the crowd was happy about the wonderful things he was doing .
42013018	Jesus said , “ What is God's kingdom like ? What can I compare it with ?
42013019	It is like what happens when someone plants a mustard seed in a garden . The seed grows as big as a tree , and birds nest in its branches . ”
42013020	Then Jesus said , “ What can I compare God's kingdom with ?
42013021	It is like what happens when a woman mixes yeast into three batches of flour . Finally , all the dough rises . ”
42013022	As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem , he taught the people in the towns and villages .
42013023	Someone asked him , “ Lord , are only a few people going to be saved ? ” Jesus answered :
42013031	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said , “ You had better get away from here , because Herod wants to kill you ! ”
42013032	Jesus said to them : “ Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord . ”
42014001	One Sabbath , Jesus was having dinner in the home of an important Pharisee , and everyone was carefully watching Jesus .
42014002	All of a sudden a man with swollen legs stood up in front of him .
42014003	Jesus turned and asked the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses , “ Is it right to heal on the Sabbath ? ”
42014004	But they did not say a word . Jesus took hold of the man . Then he healed him and sent him away .
42014005	Afterwards , Jesus asked the people , “ If your son or ox falls into a well , wouldn't you pull him out at once , even on the Sabbath ? ”
42014006	There was nothing they could say .
42014007	Jesus saw how the guests had tried to take the best seats . So he told them :
42014012	Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him :
42014015	After Jesus had finished speaking , one of the guests said , “ The greatest blessing of all is to be at the banquet in God's kingdom ! ”
42014016	Jesus told him :
42014025	Large crowds were walking along with Jesus , when he turned and said :
42015001	Tax collectors and sinners were all crowding around to listen to Jesus .
42015002	So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses started grumbling , “ This man is friendly with sinners . He even eats with them . ”
42015003	Then Jesus told them this story :
42015007	Jesus said , “ In the same way there is more happiness in heaven because of one sinner who turns to God than over 99 good people who don't need to . ”
42015008	Jesus told the people another story :
42015010	Jesus said , “ In the same way God's angels are happy when even one person turns to him . ”
42015011	Jesus told them yet another story :
42016001	Jesus said to his disciples :
42016014	The Pharisees really loved money . So when they heard what Jesus said , they made fun of him .
42016015	But Jesus told them :
42017001	Jesus said to his disciples :
42017005	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Make our faith stronger ! ”
42017006	Jesus replied :
42017011	On his way to Jerusalem , Jesus went along the border between Samaria and Galilee .
42017012	As he was going into a village , ten men with leprosy came toward him . They stood at a distance
42017013	and shouted , “ Jesus , Master , have pity on us ! ”
42017014	Jesus looked at them and said , “ Go show yourselves to the priests . ” On their way they were healed .
42017015	When one of them discovered that he was healed , he came back , shouting praises to God .
42017016	He bowed down at the feet of Jesus and thanked him . The man was from the country of Samaria .
42017017	Jesus asked , “ Weren't ten men healed ? Where are the other nine ?
42017018	Why was this foreigner the only one who came back to thank God ? ”
42017019	Then Jesus told the man , “ You may get up and go . Your faith has made you well . ”
42017020	Some Pharisees asked Jesus when God's kingdom would come . He answered , “ God's kingdom isn't something you can see .
42017021	There is no use saying , ‘ Look ! Here it is ’ or ‘ Look ! There it is . ’ God's kingdom is here with you . ”
42017022	Jesus said to his disciples :
42017037	Then Jesus' disciples spoke up , “ But where will this happen , Lord ? ” Jesus said , “ Where there is a corpse , there will always be vultures . ”
42018001	Jesus told his disciples a story about how they should keep on praying and never give up :
42018006	The Lord said :
42018009	Jesus told a story to some people who thought they were better than others and who looked down on everyone else :
42018014	Then Jesus said , “ When the two men went home , it was the tax collector and not the Pharisee who was pleasing to God . If you put yourself above others , you will be put down . But if you humble yourself , you will be honored . ”
42018015	Some people brought their little children for Jesus to bless . But when his disciples saw them doing this , they told the people to stop bothering him .
42018016	So Jesus called the children over to him and said , “ Let the children come to me ! Don't try to stop them . People who are like these children belong to God's kingdom .
42018017	You will never get into God's kingdom unless you enter it like a child ! ”
42018018	An important man asked Jesus , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to have eternal life ? ”
42018019	Jesus said , “ Why do you call me good ? Only God is good .
42018020	You know the commandments : ‘ Be faithful in marriage . Do not murder . Do not steal . Do not tell lies about others . Respect your father and mother . ’ ”
42018021	He told Jesus , “ I have obeyed all these commandments since I was a young man . ”
42018022	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ There is one thing you still need to do . Go and sell everything you own ! Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven . Then come and be my follower . ”
42018023	When the man heard this , he was sad , because he was very rich .
42018024	Jesus saw how sad the man was . So he said , “ It's terribly hard for rich people to get into God's kingdom !
42018025	In fact , it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into God's kingdom . ”
42018026	When the crowd heard this , they asked , “ How can anyone ever be saved ? ”
42018027	Jesus replied , “ There are some things that people cannot do , but God can do anything . ”
42018028	Peter said , “ Remember , we left everything to be your followers ! ”
42018029	Jesus answered , “ You can be sure that anyone who gives up home or wife or brothers or family or children because of God's kingdom
42018030	will be given much more in this life . And in the future world they will have eternal life . ”
42018031	Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said :
42018034	The apostles did not understand what Jesus was talking about . They could not understand , because the meaning of what he said was hidden from them .
42018035	When Jesus was coming close to Jericho , a blind man sat begging beside the road .
42018036	The man heard the crowd walking by and asked what was happening .
42018037	Some people told him that Jesus from Nazareth was passing by .
42018038	So the blind man shouted , “ Jesus , Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
42018039	The people who were going along with Jesus told the man to be quiet . But he shouted even louder , “ Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
42018040	Jesus stopped and told some people to bring the blind man over to him . When the blind man was getting near , Jesus asked ,
42018041	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” “ Lord , I want to see ! ” he answered .
42018042	Jesus replied , “ Look and you will see ! Your eyes are healed because of your faith . ”
42018043	At once the man could see , and he went with Jesus and started thanking God . When the crowds saw what happened , they praised God .
42019001	Jesus was going through Jericho ,
42019002	where a man named Zacchaeus lived . He was in charge of collecting taxes and was very rich .
42019005	When Jesus got there , he looked up and said , “ Zacchaeus , hurry down ! I want to stay with you today . ”
42019006	Zacchaeus hurried down and gladly welcomed Jesus .
42019007	Everyone who saw this started grumbling , “ This man Zacchaeus is a sinner ! And Jesus is going home to eat with him . ”
42019008	Later that day Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord , “ I will give half of my property to the poor . And I will now pay back four times as much to everyone I have ever cheated . ”
42019009	Jesus said to Zacchaeus , “ Today you and your family have been saved , because you are a true son of Abraham .
42019010	The Son of Man came to look for and to save people who are lost . ”
42019011	The crowd was still listening to Jesus as he was getting close to Jerusalem . Many of them thought that God's kingdom would soon appear ,
42019012	and Jesus told them this story :
42019028	When Jesus had finished saying all this , he went on toward Jerusalem .
42019029	As he was getting near Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples on ahead .
42019030	He told them , “ Go into the next village , where you will find a young donkey that has never been ridden . Untie the donkey and bring it here .
42019031	If anyone asks why you are doing this , just say , ‘ The Lord needs it . ’ ”
42019032	They went off and found everything just as Jesus had said .
42019033	While they were untying the donkey , its owners asked , “ Why are you doing that ? ”
42019034	They answered , “ The Lord needs it . ”
42019035	Then they led the donkey to Jesus . They put some of their clothes on its back and helped Jesus get on .
42019036	And as he rode along , the people spread clothes on the road in front of him .
42019037	When Jesus started down the Mount of Olives , his large crowd of disciples were happy and praised God because of all the miracles they had seen .
42019038	They shouted , “ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven and glory to God . ”
42019039	Some Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , make your disciples stop shouting ! ”
42019040	But Jesus answered , “ If they keep quiet , these stones will start shouting . ”
42019041	When Jesus came closer and could see Jerusalem , he cried
42019042	and said :
42019045	When Jesus entered the temple , he started chasing out the people who were selling things .
42019046	He told them , “ The Scriptures say , ‘ My house should be a place of worship . ’ But you have made it a place where robbers hide ! ”
42019047	Each day , Jesus kept on teaching in the temple . So the chief priests , the teachers of the Law of Moses , and some other important people tried to have him killed .
42019048	But they could not find a way to do it , because everyone else was eager to listen to him .
42020001	One day , Jesus was teaching in the temple and telling the good news . So the chief priests , the teachers , and the nation's leaders
42020002	asked him , “ What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
42020003	Jesus replied , “ I want to ask you a question .
42020004	Who gave John the right to baptize ? Was it God in heaven or merely some human being ? ”
42020005	They talked this over and said to each other , “ We can't say God gave John this right . Jesus will ask us why we didn't believe John .
42020006	And we can't say it was merely some human who gave John the right to baptize . The crowd will stone us to death , because they think John was a prophet . ”
42020007	So they told Jesus , “ We don't know who gave John the right to baptize . ”
42020008	Jesus replied , “ Then I won't tell you who gave me the right to do what I do . ”
42020009	Jesus told the people this story : Jesus asked , “ What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do ?
42020016	I'll tell you what . He will come and kill those renters and let someone else have his vineyard . ” When the people heard this , they said , “ This must never happen ! ”
42020017	But Jesus looked straight at them and said , “ Then what do the Scriptures mean when they say , ‘ The stone the builders tossed aside is now the most important stone of all ’ ?
42020018	Anyone who stumbles over this stone will get hurt , and anyone it falls on will be smashed to pieces . ”
42020019	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses knew that Jesus was talking about them when he was telling this story . They wanted to arrest him right then , but they were afraid of the people .
42020020	Jesus' enemies kept watching him closely , because they wanted to hand him over to the Roman governor . So they sent some men who pretended to be good . But they were really spies trying to catch Jesus saying something wrong .
42020021	The spies said to him , “ Teacher , we know you teach the truth about what God wants people to do . And you treat everyone with the same respect , no matter who they are .
42020022	Tell us , should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not ? ”
42020023	Jesus knew they were trying to trick him . So he told them ,
42020024	“ Show me a coin . ” Then he asked , “ Whose picture and name are on it ? ” “ The Emperor's , ” they answered .
42020025	Then he told them , “ Give the Emperor what belongs to him and give God what belongs to God . ”
42020026	Jesus' enemies could not catch him saying anything wrong there in front of the people . They were amazed at his answer and kept quiet .
42020027	The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death . So some of them came to Jesus
42020028	and said :
42020034	Jesus answered :
42020039	Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses said , “ Teacher , you have given a good answer ! ”
42020040	From then on , no one dared to ask Jesus any questions .
42020041	Jesus asked , “ Why do people say that the Messiah will be the son of King David ?
42020042	In the book of Psalms , David himself says , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right side
42020043	until I make your enemies into a footstool for you . ’
42020045	While everyone was listening to Jesus , he said to his disciples :
42021001	Jesus looked up and saw some rich people tossing their gifts into the offering box .
42021002	He also saw a poor widow putting in a few cents .
42021003	And he said , “ I tell you that this poor woman has put in more than all the others .
42021004	Everyone else gave what they didn't need . But she is very poor and gave everything she had . ”
42021005	Some people were talking about the beautiful stones used to build the temple and about the gifts that had been placed in it . Jesus said ,
42021006	“ Do you see these stones ? The time is coming when not one of them will be left in place . They will all be knocked down . ”
42021007	Some people asked , “ Teacher , when will all this happen ? How can we know when these things are about to take place ? ”
42021008	Jesus replied :
42021029	Then Jesus told them a story :
42021037	Jesus taught in the temple each day , and he spent each night on the Mount of Olives .
42021038	Everyone got up early and came to the temple to hear him teach .
42022001	The Festival of Thin Bread , also called Passover , was near .
42022002	The chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses were looking for a way to get rid of Jesus , because they were afraid of what the people might do .
42022003	Then Satan entered the heart of Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve apostles .
42022004	Judas went to talk with the chief priests and the officers of the temple police about how he could help them arrest Jesus .
42022005	They were very pleased and offered to pay Judas some money .
42022006	He agreed and started looking for a good chance to betray Jesus when the crowds were not around .
42022007	The day had come for the Festival of Thin Bread , and it was time to kill the Passover lambs .
42022008	So Jesus said to Peter and John , “ Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat . ”
42022009	But they asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
42022010	Jesus told them , “ As you go into the city , you will meet a man carrying a jar of water . Follow him into the house
42022011	and say to the owner , ‘ Our teacher wants to know where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples . ’
42022012	The owner will take you upstairs and show you a large room ready for you to use . Prepare the meal there . ”
42022013	Peter and John left . They found everything just as Jesus had told them , and they prepared the Passover meal .
42022014	When the time came for Jesus and the apostles to eat ,
42022015	he said to them , “ I have very much wanted to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer .
42022016	I tell you I will not eat another Passover meal until it is finally eaten in God's kingdom . ”
42022017	Jesus took a cup of wine in his hands and gave thanks to God . Then he told the apostles , “ Take this wine and share it with each other .
42022018	I tell you that I will not drink any more wine until God's kingdom comes . ”
42022019	Jesus took some bread in his hands and gave thanks for it . He broke the bread and handed it to his apostles . Then he said , “ This is my body , which is given for you . Eat this as a way of remembering me ! ”
42022020	After the meal he took another cup of wine in his hands . Then he said , “ This is my blood . It is poured out for you , and with it God makes his new agreement .
42022021	The one who will betray me is here at the table with me !
42022022	The Son of Man will die in the way that has been decided for him , but it will be terrible for the one who betrays him ! ”
42022023	Then the apostles started arguing about who would ever do such a thing .
42022024	The apostles got into an argument about which one of them was the greatest .
42022025	So Jesus told them :
42022031	Jesus said , “ Simon , listen to me ! Satan has demanded the right to test each one of you , as a farmer does when he separates wheat from the husks .
42022032	But Simon , I have prayed that your faith will be strong . And when you have come back to me , help the others . ”
42022033	Peter said , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you to jail and even to die with you . ”
42022034	Jesus replied , “ Peter , I tell you that before a rooster crows tomorrow morning , you will say three times that you don't know me . ”
42022035	Jesus asked his disciples , “ When I sent you out without a moneybag or a traveling bag or sandals , did you need anything ? ” “ No ! ” they answered .
42022036	Jesus told them , “ But now , if you have a moneybag , take it with you . Also take a traveling bag , and if you don't have a sword , sell some of your clothes and buy one .
42022037	Do this because the Scriptures say , ‘ He was considered a criminal . ’ This was written about me , and it will soon come true . ”
42022038	The disciples said , “ Lord , here are two swords ! ” “ Enough of that ! ” Jesus replied .
42022039	Jesus went out to the Mount of Olives , as he often did , and his disciples went with him .
42022040	When they got there , he told them , “ Pray that you won't be tested . ”
42022041	Jesus walked on a little way before he knelt down and prayed ,
42022042	“ Father , if you will , please don't make me suffer by drinking from this cup . But do what you want , and not what I want . ”
42022043	Then an angel from heaven came to help him .
42022044	Jesus was in great pain and prayed so sincerely that his sweat fell to the ground like drops of blood .
42022045	Jesus got up from praying and went over to his disciples . They were asleep and worn out from being so sad .
42022046	He said to them , “ Why are you asleep ? Wake up and pray that you won't be tested . ”
42022047	While Jesus was still speaking , a crowd came up . It was led by Judas , one of the twelve apostles . He went over to Jesus and greeted him with a kiss .
42022048	Jesus asked Judas , “ Are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
42022049	When Jesus' disciples saw what was about to happen , they asked , “ Lord , should we attack them with a sword ? ”
42022050	One of the disciples even struck at the high priest's servant with his sword and cut off the servant's right ear .
42022051	“ Enough of that ! ” Jesus said . Then he touched the servant's ear and healed it .
42022052	Jesus spoke to the chief priests , the temple police , and the leaders who had come to arrest him . He said , “ Why do you come out with swords and clubs and treat me like a criminal ?
42022053	I was with you every day in the temple , and you didn't arrest me . But this is your time , and darkness is in control . ”
42022054	Jesus was arrested and led away to the house of the high priest , while Peter followed at a distance .
42022055	Some people built a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting around it . Peter sat there with them ,
42022056	and a servant girl saw him . Then after she had looked at him carefully , she said , “ This man was with Jesus ! ”
42022057	Peter said , “ Woman , I don't even know that man ! ”
42022058	A little later someone else saw Peter and said , “ You are one of them ! ” “ No , I'm not ! ” Peter replied .
42022059	About an hour later another man insisted , “ This man must have been with Jesus . They both come from Galilee . ”
42022060	Peter replied , “ I don't know what you are talking about ! ” Right then , while Peter was still speaking , a rooster crowed .
42022061	The Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter remembered that the Lord had said , “ Before a rooster crows tomorrow morning , you will say three times that you don't know me . ”
42022062	Then Peter went out and cried bitterly .
42022063	The men who were guarding Jesus made fun of him and beat him .
42022064	They put a blindfold on him and said , “ Tell us who struck you ! ”
42022065	They kept on insulting Jesus in many other ways .
42022066	At daybreak the nation's leaders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law of Moses got together and brought Jesus before their council .
42022067	They said , “ Tell us ! Are you the Messiah ? ” Jesus replied , “ If I said so , you wouldn't believe me .
42022068	And if I asked you a question , you wouldn't answer .
42022069	But from now on , the Son of Man will be seated at the right side of God All-Powerful . ”
42022070	Then they asked , “ Are you the Son of God ? ” Jesus answered , “ You say I am ! ”
42022071	They replied , “ Why do we need more witnesses ? He said it himself ! ”
42023001	Everyone in the council got up and led Jesus off to Pilate .
42023002	They started accusing him and said , “ We caught this man trying to get our people to riot and to stop paying taxes to the Emperor . He also claims that he is the Messiah , our king . ”
42023003	Pilate asked Jesus , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” “ Those are your words , ” Jesus answered .
42023004	Pilate told the chief priests and the crowd , “ I don't find him guilty of anything . ”
42023005	But they all kept on saying , “ He has been teaching and causing trouble all over Judea . He started in Galilee and has now come all the way here . ”
42023006	When Pilate heard this , he asked , “ Is this man from Galilee ? ”
42023007	After Pilate learned that Jesus came from the region ruled by Herod , he sent him to Herod , who was in Jerusalem at that time .
42023008	For a long time Herod had wanted to see Jesus and was very happy because he finally had this chance . He had heard many things about Jesus and hoped to see him work a miracle .
42023009	Herod asked him a lot of questions , but Jesus did not answer .
42023010	Then the chief priests and the teachers of the Law of Moses stood up and accused him of all kinds of bad things .
42023011	Herod and his soldiers made fun of Jesus and insulted him . They put a fine robe on him and sent him back to Pilate .
42023012	That same day Herod and Pilate became friends , even though they had been enemies before this .
42023013	Pilate called together the chief priests , the leaders , and the people .
42023014	He told them , “ You brought Jesus to me and said he was a troublemaker . But I have questioned him here in front of you , and I have not found him guilty of anything that you say he has done .
42023015	Herod didn't find him guilty either and sent him back . This man doesn't deserve to be put to death !
42023018	But the whole crowd shouted , “ Kill Jesus ! Give us Barabbas ! ”
42023019	Now Barabbas was in jail because he had started a riot in the city and had murdered someone .
42023020	Pilate wanted to set Jesus free , so he spoke again to the crowds .
42023021	But they kept shouting , “ Nail him to a cross ! Nail him to a cross ! ”
42023022	Pilate spoke to them a third time , “ But what crime has he done ? I have not found him guilty of anything for which he should be put to death . I will have him beaten with a whip and set free . ”
42023023	The people kept on shouting as loud as they could for Jesus to be put to death .
42023024	Finally , Pilate gave in .
42023025	He freed the man who was in jail for rioting and murder , because he was the one the crowd wanted to be set free . Then Pilate handed Jesus over for them to do what they wanted with him .
42023026	As Jesus was being led away , some soldiers grabbed hold of a man named Simon who was from Cyrene . He was coming in from the fields , but they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus .
42023027	A large crowd was following Jesus , and in the crowd a lot of women were crying and weeping for him .
42023028	Jesus turned to the women and said :
42023032	Two criminals were led out to be put to death with Jesus .
42023033	When the soldiers came to the place called “ The Skull , ” they nailed Jesus to a cross . They also nailed the two criminals to crosses , one on each side of Jesus .
42023036	The soldiers made fun of Jesus and brought him some wine .
42023037	They said , “ If you are the king of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
42023038	Above him was a sign that said , “ This is the King of the Jews . ”
42023039	One of the criminals hanging there also insulted Jesus by saying , “ Aren't you the Messiah ? Save yourself and save us ! ”
42023040	But the other criminal told the first one off , “ Don't you fear God ? Aren't you getting the same punishment as this man ?
42023041	We got what was coming to us , but he didn't do anything wrong . ”
42023042	Then he said to Jesus , “ Remember me when you come into power ! ”
42023043	Jesus replied , “ I promise that today you will be with me in paradise . ”
42023044	Around noon the sky turned dark and stayed that way until the middle of the afternoon .
42023045	The sun stopped shining , and the curtain in the temple split down the middle .
42023046	Jesus shouted , “ Father , I put myself in your hands ! ” Then he died .
42023047	When the Roman officer saw what had happened , he praised God and said , “ Jesus must really have been a good man ! ”
42023048	A crowd had gathered to see the terrible sight . Then after they had seen it , they felt brokenhearted and went home .
42023049	All of Jesus' close friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched .
42023052	Joseph went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body .
42023053	He took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in fine cloth . Then he put it in a tomb that had been cut out of solid rock and had never been used .
42023054	It was Friday , and the Sabbath was about to begin .
42023055	The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and watched how Jesus' body was placed in the tomb .
42023056	Then they went to prepare some sweet-smelling spices for his burial . But on the Sabbath they rested , as the Law of Moses commands .
42024001	Very early on Sunday morning the women went to the tomb , carrying the spices they had prepared .
42024002	When they found the stone rolled away from the entrance ,
42024003	they went in . But they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus ,
42024004	and they did not know what to think . Suddenly two men in shining white clothes stood beside them .
42024005	The women were afraid and bowed to the ground . But the men said , “ Why are you looking in the place of the dead for someone who is alive ?
42024006	Jesus isn't here ! He has been raised from death . Remember that while he was still in Galilee , he told you ,
42024007	‘ The Son of Man will be handed over to sinners who will nail him to a cross . But three days later he will rise to life . ’ ”
42024008	Then they remembered what Jesus had said .
42024011	The apostles thought it was all nonsense , and they would not believe .
42024012	But Peter ran to the tomb . And when he stooped down and looked in , he saw only the burial clothes . Then he returned , wondering what had happened .
42024013	That same day two of Jesus' disciples were going to the village of Emmaus , which was about eleven kilometers from Jerusalem .
42024014	As they were talking and thinking about what had happened ,
42024015	Jesus came near and started walking along beside them .
42024016	But they did not know who he was .
42024017	Jesus asked them , “ What were you talking about as you walked along ? ” The two of them stood there looking sad and gloomy .
42024018	Then the one named Cleopas asked Jesus , “ Are you the only person from Jerusalem who didn't know what was happening there these last few days ? ”
42024019	“ What do you mean ? ” Jesus asked . They answered :
42024025	Then Jesus asked the two disciples , “ Why can't you understand ? How can you be so slow to believe all that the prophets said ?
42024026	Didn't you know that the Messiah would have to suffer before he was given his glory ? ”
42024027	Jesus then explained everything written about himself in the Scriptures , beginning with the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets .
42024028	When the two of them came near the village where they were going , Jesus seemed to be going farther .
42024029	They begged him , “ Stay with us ! It's already late , and the sun is going down . ” So Jesus went into the house to stay with them .
42024030	After Jesus sat down to eat , he took some bread . He blessed it and broke it . Then he gave it to them .
42024031	At once they knew who he was , but he disappeared .
42024032	They said to each other , “ When he talked with us along the road and explained the Scriptures to us , didn't it warm our hearts ? ”
42024033	So they got up and returned to Jerusalem . The two disciples found the eleven apostles and the others gathered together .
42024034	And they learned from the group that the Lord was really alive and had appeared to Peter .
42024035	Then the disciples from Emmaus told what happened on the road and how they knew he was the Lord when he broke the bread .
42024036	While Jesus' disciples were talking about what had happened , Jesus appeared and greeted them .
42024037	They were frightened and terrified because they thought they were seeing a ghost .
42024038	But Jesus said , “ Why are you so frightened ? Why do you doubt ?
42024039	Look at my hands and my feet and see who I am ! Touch me and find out for yourselves . Ghosts don't have flesh and bones as you see I have . ”
42024040	After Jesus said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
42024041	The disciples were so glad and amazed that they could not believe it . Jesus then asked them , “ Do you have something to eat ? ”
42024042	They gave him a piece of broiled fish .
42024043	He took it and ate it as they watched .
42024044	Jesus said to them , “ While I was still with you , I told you that everything written about me in the Law of Moses , the Books of the Prophets , and in the Psalms had to happen . ”
42024045	Then he helped them understand the Scriptures .
42024046	He told them :
42024050	Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany , where he raised his hands and blessed them .
42024051	As he was doing this , he left and was taken up to heaven .
42024052	After his disciples had worshiped him , they returned to Jerusalem and were very happy .
42024053	They spent their time in the temple , praising God .
43001001	In the beginning was the one who is called the Word . The Word was with God and was truly God .
43001002	From the very beginning the Word was with God .
43001003	And with this Word , God created all things . Nothing was made without the Word . Everything that was created
43001004	received its life from him , and his life gave light to everyone .
43001005	The light keeps shining in the dark , and darkness has never put it out .
43001006	God sent a man named John ,
43001007	who came to tell about the light and to lead all people to have faith .
43001008	John wasn't this light . He came only to tell about the light .
43001009	The true light that shines on everyone was coming into the world .
43001010	The Word was in the world , but no one knew him , though God had made the world with his Word .
43001011	He came into his own world , but his own nation did not welcome him .
43001012	Yet some people accepted him and put their faith in him . So he gave them the right to be the children of God .
43001013	They were not God's children by nature or because of any human desires . God himself was the one who made them his children .
43001014	The Word became a human being and lived here with us . We saw his true glory , the glory of the only Son of the Father . From him the complete gifts of undeserved grace and truth have come down to us .
43001015	John spoke about him and shouted , “ This is the one I told you would come ! He is greater than I am , because he was alive before I was born . ”
43001016	Because of all that the Son is , we have been given one blessing after another .
43001017	The Law was given by Moses , but Jesus Christ brought us undeserved kindness and truth .
43001018	No one has ever seen God . The only Son , who is truly God and is closest to the Father , has shown us what God is like .
43001021	Then when they asked him if he were Elijah , he said , “ No , I am not ! ” And when they asked if he were the Prophet , he also said “ No ! ”
43001022	Finally , they said , “ Who are you then ? We have to give an answer to the ones who sent us . Tell us who you are ! ”
43001023	John answered in the words of the prophet Isaiah , “ I am only someone shouting in the desert , ‘ Get the road ready for the Lord ! ’ ”
43001024	Some Pharisees had also been sent to John .
43001025	They asked him , “ Why are you baptizing people , if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet ? ”
43001026	John told them , “ I use water to baptize people . But here with you is someone you don't know .
43001027	Even though I came first , I am not good enough to untie his sandals . ”
43001028	John said this as he was baptizing east of the Jordan River in Bethany .
43001029	The next day , John saw Jesus coming toward him and said :
43001035	The next day , John was there again , and two of his followers were with him .
43001036	When he saw Jesus walking by , he said , “ Here is the Lamb of God ! ”
43001037	John's two followers heard him , and they went with Jesus .
43001038	When Jesus turned and saw them , he asked , “ What do you want ? ” They answered , “ Rabbi , where do you live ? ” The Hebrew word “ Rabbi ” means “ Teacher . ”
43001039	Jesus replied , “ Come and see ! ” It was already about four o'clock in the afternoon when they went with him and saw where he lived . So they stayed on for the rest of the day .
43001040	One of the two men who had heard John and had gone with Jesus was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter .
43001041	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother and tell him , “ We have found the Messiah ! ” The Hebrew word “ Messiah ” means the same as the Greek word “ Christ . ”
43001042	Andrew brought his brother to Jesus . And when Jesus saw him , he said , “ Simon son of John , you will be called Cephas . ” This name can be translated as “ Peter . ”
43001045	Philip then found Nathanael and said , “ We have found the one that Moses and the Prophets wrote about . He is Jesus , the son of Joseph from Nazareth . ”
43001046	Nathanael asked , “ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” Philip answered , “ Come and see . ”
43001047	When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , he said , “ Here is a true descendant of our ancestor Israel . And he isn't deceitful . ”
43001048	“ How do you know me ? ” Nathanael asked . Jesus answered , “ Before Philip called you , I saw you under the fig tree . ”
43001049	Nathanael said , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God and the King of Israel ! ”
43001050	Jesus answered , “ Did you believe me just because I said that I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see something even greater .
43001051	I tell you for certain you will see heaven open and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of Man . ”
43002001	Three days later Mary , the mother of Jesus , was at a wedding feast in the village of Cana in Galilee .
43002002	Jesus and his disciples had also been invited and were there .
43002003	When the wine was all gone , Mary said to Jesus , “ They don't have any more wine . ”
43002004	Jesus replied , “ Mother , my time hasn't yet come ! You must not tell me what to do . ”
43002005	Mary then said to the servants , “ Do whatever Jesus tells you to do . ”
43002006	At the feast there were six stone water jars that were used by the people for washing themselves in the way that their religion said they must . Each jar held about 100 liters .
43002007	Jesus told the servants to fill them to the top with water . Then after the jars had been filled ,
43002008	he said , “ Now take some water and give it to the man in charge of the feast . ” The servants did as Jesus told them ,
43002009	and the man in charge drank some of the water that had now turned into wine . He did not know where the wine had come from , but the servants did . He called the bridegroom over
43002010	and said , “ The best wine is always served first . Then after the guests have had plenty , the other wine is served . But you have kept the best until last ! ”
43002011	This was Jesus' first miracle , and he did it in the village of Cana in Galilee . There Jesus showed his glory , and his disciples put their faith in him .
43002012	After this , he went with his mother , his brothers , and his disciples to the town of Capernaum , where they stayed for a few days .
43002013	Not long before the Jewish festival of Passover , Jesus went to Jerusalem .
43002014	There he found people selling cattle , sheep , and doves in the temple . He also saw moneychangers sitting at their tables .
43002015	So he took some rope and made a whip . Then he chased everyone out of the temple , together with their sheep and cattle . He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and scattered their coins .
43002016	Jesus said to the people who had been selling doves , “ Get those doves out of here ! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace . ”
43002017	The disciples then remembered that the Scriptures say , “ My love for your house burns in me like a fire . ”
43002018	The Jewish leaders asked Jesus , “ What miracle will you work to show us why you have done this ? ”
43002019	“ Destroy this temple , ” Jesus answered , “ and in three days I will build it again ! ”
43002020	The leaders replied , “ It took 46 years to build this temple . What makes you think you can rebuild it in three days ? ”
43002021	But Jesus was talking about his body as a temple .
43002022	And when he was raised from death , his disciples remembered what he had told them . Then they believed the Scriptures and the words of Jesus .
43002023	In Jerusalem during Passover many people put their faith in Jesus , because they saw him work miracles .
43002024	But Jesus knew what was in their hearts , and he would not let them have power over him .
43002025	No one had to tell him what people were like . He already knew .
43003001	There was a man named Nicodemus who was a Pharisee and a Jewish leader .
43003002	One night he went to Jesus and said , “ Rabbi , we know that God has sent you to teach us . You could not work these miracles , unless God were with you . ”
43003003	Jesus replied , “ I tell you for certain that you must be born from above before you can see God's kingdom ! ”
43003004	Nicodemus asked , “ How can a grown man ever be born a second time ? ”
43003005	Jesus answered :
43003009	“ How can this be ? ” Nicodemus asked .
43003010	Jesus replied :
43003022	Later , Jesus and his disciples went to Judea , where he stayed with them for a while and was baptizing people .
43003025	John's followers got into an argument with a Jewish man about a ceremony of washing .
43003026	They went to John and said , “ Rabbi , you spoke about a man when you were with him east of the Jordan . He is now baptizing people , and everyone is going to him . ”
43003027	John replied :
43004001	Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more followers than John was .
43004002	But Jesus' disciples were really the ones doing the baptizing , and not Jesus himself .
43004003	Jesus left Judea and started for Galilee again .
43004004	This time he had to go through Samaria ,
43004005	and on his way he came to the town of Sychar . It was near the field that Jacob had long ago given to his son Joseph .
43004009	“ You are a Jew , ” she replied , “ and I am a Samaritan woman . How can you ask me for a drink of water when Jews and Samaritans won't have anything to do with each other ? ”
43004010	Jesus answered , “ You don't know what God wants to give you , and you don't know who is asking you for a drink . If you did , you would ask me for the water that gives life . ”
43004011	“ Sir , ” the woman said , “ you don't even have a bucket , and the well is deep . Where are you going to get this life-giving water ?
43004012	Our ancestor Jacob dug this well for us , and his family and animals got water from it . Are you greater than Jacob ? ”
43004013	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again .
43004014	But no one who drinks the water I give will ever be thirsty again . The water I give will become in that person a flowing fountain that gives eternal life . ”
43004015	The woman replied , “ Sir , please give me a drink of that water ! Then I won't get thirsty and have to come to this well again . ”
43004016	Jesus told her , “ Go and bring your husband . ”
43004019	The woman said , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet .
43004020	My ancestors worshiped on this mountain , but you Jews say Jerusalem is the only place to worship . ”
43004021	Jesus said to her :
43004025	The woman said , “ I know that the Messiah will come . He is the one we call Christ . When he comes , he will explain everything to us . ”
43004026	“ I am that one , ” Jesus told her , “ and I am speaking to you now . ”
43004027	The disciples returned about this time and were surprised to find Jesus talking with a woman . But none of them asked him what he wanted or why he was talking with her .
43004028	The woman left her water jar and ran back into town , where she said to the people ,
43004029	“ Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done ! Could he be the Messiah ? ”
43004030	Everyone in town went out to see Jesus .
43004031	While this was happening , Jesus' disciples were saying to him , “ Teacher , please eat something . ”
43004032	But Jesus told them , “ I have food you don't know anything about . ”
43004033	His disciples started asking each other , “ Has someone brought him something to eat ? ”
43004034	Jesus said :
43004039	A lot of Samaritans in that town put their faith in Jesus because the woman had said , “ This man told me everything I have ever done . ”
43004040	They came and asked him to stay in their town , and he stayed on for two days .
43004041	Many more Samaritans put their faith in Jesus because of what they heard him say .
43004042	They told the woman , “ We no longer have faith in Jesus just because of what you told us . We have heard him ourselves , and we are certain that he is the Savior of the world ! ”
43004045	and went to Galilee . The people there welcomed him , because they had gone to the festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything he had done .
43004046	While Jesus was in Galilee , he returned to the village of Cana , where he had turned the water into wine . There was an official in Capernaum whose son was sick .
43004047	And when the man heard that Jesus had come from Judea , he went and begged him to keep his son from dying .
43004048	Jesus told the official , “ You won't have faith unless you see miracles and wonders ! ”
43004049	The man replied , “ Lord , please come before my son dies ! ”
43004050	Jesus then said , “ Your son will live . Go on home to him . ” The man believed Jesus and started back home .
43004051	Some of the official's servants met him along the road and told him , “ Your son is better ! ”
43004052	He asked them when the boy got better , and they answered , “ The fever left him yesterday at one o'clock . ”
43004053	The boy's father realized that at one o'clock the day before , Jesus had told him , “ Your son will live ! ” So the man and everyone in his family put their faith in Jesus .
43004054	This was the second miracle that Jesus worked after he left Judea and went to Galilee .
43005001	Later , Jesus went to Jerusalem for another Jewish festival .
43005002	In the city near the sheep gate was a pool with five porches , and its name in Hebrew was Bethzatha .
43005005	Beside the pool was a man who had been sick for 38 years .
43005006	When Jesus saw the man and realized that he had been crippled for a long time , he asked him , “ Do you want to be healed ? ”
43005007	The man answered , “ Sir , I don't have anyone to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up . I try to get in , but someone else always gets there first . ”
43005008	Jesus told him , “ Pick up your mat and walk ! ”
43005009	Right then the man was healed . He picked up his mat and started walking around . The day on which this happened was a Sabbath .
43005010	When the Jewish leaders saw the man carrying his mat , they said to him , “ This is the Sabbath ! No one is allowed to carry a mat on the Sabbath . ”
43005011	But he replied , “ The man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and walk . ”
43005012	They asked him , “ Who is this man that told you to pick up your mat and walk ? ”
43005013	But he did not know who Jesus was , and Jesus had left because of the crowd .
43005014	Later , Jesus met the man in the temple and told him , “ You are now well . But don't sin anymore or something worse might happen to you . ”
43005015	The man left and told the leaders that Jesus was the one who had healed him .
43005016	They started making a lot of trouble for Jesus because he did things like this on the Sabbath .
43005017	But Jesus said , “ My Father has never stopped working , and this is why I keep on working . ”
43005018	Now the leaders wanted to kill Jesus for two reasons . First , he had broken the law of the Sabbath . But even worse , he had said God was his Father , which made him equal with God .
43005019	Jesus told the people :
43006001	Jesus crossed Lake Galilee , which was also known as Lake Tiberias .
43006002	A large crowd had seen him work miracles to heal the sick , and those people went with him .
43006005	When Jesus saw the large crowd coming toward him , he asked Philip , “ Where will we get enough food to feed all these people ? ”
43006006	He said this to test Philip , since he already knew what he was going to do .
43006007	Philip answered , “ Don't you know that it would take almost a year's wages just to buy only a little bread for each of these people ? ”
43006008	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the disciples . He spoke up and said ,
43006009	“ There is a boy here who has five small loaves of barley bread and two fish . But what good is that with all these people ? ”
43006010	The ground was covered with grass , and Jesus told his disciples to tell everyone to sit down . About 5,000 men were in the crowd .
43006011	Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave thanks to God . Then he passed the bread to the people , and he did the same with the fish , until everyone had plenty to eat .
43006012	The people ate all they wanted , and Jesus told his disciples to gather up the leftovers , so that nothing would be wasted .
43006013	The disciples gathered them up and filled twelve large baskets with what was left over from the five barley loaves .
43006014	After the people had seen Jesus work this miracle , they began saying , “ This must be the Prophet who is to come into the world ! ”
43006015	Jesus realized that they would try to force him to be their king . So he went up on a mountain , where he could be alone .
43006016	That evening , Jesus' disciples went down to the lake .
43006017	They got into a boat and started across for Capernaum . Later that evening Jesus had still not come to them ,
43006018	and a strong wind was making the water rough .
43006019	When the disciples had rowed for five or six kilometers , they saw Jesus walking on the water . He kept coming closer to the boat , and they were terrified .
43006020	But he said , “ I am Jesus ! Don't be afraid ! ”
43006021	The disciples wanted to take him into the boat , but suddenly the boat reached the shore where they were headed .
43006022	The people who had stayed on the east side of the lake knew that only one boat had been there . They also knew that Jesus had not left in it with his disciples . But the next day
43006023	some boats from Tiberias sailed near the place where the crowd had eaten the bread for which the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	They saw that Jesus and his disciples had left . Then they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus .
43006025	They found him on the west side of the lake and asked , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
43006026	Jesus answered , “ I tell you for certain that you are not looking for me because you saw the miracles , but because you ate all the food you wanted .
43006027	Don't work for food that spoils . Work for food that gives eternal life . The Son of Man will give you this food , because God the Father has given him the right to do so . ”
43006028	“ What exactly does God want us to do ? ” the people asked .
43006029	Jesus answered , “ God wants you to have faith in the one he sent . ”
43006030	They replied , “ What miracle will you work , so that we can have faith in you ? What will you do ?
43006031	For example , when our ancestors were in the desert , they were given manna to eat . It happened just as the Scriptures say , ‘ God gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
43006032	Jesus then told them , “ I tell you for certain that Moses wasn't the one who gave you bread from heaven . My Father is the one who gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	And the bread that God gives is the one who came down from heaven to give life to the world . ”
43006034	The people said , “ Sir , give us this bread and don't ever stop ! ”
43006035	Jesus replied :
43006041	The people started grumbling because Jesus had said he was the bread that had come down from heaven .
43006042	They were asking each other , “ Isn't he Jesus , the son of Joseph ? Don't we know his father and mother ? How can he say that he has come down from heaven ? ”
43006043	Jesus told them :
43006052	They started arguing with each other and asked , “ How can he give us his flesh to eat ? ”
43006053	Jesus answered :
43006059	Jesus was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum when he said these things .
43006060	Many of Jesus' disciples heard him and said , “ This is too hard for anyone to understand . ”
43006061	Jesus knew that his disciples were grumbling . So he asked , “ Does this bother you ?
43006062	What if you should see the Son of Man go up to heaven where he came from ?
43006063	The Spirit is the one who gives life ! Human strength can do nothing . The words that I have spoken to you are from that life-giving Spirit .
43006064	But some of you refuse to have faith in me . ” Jesus said this , because from the beginning he knew who would have faith in him . He also knew which one would betray him .
43006065	Then Jesus said , “ You cannot come to me , unless the Father makes you want to come . That is why I have told these things to all of you . ”
43006066	Because of what Jesus said , many of his disciples turned their backs on him and stopped following him .
43006067	Jesus then asked his twelve disciples if they also were going to leave him .
43006068	Simon Peter answered , “ Lord , there is no one else that we can go to ! Your words give eternal life .
43006069	We have faith in you , and we are sure that you are God's Holy One . ”
43006070	Jesus told his disciples , “ I chose all twelve of you , but one of you is a demon ! ”
43006071	Jesus was talking about Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . He would later betray Jesus , even though he was one of the twelve disciples .
43007001	Jesus decided to leave Judea and to start going through Galilee because the leaders of the people wanted to kill him .
43007002	It was almost time for the Festival of Shelters ,
43007003	and Jesus' brothers said to him , “ Why don't you go to Judea ? Then your disciples can see what you are doing .
43007004	No one does anything in secret , if they want others to know about them . So let the world know what you are doing ! ”
43007005	Even Jesus' own brothers had not yet become his followers .
43007006	Jesus answered , “ My time hasn't yet come , but your time is always here .
43007007	The people of this world cannot hate you . They hate me , because I tell them that they do evil things .
43007008	Go on to the festival . My time hasn't yet come , and I am not going . ”
43007009	Jesus said this and stayed on in Galilee .
43007010	After Jesus' brothers had gone to the festival , he went secretly , without telling anyone .
43007011	During the festival the leaders of the people looked for Jesus and asked , “ Where is he ? ”
43007012	The crowds even got into an argument about him . Some were saying , “ Jesus is a good man , ” while others were saying , “ He is lying to everyone . ”
43007013	But the people were afraid of their leaders , and none of them talked in public about him .
43007014	When the festival was about half over , Jesus went into the temple and started teaching .
43007015	The leaders were surprised and said , “ How does this man know so much ? He has never been taught ! ”
43007016	Jesus replied :
43007020	The crowd replied , “ You're crazy ! What makes you think someone wants to kill you ? ”
43007021	Jesus answered :
43007025	Some of the people from Jerusalem were saying , “ Isn't this the man they want to kill ?
43007026	Yet here he is , speaking for everyone to hear . And no one is arguing with him . Do you suppose the authorities know he is the Messiah ?
43007027	But how could that be ? No one knows where the Messiah will come from , but we know where this man comes from . ”
43007028	As Jesus was teaching in the temple , he shouted , “ Do you really think you know me and where I came from ? I didn't come on my own ! The one who sent me is truthful , and you don't know him .
43007029	But I know the one who sent me , because I came from him . ”
43007030	Some of the people wanted to arrest Jesus right then . But no one even laid a hand on him , because his time had not yet come .
43007031	A lot of people in the crowd put their faith in him and said , “ When the Messiah comes , he surely won't perform more miracles than this man has done ! ”
43007032	When the Pharisees heard the crowd arguing about Jesus , they got together with the chief priests and sent some temple police to arrest him .
43007033	But Jesus told them , “ I will be with you a little while longer , and then I will return to the one who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me , but you won't find me . You cannot go where I am going . ”
43007035	The people asked each other , “ Where can he go to keep us from finding him ? Is he going to some foreign country where our people live ? Is he going there to teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What did he mean by saying that we will look for him , but won't find him ? Why can't we go where he is going ? ”
43007037	On the last and most important day of the festival , Jesus stood up and shouted , “ If you are thirsty , come to me and drink !
43007038	Have faith in me , and you will have life-giving water flowing from deep inside you , just as the Scriptures say . ”
43007039	Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit , who would be given to everyone that had faith in him . The Spirit had not yet been given to anyone , since Jesus had not yet been given his full glory .
43007040	When the crowd heard Jesus say this , some of them said , “ He must be the Prophet ! ”
43007041	Others said , “ He is the Messiah ! ” Others even said , “ Can the Messiah come from Galilee ?
43007042	The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David . Doesn't this mean that he will be born in David's hometown of Bethlehem ? ”
43007043	The people started taking sides against each other because of Jesus .
43007044	Some of them wanted to arrest him , but no one laid a hand on him .
43007045	When the temple police returned to the chief priests and Pharisees , they were asked , “ Why didn't you bring Jesus here ? ”
43007046	They answered , “ No one has ever spoken like this man ! ”
43007047	The Pharisees said to them , “ Have you also been fooled ?
43007048	Not one of the chief priests or the Pharisees has faith in him .
43007049	And these people who don't know the Law are under God's curse anyway . ”
43007050	Nicodemus was there at the time . He was a member of the council , and was the same one who had earlier come to see Jesus . He said ,
43007051	“ Our Law doesn't let us condemn people before we hear what they have to say . We cannot judge them before we know what they have done . ”
43007052	Then they said , “ Nicodemus , you must be from Galilee ! Read the Scriptures , and you will find that no prophet is to come from Galilee . ”
43007053	Everyone else went home ,
43008003	The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law of Moses brought in a woman who had been caught in bed with a man who wasn't her husband . They made her stand in the middle of the crowd .
43008004	Then they said , “ Teacher , this woman was caught sleeping with a man who isn't her husband .
43008005	The Law of Moses teaches that a woman like this should be stoned to death ! What do you say ? ”
43008006	They asked Jesus this question , because they wanted to test him and bring some charge against him . But Jesus simply bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger .
43008007	They kept on asking Jesus about the woman . Finally , he stood up and said , “ If any of you have never sinned , then go ahead and throw the first stone at her ! ”
43008008	Once again he bent over and began writing on the ground .
43008009	The people left one by one , beginning with the oldest . Finally , Jesus and the woman were there alone .
43008010	Jesus stood up and asked her , “ Where is everyone ? Isn't there anyone left to accuse you ? ”
43008011	“ No sir , ” the woman answered . Then Jesus told her , “ I am not going to accuse you either . You may go now , but don't sin anymore . ”
43008012	Once again Jesus spoke to the people . This time he said , “ I am the light for the world ! Follow me , and you won't be walking in the dark . You will have the light that gives life . ”
43008013	The Pharisees objected , “ You are the only one speaking for yourself , and what you say isn't true ! ”
43008014	Jesus replied :
43008019	“ Where is your Father ? ” they asked . “ You don't know me or my Father ! ” Jesus answered . “ If you knew me , you would know my Father . ”
43008020	Jesus said this while he was still teaching in the place where the temple treasures were stored . But no one arrested him , because his time had not yet come .
43008021	Jesus also told them , “ I am going away , and you will look for me . But you cannot go where I am going , and you will die with your sins unforgiven . ”
43008022	The people asked , “ Does he intend to kill himself ? Is that what he means by saying we cannot go where he is going ? ”
43008023	Jesus answered , “ You are from below , but I am from above . You belong to this world , but I don't .
43008024	This is why I said you will die with your sins unforgiven . If you don't have faith in me for who I am , you will die , and your sins will not be forgiven . ”
43008025	“ Who are you ? ” they asked Jesus . Jesus answered , “ I am exactly who I told you at the beginning .
43008026	There is a lot more I could say to condemn you . But the one who sent me is truthful , and I tell the people of this world only what I have heard from him . ”
43008027	No one understood that Jesus was talking to them about the Father .
43008028	Jesus went on to say , “ When you have lifted up the Son of Man , you will know who I am . You will also know that I don't do anything on my own . I say only what my Father taught me .
43008029	The one who sent me is with me . I always do what pleases him , and he will never leave me . ”
43008030	After Jesus said this , many of the people put their faith in him .
43008031	Jesus told the people who had faith in him , “ If you keep on obeying what I have said , you truly are my disciples .
43008032	You will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
43008033	They answered , “ We are Abraham's children ! We have never been anyone's slaves . How can you say we will be set free ? ”
43008034	Jesus replied :
43008039	The people said to Jesus , “ Abraham is our father ! ” Jesus replied , “ If you were Abraham's children , you would do what Abraham did .
43008040	Instead , you want to kill me for telling you the truth that God gave me . Abraham never did anything like that .
43008041	But you are doing exactly what your father does . ” “ Don't accuse us of having someone else as our father ! ” they said . “ We just have one father , and he is God . ”
43008042	Jesus answered :
43008048	The people told Jesus , “ We were right to say that you are a Samaritan and that you have a demon in you ! ”
43008049	Jesus answered , “ I don't have a demon in me . I honor my Father , and you refuse to honor me .
43008050	I don't want honor for myself . But there is one who wants me to be honored , and he is also the one who judges .
43008051	I tell you for certain that if you obey my words , you will never die . ”
43008052	Then the people said , “ Now we are sure that you have a demon . Abraham is dead , and so are the prophets . How can you say that no one who obeys your words will ever die ?
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and so did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? ”
43008054	Jesus replied , “ If I honored myself , it would mean nothing . My Father is the one who honors me . You claim that he is your God ,
43008055	even though you don't really know him . If I said I didn't know him , I would be a liar , just like all of you . But I know him , and I do what he says .
43008056	Your father Abraham was really glad to see me . ”
43008057	“ You are not even 50 years old ! ” they said . “ How could you have seen Abraham ? ”
43008058	Jesus answered , “ I tell you for certain that even before Abraham was , I was , and I am . ”
43008059	The people picked up stones to kill Jesus , but he hid and left the temple .
43009001	As Jesus walked along , he saw a man who had been blind since birth .
43009002	Jesus' disciples asked , “ Teacher , why was this man born blind ? Was it because he or his parents sinned ? ”
43009003	“ No , it wasn't ! ” Jesus answered . “ But because of his blindness , you will see God work a miracle for him .
43009004	As long as it is day , we must do what the one who sent me wants me to do . When night comes , no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world , I am the light for the world . ”
43009006	After Jesus said this , he spit on the ground . He made some mud and smeared it on the man's eyes .
43009007	Then he said , “ Go wash off the mud in Siloam Pool . ” The man went and washed in Siloam , which means “ One Who Is Sent . ” When he had washed off the mud , he could see .
43009008	The man's neighbors and the people who had seen him begging wondered if he really could be the same man .
43009009	Some of them said he was the same beggar , while others said he only looked like him . But he told them , “ I am that man . ”
43009010	“ Then how can you see ? ” they asked .
43009011	He answered , “ Someone named Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes . He told me to go and wash it off in Siloam Pool . When I did , I could see . ”
43009012	“ Where is he now ? ” they asked . “ I don't know , ” he answered .
43009015	They asked him how he was able to see , and he answered , “ Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes . Then after I washed it off , I could see . ”
43009016	Some of the Pharisees said , “ This man Jesus doesn't come from God . If he did , he would not break the law of the Sabbath . ” Others asked , “ How could someone who is a sinner work such a miracle ? ” Since the Pharisees could not agree among themselves ,
43009017	they asked the man , “ What do you say about this one who healed your eyes ? ” “ He is a prophet ! ” the man told them .
43009018	But the Jewish leaders would not believe that the man had once been blind . They sent for his parents
43009019	and asked them , “ Is this the son that you said was born blind ? How can he now see ? ”
43009020	The man's parents answered , “ We are certain that he is our son , and we know that he was born blind .
43009021	But we don't know how he got his sight or who gave it to him . Ask him ! He is old enough to speak for himself . ”
43009024	The leaders called the man back and said , “ Swear by God to tell the truth ! We know that Jesus is a sinner . ”
43009025	The man replied , “ I don't know if he is a sinner or not . All I know is that I used to be blind , but now I can see ! ”
43009026	“ What did he do to you ? ” they asked . “ How did he heal your eyes ? ”
43009027	The man answered , “ I have already told you once , and you refused to listen . Why do you want me to tell you again ? Do you also want to become his disciples ? ”
43009028	The leaders insulted the man and said , “ You are his follower ! We are followers of Moses .
43009029	We are sure God spoke to Moses , but we don't even know where Jesus comes from . ”
43009030	“ How strange ! ” the man replied . “ He healed my eyes , and yet you don't know where he comes from .
43009031	We know that God listens only to people who love and obey him . God doesn't listen to sinners .
43009032	And this is the first time in history anyone has ever given sight to someone born blind .
43009033	Jesus could not do anything unless he came from God . ”
43009034	The leaders told the man , “ You have been a sinner since the day you were born ! Do you think you can teach us anything ? ” Then they said , “ You can never come back into any of our synagogues ! ”
43009035	When Jesus heard what had happened , he went and found the man . Then Jesus asked , “ Do you have faith in the Son of Man ? ”
43009036	He replied , “ Sir , if you will tell me who he is , I will put my faith in him . ”
43009037	“ You have already seen him , ” Jesus answered , “ and right now he is talking with you . ”
43009038	The man said , “ Lord , I put my faith in you ! ” Then he worshiped Jesus .
43009039	Jesus told him , “ I came to judge the people of this world . I am here to give sight to the blind and to make blind everyone who can see . ”
43009040	When the Pharisees heard Jesus say this , they asked , “ Are we blind ? ”
43009041	Jesus answered , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty . But now that you claim to see , you will keep on being guilty . ”
43010001	Jesus said :
43010006	Jesus told the people this story . But they did not understand what he was talking about .
43010007	Jesus said :
43010019	The people took sides because of what Jesus had told them .
43010020	Many of them said , “ He has a demon in him ! He is crazy ! Why listen to him ? ”
43010021	But others said , “ How could anyone with a demon in him say these things ? No one like this could give sight to a blind person ! ”
43010022	That winter , Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Temple Festival .
43010023	One day he was walking in the part of the temple known as Solomon's Porch ,
43010024	and the people gathered all around him . They said , “ How long are you going to keep us guessing ? If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly ! ”
43010025	Jesus answered :
43010031	Once again the people picked up stones in order to kill Jesus .
43010032	But he said , “ I have shown you many good things my Father sent me to do . Which one are you going to stone me for ? ”
43010033	They answered , “ We are not stoning you because of any good thing you did . We are stoning you because you did a terrible thing . You are just a man , and here you are claiming to be God ! ”
43010034	Jesus replied :
43010039	Again they wanted to arrest Jesus . But he escaped
43010040	and crossed the Jordan to the place where John had earlier been baptizing . While Jesus was there ,
43010041	many people came to him . They were saying , “ John didn't work any miracles , but everything he said about Jesus is true . ”
43010042	A lot of those people also put their faith in Jesus .
43011003	The sisters sent a message to the Lord and told him that his good friend Lazarus was sick .
43011004	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ His sickness won't end in death . It will bring glory to God and his Son . ”
43011005	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and brother .
43011006	But he stayed where he was for two more days .
43011007	Then he said to his disciples , “ Now we will go back to Judea . ”
43011008	“ Teacher , ” they said , “ the people there want to stone you to death ! Why do you want to go back ? ”
43011009	Jesus answered , “ Aren't there twelve hours in each day ? If you walk during the day , you will have light from the sun , and you won't stumble .
43011010	But if you walk during the night , you will stumble , because you don't have any light . ”
43011011	Then he told them , “ Our friend Lazarus is asleep , and I am going there to wake him up . ”
43011012	They replied , “ Lord , if he is asleep , he will get better . ”
43011013	Jesus really meant that Lazarus was dead , but they thought he was talking only about sleep .
43011014	Then Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead !
43011015	I am glad I wasn't there , because now you will have a chance to put your faith in me . Let's go to him . ”
43011016	Thomas , whose nickname was “ Twin , ” said to the other disciples , “ Come on . Let's go , so we can die with him . ”
43011017	When Jesus got to Bethany , he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days .
43011018	Bethany was less than three kilometers from Jerusalem ,
43011019	and many people had come from the city to comfort Martha and Mary because their brother had died .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus had arrived , she went out to meet him , but Mary stayed in the house .
43011021	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	Yet even now I know that God will do anything you ask . ”
43011023	Jesus told her , “ Your brother will live again ! ”
43011024	Martha answered , “ I know he will be raised to life on the last day , when all the dead are raised . ”
43011025	Jesus then said , “ I am the one who raises the dead to life ! Everyone who has faith in me will live , even if they die .
43011026	And everyone who lives because of faith in me will never really die . Do you believe this ? ”
43011027	“ Yes , Lord ! ” she replied . “ I believe you are the Christ , the Son of God . You are the one we hoped would come into the world . ”
43011028	After Martha said this , she went and privately said to her sister Mary , “ The Teacher is here , and he wants to see you . ”
43011029	As soon as Mary heard this , she got up and went out to Jesus .
43011030	He was still outside the village where Martha had gone to meet him .
43011031	Many people had come to comfort Mary , and when they saw her quickly leave the house , they thought she was going out to the tomb to cry . So they followed her .
43011032	Mary went to where Jesus was . Then as soon as she saw him , she knelt at his feet and said , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . ”
43011033	When Jesus saw that Mary and the people with her were crying , he was terribly upset
43011034	and asked , “ Where have you put his body ? ” They replied , “ Lord , come and you will see . ”
43011035	Jesus started crying ,
43011036	and the people said , “ See how much he loved Lazarus . ”
43011037	Some of them said , “ He gives sight to the blind . Why couldn't he have kept Lazarus from dying ? ”
43011038	Jesus was still terribly upset . So he went to the tomb , which was a cave with a stone rolled against the entrance .
43011039	Then he told the people to roll the stone away . But Martha said , “ Lord , you know that Lazarus has been dead four days , and there will be a bad smell . ”
43011040	Jesus replied , “ Didn't I tell you that if you had faith , you would see the glory of God ? ”
43011041	After the stone had been rolled aside , Jesus looked up toward heaven and prayed , “ Father , I thank you for answering my prayer .
43011042	I know that you always answer my prayers . But I said this , so the people here would believe you sent me . ”
43011043	When Jesus had finished praying , he shouted , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
43011044	The man who had been dead came out . His hands and feet were wrapped with strips of burial cloth , and a cloth covered his face . Jesus then told the people , “ Untie him and let him go . ”
43011045	Many of the people who had come to visit Mary saw the things Jesus did , and they put their faith in him .
43011046	Others went to the Pharisees and told what Jesus had done .
43011047	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said , “ What should we do ? This man is working a lot of miracles .
43011048	If we don't stop him now , everyone will put their faith in him . Then the Romans will come and destroy our temple and our nation . ”
43011049	One of the council members was Caiaphas , who was also high priest that year . He spoke up and said , “ You people don't have any sense at all !
43011050	Don't you know it is better for one person to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed ? ”
43011051	Caiaphas did not say this on his own . As high priest that year , he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation .
43011052	Yet Jesus would not die just for the Jewish nation . He would die to bring together all of God's scattered people .
43011053	From that day on , the council started making plans to put Jesus to death .
43011054	Because of this plot against him , Jesus stopped going around in public . He went to the town of Ephraim , which was near the desert , and he stayed there with his disciples .
43011055	It was almost time for Passover . Many of the Jewish people who lived out in the country had come to Jerusalem to get themselves ready for the festival .
43011056	They looked around for Jesus . Then when they were in the temple , they asked each other , “ You don't think he will come here for Passover , do you ? ”
43011057	The chief priests and the Pharisees told the people to let them know if any of them saw Jesus . This is how they hoped to arrest him .
43012001	Six days before Passover Jesus went back to Bethany , where he had raised Lazarus from death .
43012002	A meal had been prepared for Jesus . Martha was doing the serving , and Lazarus himself was there .
43012003	Mary took a very expensive bottle of perfume and poured it on Jesus' feet . She wiped them with her hair , and the sweet smell of the perfume filled the house .
43012004	A disciple named Judas Iscariot was there . He was the one who was going to betray Jesus , and he asked ,
43012005	“ Why wasn't this perfume sold for 300 silver coins and the money given to the poor ? ”
43012006	Judas did not really care about the poor . He asked this because he carried the moneybag and sometimes would steal from it .
43012007	Jesus replied , “ Leave her alone ! She has kept this perfume for the day of my burial .
43012008	You will always have the poor with you , but you won't always have me . ”
43012009	A lot of people came when they heard that Jesus was there . They also wanted to see Lazarus , because Jesus had raised him from death .
43012010	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus .
43012011	He was the reason that many of the people were turning from them and putting their faith in Jesus .
43012012	The next day a large crowd was in Jerusalem for Passover . When they heard that Jesus was coming for the festival ,
43012013	they took palm branches and went out to greet him . They shouted , “ Hooray ! God bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! God bless the King of Israel ! ”
43012014	Jesus found a donkey and rode on it , just as the Scriptures say ,
43012015	“ People of Jerusalem , don't be afraid ! Your King is now coming , and he is riding on a donkey . ”
43012016	At first , Jesus' disciples did not understand . But after he had been given his glory , they remembered all this . Everything had happened exactly as the Scriptures said it would .
43012019	But the Pharisees said to each other , “ There is nothing we can do ! Everyone in the world is following Jesus . ”
43012020	Some Greeks had gone to Jerusalem to worship during Passover .
43012021	Philip from Bethsaida in Galilee was there too . So they went to him and said , “ Sir , we would like to meet Jesus . ”
43012022	Philip told Andrew . Then the two of them went to Jesus and told him .
43012023	Jesus said : A voice from heaven then said , “ I have already brought glory to myself , and I will do it again ! ”
43012029	When the crowd heard the voice , some of them thought it was thunder . Others thought an angel had spoken to Jesus .
43012030	Then Jesus told the crowd , “ That voice spoke to help you , not me .
43012031	This world's people are now being judged , and the ruler of this world is already being thrown out !
43012032	If I am lifted up above the earth , I will make everyone want to come to me . ”
43012033	Jesus was talking about the way he would be put to death .
43012034	The crowd said to Jesus , “ The Scriptures teach that the Messiah will live forever . How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
43012035	Jesus answered , “ The light will be with you for only a little longer . Walk in the light while you can . Then you won't be caught walking blindly in the dark .
43012036	Have faith in the light while it is with you , and you will be children of the light . ” After Jesus had said these things , he left and went into hiding .
43012037	He had worked a lot of miracles among the people , but they were still not willing to have faith in him .
43012038	This happened so that what the prophet Isaiah had said would come true , “ Lord , who has believed our message ? And who has seen your mighty strength ? ”
43012040	“ The Lord has blinded the eyes of the people , and he has made the people stubborn . He did this so that they could not see or understand , and so that they would not turn to the Lord and be healed . ”
43012041	Isaiah said this , because he saw the glory of Jesus and spoke about him .
43012042	Even then , many of the leaders put their faith in Jesus , but they did not tell anyone about it . The Pharisees had already given orders for the people not to have anything to do with anyone who had faith in Jesus .
43012043	And besides , the leaders liked praise from others more than they liked praise from God .
43012044	In a loud voice Jesus said :
43013001	It was before Passover , and Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and to return to the Father . He had always loved his followers in this world , and he loved them to the very end .
43013002	Even before the evening meal started , the devil had made Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , decide to betray Jesus .
43013003	Jesus knew he had come from God and would go back to God . He also knew that the Father had given him complete power .
43013004	So during the meal Jesus got up , removed his outer garment , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
43013005	He put some water into a large bowl . Then he began washing his disciples' feet and drying them with the towel he was wearing .
43013006	But when he came to Simon Peter , this disciple asked , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
43013007	Jesus answered , “ You don't really know what I am doing , but later you will understand . ”
43013008	“ You will never wash my feet ! ” Peter replied . “ If I don't wash you , ” Jesus told him , “ you don't really belong to me . ”
43013009	Peter said , “ Lord , don't wash just my feet . Wash my hands and my head . ”
43013010	Jesus answered , “ People who have bathed and are clean all over need to wash just their feet . And you , my disciples , are clean , except for one of you . ”
43013011	Jesus knew who would betray him . That is why he said , “ except for one of you . ”
43013012	After Jesus had washed his disciples' feet and had put his outer garment back on , he sat down again . Then he said :
43013021	After Jesus had said these things , he was deeply troubled and told his disciples , “ I tell you for certain that one of you will betray me . ”
43013022	They were confused about what he meant . And they just stared at each other .
43013023	Jesus' favorite disciple was sitting next to him at the meal ,
43013024	and Simon motioned for this disciple to find out which one Jesus meant .
43013025	So the disciple leaned toward Jesus and asked , “ Lord , which one of us are you talking about ? ”
43013026	Jesus answered , “ I will dip this piece of bread in the sauce and give it to the one I was talking about . ” Then Jesus dipped the bread and gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	Right then Satan took control of Judas . Jesus said , “ Judas , go quickly and do what you have to do . ”
43013028	No one at the meal understood what Jesus meant .
43013029	But because Judas was in charge of the money , some of them thought that Jesus had told him to buy something they needed for the festival . Others thought that Jesus had told him to give some money to the poor .
43013030	Judas took the piece of bread and went out . It was already night .
43013031	After Judas had gone , Jesus said :
43013036	Simon Peter asked , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered , “ You can't go with me now , but later on you will . ”
43013037	Peter asked , “ Lord , why can't I go with you now ? I would die for you ! ”
43013038	“ Would you really die for me ? ” Jesus asked . “ I tell you for certain before a rooster crows , you will say three times that you don't even know me . ”
43014001	Jesus said to his disciples , “ Don't be worried ! Have faith in God and have faith in me .
43014002	There are many rooms in my Father's house . I wouldn't tell you this , unless it was true . I am going there to prepare a place for each of you .
43014003	After I have done this , I will come back and take you with me . Then we will be together .
43014004	You know the way to where I am going . ”
43014005	Thomas said , “ Lord , we don't even know where you are going ! How can we know the way ? ”
43014006	“ I am the way , the truth , and the life ! ” Jesus answered . “ Without me , no one can go to the Father .
43014007	If you had really known me , you would have known the Father . But from now on , you do know him , and you have seen him . ”
43014008	Philip said , “ Lord , show us the Father . That is all we need . ”
43014009	Jesus replied :
43014015	Jesus said to his disciples :
43014022	The other Judas , not Judas Iscariot , then spoke up and asked , “ Lord , what do you mean by saying that you will show us what you are like , but you will not show the people of this world ? ”
43014023	Jesus replied :
43015001	Jesus said to his disciples :
43016016	Jesus told his disciples , “ For a little while you won't see me , but after a while you will see me . ”
43016017	They said to each other , “ What does Jesus mean by saying that for a little while we won't see him , but after a while we will see him ? What does he mean by saying he is going to the Father ?
43016018	What is this ‘ little while ’ that he is talking about ? We don't know what he means . ”
43016019	Jesus knew they had some questions , so he said :
43016029	The disciples said , “ Now you are speaking plainly to us ! You are not using examples .
43016030	At last we know that you understand everything , and we don't have any more questions . Now we believe you truly have come from God . ”
43016031	Jesus replied :
43017001	After Jesus had finished speaking to his disciples , he looked up toward heaven and prayed :
43018001	When Jesus had finished praying , he and his disciples crossed the Kidron Valley and went into a garden .
43018002	Jesus had often met there with his disciples , and Judas knew where the place was .
43018006	At once they all backed away and fell to the ground .
43018007	Jesus again asked , “ Who are you looking for ? ” “ We are looking for Jesus from Nazareth , ” they answered .
43018008	This time Jesus replied , “ I have already told you that I am Jesus . If I am the one you are looking for , let these others go .
43018009	Then everything will happen , just as I said , ‘ I did not lose anyone you gave me . ’ ”
43018010	Simon Peter had brought along a sword . He pulled it out and struck at Malchus , the servant of the high priest , cutting off his right ear .
43018011	Jesus told Peter , “ Put your sword away . I must drink from the cup that the Father has given me . ”
43018012	The Roman officer and his men , together with the temple police , arrested Jesus and tied him up .
43018013	They took him first to Annas , who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year .
43018014	This was the same Caiaphas who had told the Jewish leaders , “ It is better if one person dies for the people . ”
43018015	Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus . That disciple knew the high priest , and he followed Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest's house .
43018016	Peter stayed outside near the gate . But the other disciple came back out and spoke to the girl at the gate . She let Peter go in ,
43018017	but asked him , “ Aren't you one of that man's followers ? ” “ No , I am not ! ” Peter answered .
43018018	It was cold , and the servants and temple police had made a charcoal fire . They were warming themselves around it , when Peter went over and stood near the fire to warm himself .
43018019	The high priest questioned Jesus about his followers and his teaching .
43018020	But Jesus told him , “ I have spoken freely in front of everyone . And I have always taught in our synagogues and in the temple , where all of our people come together . I have not said anything in secret .
43018021	Why are you questioning me ? Why don't you ask the people who heard me ? They know what I have said . ”
43018022	As soon as Jesus said this , one of the temple police hit him and said , “ That's no way to talk to the high priest ! ”
43018023	Jesus answered , “ If I have done something wrong , say so . But if not , why did you hit me ? ”
43018024	Jesus was still tied up , and Annas sent him to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	While Simon Peter was standing there warming himself , someone asked him , “ Aren't you one of Jesus' followers ? ” Again Peter denied it and said , “ No , I am not ! ”
43018026	One of the high priest's servants was there . He was a relative of the servant whose ear Peter had cut off , and he asked , “ Didn't I see you in the garden with that man ? ”
43018027	Once more Peter denied it , and right then a rooster crowed .
43018028	It was early in the morning when Jesus was taken from Caiaphas to the building where the Roman governor stayed . But the crowd waited outside . Any of them who had gone inside would have become unclean and would not be allowed to eat the Passover meal .
43018029	Pilate came out and asked , “ What charges are you bringing against this man ? ”
43018030	They answered , “ He is a criminal ! That's why we brought him to you . ”
43018031	Pilate told them , “ Take him and judge him by your own laws . ” The crowd replied , “ We are not allowed to put anyone to death . ”
43018032	And so what Jesus said about his death would soon come true .
43018033	Pilate then went back inside . He called Jesus over and asked , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
43018034	Jesus answered , “ Are you asking this on your own or did someone tell you about me ? ”
43018035	“ You know I'm not a Jew ! ” Pilate said . “ Your own people and the chief priests brought you to me . What have you done ? ”
43018036	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom doesn't belong to this world . If it did , my followers would have fought to keep me from being handed over to our leaders . No , my kingdom doesn't belong to this world . ”
43018037	“ So you are a king , ” Pilate replied . “ You are saying that I am a king , ” Jesus told him . “ I was born into this world to tell about the truth . And everyone who belongs to the truth knows my voice . ”
43018038	Pilate asked Jesus , “ What is truth ? ” Pilate went back out and said , “ I don't find this man guilty of anything !
43018039	And since I usually set a prisoner free for you at Passover , would you like for me to set free the king of the Jews ? ”
43018040	They shouted , “ No , not him ! We want Barabbas . ” Now Barabbas was a terrorist .
43019001	Pilate gave orders for Jesus to be beaten with a whip .
43019002	The soldiers made a crown out of thorn branches and put it on Jesus . Then they put a purple robe on him .
43019003	They came up to him and said , “ Hey , you king of the Jews ! ” They also hit him with their fists .
43019004	Once again Pilate went out . This time he said , “ I will have Jesus brought out to you again . Then you can see for yourselves that I have not found him guilty . ”
43019005	Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said , “ Here is the man ! ”
43019006	When the chief priests and the temple police saw him , they yelled , “ Nail him to a cross ! Nail him to a cross ! ” Pilate told them , “ You take him and nail him to a cross ! I don't find him guilty of anything . ”
43019007	The crowd replied , “ He claimed to be the Son of God ! Our law says that he must be put to death . ”
43019008	When Pilate heard this , he was terrified .
43019009	He went back inside and asked Jesus , “ Where are you from ? ” But Jesus did not answer .
43019010	“ Why won't you answer my question ? ” Pilate asked . “ Don't you know I have the power to let you go free or to nail you to a cross ? ”
43019011	Jesus replied , “ If God had not given you the power , you couldn't do anything at all to me . But the one who handed me over to you did something even worse . ”
43019012	Then Pilate wanted to set Jesus free . But the crowd again yelled , “ If you set this man free , you are no friend of the Emperor ! Anyone who claims to be a king is an enemy of the Emperor . ”
43019013	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out . Then he sat down on the judge's bench at the place known as “ The Stone Pavement . ” In Aramaic this pavement is called “ Gabbatha . ”
43019014	It was about noon on the day before Passover , and Pilate said to the crowd , “ Look at your king ! ”
43019015	“ Kill him ! Kill him ! ” they yelled . “ Nail him to a cross ! ” “ So you want me to nail your king to a cross ? ” Pilate asked . The chief priests replied , “ The Emperor is our king ! ”
43019016	Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be nailed to a cross . Jesus was taken away ,
43019017	and he carried his cross to a place known as “ The Skull . ” In Aramaic this place is called “ Golgotha . ”
43019018	There Jesus was nailed to the cross , and on each side of him a man was also nailed to a cross .
43019019	Pilate ordered the charge against Jesus to be written on a board and put above the cross . It read , “ Jesus of Nazareth , King of the Jews . ”
43019020	The words were written in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek . The place where Jesus was taken wasn't far from the city , and many of the people read the charge against him .
43019021	So the chief priests went to Pilate and said , “ Why did you write that he is King of the Jews ? You should have written , ‘ He claimed to be King of the Jews . ’ ”
43019022	But Pilate told them , “ What is written will not be changed ! ”
43019023	After the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross , they divided up his clothes into four parts , one for each of them . But his outer garment was made from a single piece of cloth , and it did not have any seams .
43019024	The soldiers said to each other , “ Let's not rip it apart . We will gamble to see who gets it . ” This happened so the Scriptures would come true , which say , “ They divided up my clothes and gambled for my garments . ”
43019025	Jesus' mother stood beside his cross with her sister and Mary the wife of Clopas . Mary Magdalene was standing there too .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother and his favorite disciple with her , he said to his mother , “ This man is now your son . ”
43019027	Then he said to the disciple , “ She is now your mother . ” From then on , that disciple took her into his own home .
43019028	Jesus knew that he had now finished his work . And in order to make the Scriptures come true , he said , “ I am thirsty ! ”
43019029	A jar of cheap wine was there . Someone then soaked a sponge with the wine and held it up to Jesus' mouth on the stem of a hyssop plant .
43019030	After Jesus drank the wine , he said , “ Everything is done ! ” He bowed his head and died .
43019031	The next day would be both a Sabbath and the Passover . It was a special day for the Jewish people , and they did not want the bodies to stay on the crosses during this day . So they asked Pilate to break the men's legs and take their bodies down .
43019032	The soldiers first broke the legs of the other two men who were nailed there .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus , they saw he was already dead , and they did not break his legs .
43019034	One of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus' side , and blood and water came out .
43019035	We know this is true , because it was told by someone who saw it happen . Now you can have faith too .
43019036	All this happened so that the Scriptures would come true , which say , “ No bone of his body will be broken ”
43019037	and “ They will see the one in whose side they stuck a spear . ”
43019038	Joseph from Arimathea was one of Jesus' disciples . He had kept it secret though , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . But now he asked Pilate to let him have Jesus' body . Pilate gave him permission , and Joseph took it down from the cross .
43019039	Nicodemus also came with about 30 kilograms of spices made from myrrh and aloes . This was the same Nicodemus who had visited Jesus one night .
43019040	The two men wrapped the body in a linen cloth , together with the spices , which was how the Jewish people buried their dead .
43019041	In the place where Jesus had been nailed to a cross , there was a garden with a tomb that had never been used .
43019042	The tomb was nearby , and since it was the time to prepare for the Sabbath , they were in a hurry to put Jesus' body there .
43020001	On Sunday morning while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance .
43020002	She ran to Simon Peter and to Jesus' favorite disciple and said , “ They have taken the Lord from the tomb ! We don't know where they have put him . ”
43020003	Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb .
43020004	They ran side by side , until the other disciple ran faster than Peter and got there first .
43020005	He bent over and saw the strips of linen cloth lying inside the tomb , but he did not go in .
43020006	When Simon Peter got there , he went into the tomb and saw the strips of cloth .
43020007	He also saw the piece of cloth that had been used to cover Jesus' face . It was rolled up and in a place by itself .
43020008	The disciple who got there first then went into the tomb , and when he saw it , he believed .
43020009	At that time Peter and the other disciple did not know that the Scriptures said Jesus would rise to life .
43020010	So the two of them went back to the other disciples .
43020011	Mary Magdalene stood crying outside the tomb . She was still weeping , when she stooped down
43020012	and saw two angels inside . They were dressed in white and were sitting where Jesus' body had been . One was at the head and the other was at the foot .
43020013	The angels asked Mary , “ Why are you crying ? ” She answered , “ They have taken away my Lord's body ! I don't know where they have put him . ”
43020014	As soon as Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there . But she did not know who he was .
43020015	Jesus asked her , “ Why are you crying ? Who are you looking for ? ” She thought he was the gardener and said , “ Sir , if you have taken his body away , please tell me , so I can go and get him . ”
43020016	Then Jesus said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned and said to him , “ Rabboni . ” The Aramaic word “ Rabboni ” means “ Teacher . ”
43020017	Jesus told her , “ Don't hold on to me ! I have not yet gone to the Father . But tell my disciples I am going to the one who is my Father and my God , as well as your Father and your God . ”
43020018	Mary Magdalene then went and told the disciples she had seen the Lord . She also told them what he had said to her .
43020019	The disciples were afraid of the Jewish leaders , and on the evening of that same Sunday they locked themselves in a room . Suddenly , Jesus appeared in the middle of the group . He greeted them
43020020	and showed them his hands and his side . When the disciples saw the Lord , they became very happy .
43020021	After Jesus had greeted them again , he said , “ I am sending you , just as the Father has sent me . ”
43020022	Then he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive anyone's sins , they will be forgiven . But if you don't forgive their sins , they will not be forgiven . ”
43020024	Although Thomas the Twin was one of the twelve disciples , he wasn't with the others when Jesus appeared to them .
43020025	So they told him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But Thomas said , “ First , I must see the nail scars in his hands and touch them with my finger . I must put my hand where the spear went into his side . I won't believe unless I do this ! ”
43020026	A week later the disciples were together again . This time , Thomas was with them . Jesus came in while the doors were still locked and stood in the middle of the group . He greeted his disciples
43020027	and said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here and look at my hands ! Put your hand into my side . Stop doubting and have faith ! ”
43020028	Thomas replied , “ You are my Lord and my God ! ”
43020029	Jesus said , “ Thomas , do you have faith because you have seen me ? The people who have faith in me without seeing me are the ones who are really blessed ! ”
43020030	Jesus worked many other miracles for his disciples , and not all of them are written in this book .
43020031	But these are written so that you will put your faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God . If you have faith in him , you will have true life .
43021001	Jesus later appeared to his disciples along the shore of Lake Tiberias .
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas the Twin , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , and the brothers James and John , were there , together with two other disciples .
43021003	Simon Peter said , “ I'm going fishing ! ” The others said , “ We will go with you . ” They went out in their boat . But they didn't catch a thing that night .
43021004	Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples did not realize who he was .
43021005	Jesus shouted , “ Friends , have you caught anything ? ” “ No ! ” they answered .
43021006	So he told them , “ Let your net down on the right side of your boat , and you will catch some fish . ” They did , and the net was so full of fish that they could not drag it up into the boat .
43021007	Jesus' favorite disciple told Peter , “ It's the Lord ! ” When Simon heard it was the Lord , he put on the clothes he had taken off while he was working . Then he jumped into the water .
43021008	The boat was only about 100 meters from shore . So the other disciples stayed in the boat and dragged in the net full of fish .
43021009	When the disciples got out of the boat , they saw some bread and a charcoal fire with fish on it .
43021010	Jesus told his disciples , “ Bring some of the fish you just caught . ”
43021011	Simon Peter got back into the boat and dragged the net to shore . In it were 153 large fish , but still the net did not rip .
43021012	Jesus said , “ Come and eat ! ” But none of the disciples dared ask who he was . They knew he was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus took the bread in his hands and gave some of it to his disciples . He did the same with the fish .
43021014	This was the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from death .
43021015	When Jesus and his disciples had finished eating , he asked , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than the others do ? ” Simon Peter answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know I do ! ” “ Then feed my lambs , ” Jesus said .
43021016	Jesus asked a second time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter answered , “ Yes , Lord , you know I love you ! ” “ Then take care of my sheep , ” Jesus told him .
43021017	Jesus asked a third time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him three times if he loved him . So he told Jesus , “ Lord , you know everything . You know I love you . ” Jesus replied , “ Feed my sheep .
43021018	I tell you for certain that when you were a young man , you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go . But when you are old , you will hold out your hands . Then others will wrap your belt around you and lead you where you don't want to go . ”
43021019	Jesus said this to tell how Peter would die and bring honor to God . Then he said to Peter , “ Follow me ! ”
43021020	Peter turned and saw Jesus' favorite disciple following them . He was the same one who had sat next to Jesus at the meal and had asked , “ Lord , who is going to betray you ? ”
43021021	When Peter saw this disciple , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
43021022	Jesus answered , “ What is it to you , if I want him to live until I return ? You must follow me . ”
43021023	So the rumor spread among the other disciples that this disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He simply said , “ What is it to you , if I want him to live until I return ? ”
43021024	This disciple is the one who told all of this . He wrote it , and we know he is telling the truth .
43021025	Jesus did many other things . If they were all written in books , I don't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books .
44001001	Theophilus , I first wrote to you about all that Jesus did and taught from the very first
44001002	until he was taken up to heaven . But before he was taken up , he gave orders to the apostles he had chosen with the help of the Holy Spirit .
44001003	For 40 days after Jesus had suffered and died , he proved in many ways that he had been raised from death . He appeared to his apostles and spoke to them about God's kingdom .
44001004	While he was still with them , he said :
44001006	While the apostles were still with Jesus , they asked him , “ Lord , are you now going to give Israel its own king again ? ”
44001007	Jesus said to them , “ You don't need to know the time of those events that only the Father controls .
44001008	But the Holy Spirit will come upon you and give you power . Then you will tell everyone about me in Jerusalem , in all Judea , in Samaria , and everywhere in the world . ”
44001009	After Jesus had said this and while they were watching , he was taken up into a cloud . They could not see him ,
44001010	but as he went up , they kept looking up into the sky . Suddenly two men dressed in white clothes were standing there beside them .
44001011	They said , “ Why are you men from Galilee standing here and looking up into the sky ? Jesus has been taken to heaven . But he will come back in the same way you have seen him go . ”
44001014	The apostles often met together and prayed with a single purpose in mind . The women and Mary the mother of Jesus would meet with them , and so would his brothers .
44001015	One day there were about 120 of the Lord's followers meeting together , and Peter stood up to speak to them .
44001023	Two men were suggested : One of them was Joseph Barsabbas , known as Justus , and the other was Matthias .
44001024	Then they all prayed , “ Lord , you know what everyone is like ! Show us the one you have chosen
44001025	to be an apostle and to serve in place of Judas , who got what he deserved . ”
44001026	They drew names , and Matthias was chosen to join the group of the eleven apostles .
44002001	On the day of Pentecost all the Lord's followers were together in one place .
44002002	Suddenly there was a noise from heaven like the sound of a mighty wind ! It filled the house where they were meeting .
44002003	Then they saw what looked like fiery tongues moving in all directions , and a tongue came and settled on each person there .
44002004	The Holy Spirit took control of everyone , and they began speaking whatever languages the Spirit let them speak .
44002005	Many religious Jews from every country in the world were living in Jerusalem .
44002006	And when they heard this noise , a crowd gathered . But they were surprised , because they were hearing everything in their own languages .
44002007	They were excited and amazed , and said :
44002012	Everyone was excited and confused . Some of them even kept asking each other , “ What does all this mean ? ”
44002013	Others made fun of the Lord's followers and said , “ They are drunk . ”
44002014	Peter stood with the eleven apostles and spoke in a loud and clear voice to the crowd :
44002017	“ When the last days come , I will give my Spirit to everyone . Your sons and daughters will prophesy . Your young men will see visions , and your old men will have dreams .
44002018	In those days I will give my Spirit to my servants , both men and women , and they will prophesy .
44002019	I will work miracles in the sky above and wonders on the earth below . There will be blood and fire and clouds of smoke .
44002020	The sun will turn dark , and the moon will be as red as blood before the great and wonderful day of the Lord appears .
44002021	Then the Lord will save everyone who asks for his help . ” “ I always see the Lord near me , and I will not be afraid with him at my right side .
44002026	Because of this , my heart will be glad , my words will be joyful , and I will live in hope .
44002027	The Lord won't leave me in the grave . I am his holy one , and he won't let my body decay .
44002028	He has shown me the path to life , and he makes me glad by being near me . ”
44002037	When the people heard this , they were very upset . They asked Peter and the other apostles , “ Friends , what should we do ? ”
44002038	Peter said to them , “ Turn to God and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
44002039	This promise is for you and your children . It is for everyone our Lord God will choose , no matter where they live . ”
44002040	Peter told them many other things as well . Then he said , “ I beg you to save yourselves from what will happen to all these evil people . ”
44002041	On that day about 3,000 believed his message and were baptized .
44002042	They spent their time learning from the apostles , and they were like family to each other . They also broke bread and prayed together .
44002043	Everyone was amazed by the many miracles and wonders that the apostles worked .
44002044	All the Lord's followers often met together , and they shared everything they had .
44002045	They would sell their property and possessions and give the money to whoever was in need .
44002046	Day after day they met together in the temple . They broke bread together in different homes and shared their food happily and freely ,
44002047	while praising God . Everyone liked them , and each day the Lord added to their group others who were being saved .
44003001	The time of prayer was about three o'clock in the afternoon , and Peter and John were going into the temple .
44003002	A man who had been born lame was being carried to the temple door . Each day he was placed beside this door , known as the Beautiful Gate . He sat there and begged from the people who were going in .
44003003	The man saw Peter and John entering the temple , and he asked them for money .
44003004	But they looked straight at him and said , “ Look up at us ! ”
44003005	The man stared at them and thought he was going to get something .
44003006	But Peter said , “ I don't have any silver or gold ! But I will give you what I do have . In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth , get up and start walking . ”
44003007	Peter then took him by the right hand and helped him up . At once the man's feet and ankles became strong ,
44003008	and he jumped up and started walking . He went with Peter and John into the temple , walking and jumping and praising God .
44003009	Everyone saw him walking around and praising God .
44003010	They knew he was the beggar who had been lying beside the Beautiful Gate , and they were completely surprised . They could not imagine what had happened to the man .
44003011	While the man kept holding on to Peter and John , the whole crowd ran to them in amazement at the place known as Solomon's Porch .
44003012	Peter saw that a crowd had gathered , and he said :
44004001	The apostles were still talking to the people , when some priests , the captain of the temple guard , and some Sadducees arrived .
44004002	These men were angry because the apostles were teaching the people that the dead would be raised from death , just as Jesus had been raised from death .
44004003	It was already late in the afternoon , and they arrested Peter and John and put them in jail for the night .
44004004	But a lot of people who had heard the message believed it . So by now there were about 5,000 followers of the Lord .
44004005	The next morning the leaders , the elders , and the teachers of the Law of Moses met in Jerusalem .
44004006	The high priest Annas was there , as well as Caiaphas , John , Alexander , and other members of the high priest's family .
44004007	They brought in Peter and John and made them stand in the middle while they questioned them . They asked , “ By what power and in whose name have you done this ? ”
44004008	Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and told the nation's leaders and the elders :
44004013	The officials were amazed to see how brave Peter and John were , and they knew that these two apostles were only ordinary men and not well educated . The officials were certain these men had been with Jesus .
44004014	But they could not deny what had happened . The man who had been healed was standing there with the apostles .
44004015	The officials commanded them to leave the council room . Then the officials said to each other ,
44004016	“ What can we do with these men ? Everyone in Jerusalem knows about this miracle , and we cannot say it didn't happen .
44004017	But to keep this thing from spreading , we will warn them never again to speak to anyone about the name of Jesus . ”
44004018	So they called the two apostles back in and told them they must never , for any reason , teach anything about the name of Jesus .
44004019	Peter and John answered , “ Do you think God wants us to obey you or to obey him ?
44004020	We cannot keep quiet about what we have seen and heard . ”
44004023	As soon as Peter and John had been set free , they went back and told the others everything the chief priests and the leaders had said to them .
44004024	When the rest of the Lord's followers heard this , they prayed together and said : “ Why are all the Gentiles so furious ? Why do people make foolish plans ?
44004026	The kings of earth prepare for war , and the rulers join together against the Lord and his Messiah . ”
44004031	After they had prayed , the meeting place shook . They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and bravely spoke God's message .
44004032	The group of followers all felt the same way about everything . None of them claimed that their possessions were their own , and they shared everything they had with each other .
44004033	In a powerful way the apostles told everyone that the Lord Jesus was now alive . God greatly blessed his followers ,
44004034	and no one went in need of anything . Everyone who owned land or houses would sell them and bring the money
44004035	to the apostles . Then they would give the money to anyone in need .
44005001	Ananias and his wife Sapphira also sold a piece of property .
44005002	But they agreed to cheat and keep some of the money for themselves . So when Ananias took the rest of the money to the apostles ,
44005003	Peter said , “ Why has Satan made you keep back some of the money from the sale of the property ? Why have you lied to the Holy Spirit ?
44005004	The property was yours before you sold it , and even after you sold it , the money was still yours . What made you do such a thing ? You didn't lie to people . You lied to God ! ”
44005005	As soon as Ananias heard this , he dropped dead , and everyone who heard about it was frightened .
44005006	Some young men came in and wrapped up his body . Then they took it out and buried it .
44005007	Three hours later Sapphira came in , but she did not know what had happened to her husband .
44005008	Peter asked her , “ Tell me , did you sell the property for this amount ? ” “ Yes , ” she answered , “ that's the amount . ”
44005009	Then Peter said , “ Why did the two of you agree to test the Lord's Spirit ? The men who buried Ananias are by the door , and they will carry you out ! ”
44005010	At once she fell at Peter's feet and died . When the young men came back in , they found Sapphira lying there dead . So they carried her out and buried her beside her husband .
44005011	The church members were afraid , and so was everyone else who heard what had happened .
44005012	The apostles worked many miracles and wonders among the people . All of the Lord's followers often met in the part of the temple known as Solomon's Porch .
44005013	No one outside their group dared join them , even though everyone liked them very much .
44005014	Many men and women started having faith in the Lord .
44005015	Then sick people were brought out to the road and placed on mats . It was hoped that Peter would walk by , and his shadow would fall on them and heal them .
44005016	A lot of people living in the towns near Jerusalem brought those who were sick or troubled by evil spirits , and they were all healed .
44005017	The high priest and all the other Sadducees who were with him became jealous .
44005018	They arrested the apostles and put them in the city jail .
44005019	But that night an angel from the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led the apostles out . The angel said ,
44005020	“ Go to the temple and tell the people everything about this new life . ”
44005021	So they went into the temple before sunrise and started teaching . The high priest and his men called together their council , which included all of Israel's leaders . Then they ordered the apostles to be brought to them from the jail .
44005022	The temple police who were sent to the jail did not find the apostles . They returned and said ,
44005023	“ We found the jail locked tight and the guards standing at the doors . But when we opened the doors and went in , we didn't find anyone there . ”
44005024	The captain of the temple police and the chief priests listened to their report , but they did not know what to think about it .
44005025	Just then someone came in and said , “ Now those men you put in jail are in the temple , teaching the people ! ”
44005026	The captain went with some of the temple police and brought the apostles back . But they did not use force . They were afraid that the people might start throwing stones at them .
44005027	When the apostles were brought before the council , the high priest said to them ,
44005028	“ We told you plainly not to teach in the name of Jesus . But look what you have done ! You have been teaching all over Jerusalem , and you are trying to blame us for his death . ”
44005029	Peter and the apostles replied :
44005033	When the council members heard this , they became so angry they wanted to kill the apostles .
44005034	But one of the members was the Pharisee Gamaliel , a highly respected teacher . He ordered the apostles to be taken out of the room for a little while .
44005035	Then he said to the council : The council members agreed with what he said ,
44005040	and they called the apostles back in . They had them beaten with a whip and warned them not to speak in the name of Jesus . Then they let them go .
44005041	The apostles left the council and were happy , because God had considered them worthy to suffer for the sake of Jesus .
44005042	Every day they spent time in the temple and in one home after another . They never stopped teaching and telling the good news that Jesus is the Messiah .
44006001	A lot of people were now becoming followers of the Lord . But some of the ones who spoke Greek started complaining about the ones who spoke Aramaic . They complained that the Greek-speaking widows were not given their share when the food supplies were handed out each day .
44006002	The twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together and said , “ We should not give up preaching God's message in order to serve at tables .
44006003	My friends , choose seven men who are respected and wise and filled with God's Spirit . We will put them in charge of these things .
44006004	We can spend our time praying and serving God by preaching . ”
44006005	This suggestion pleased everyone , and they began by choosing Stephen . He had great faith and was filled with the Holy Spirit . Then they chose Philip , Prochorus , Nicanor , Timon , Parmenas , and also Nicolaus , who worshiped with the Jewish people in Antioch .
44006006	These men were brought to the apostles . Then the apostles prayed and placed their hands on the men to show they had been chosen to do this work .
44006007	God's message spread , and many more people in Jerusalem became followers . Even a large number of priests put their faith in the Lord .
44006008	God gave Stephen the power to work great miracles and wonders among the people .
44006009	But some men from Cyrene and Alexandria were members of a group who called themselves “ Free Men . ” They started arguing with Stephen . Some others from Cilicia and Asia also argued with him .
44006010	But they were no match for Stephen , who spoke with the great wisdom that the Spirit gave him .
44006011	So they talked some men into saying , “ We heard Stephen say terrible things against Moses and God ! ”
44006012	They turned the people and their leaders and the teachers of the Law of Moses against Stephen . Then they all grabbed him and dragged him in front of the council .
44006013	Some men agreed to tell lies about Stephen , and they said , “ This man keeps on saying terrible things about this holy temple and the Law of Moses .
44006014	We have heard him claim that Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses gave us . ”
44006015	Then all the council members stared at Stephen . They saw that his face looked like the face of an angel .
44007001	The high priest asked Stephen , “ Are they telling the truth about you ? ”
44007002	Stephen answered :
44007049	“ Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool . What kind of house will you build for me ? In what place will I rest ?
44007050	I have made everything . ”
44007054	When the council members heard Stephen's speech , they were angry and furious .
44007055	But Stephen was filled with the Holy Spirit . He looked toward heaven , where he saw our glorious God and Jesus standing at his right side .
44007056	Then Stephen said , “ I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right side of God ! ”
44007057	The council members shouted and covered their ears . At once they all attacked Stephen
44007058	and dragged him out of the city . Then they started throwing stones at him . The men who had brought charges against him put their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul .
44007059	As Stephen was being stoned to death , he called out , “ Lord Jesus , please welcome me ! ”
44007060	He knelt down and shouted , “ Lord , don't blame them for what they have done . ” Then he died .
44008003	Saul started making a lot of trouble for the church . He went from house to house , arresting men and women and putting them in jail .
44008004	The Lord's followers who had been scattered went from place to place , telling the good news .
44008005	Philip went to the city of Samaria and told the people about Christ .
44008006	They crowded around Philip because they were eager to hear what he was saying and to see him work miracles .
44008007	Many people with evil spirits were healed , and the spirits went out of them with a shout . A lot of paralyzed and lame people were also healed .
44008008	Everyone in that city was very glad because of what was happening .
44008009	For some time a man named Simon had lived there and had amazed the people of Samaria . He practiced witchcraft and claimed to be somebody great .
44008010	Everyone , rich and poor , crowded around him . They said , “ This man is the power of God called ‘ The Great Power . ’ ”
44008011	For a long time , Simon had used witchcraft to amaze the people , and they kept crowding around him .
44008012	But when they believed what Philip was saying about God's kingdom and about the name of Jesus Christ , they were all baptized .
44008013	Even Simon believed and was baptized . He stayed close to Philip , because he marveled at all the miracles and wonders .
44008014	The apostles in Jerusalem heard that some people in Samaria had accepted God's message , and they sent Peter and John .
44008015	When the two apostles arrived , they prayed that these people would be given the Holy Spirit .
44008016	Before this , the Holy Spirit had not been given to any of them , though some of them had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44008017	Peter and John then placed their hands on everyone who had faith in the Lord , and they were given the Holy Spirit .
44008018	Simon noticed that the Spirit was given only when the apostles placed their hands on the people . So he brought money
44008019	and said to Peter and John , “ Let me have this power too ! Then anyone I place my hands on will also be given the Holy Spirit . ”
44008020	Peter said to him , “ You and your money will both end up in hell if you think you can buy God's gift !
44008021	You don't have any part in this , and God sees that your heart isn't right .
44008022	Get rid of these evil thoughts and ask God to forgive you .
44008023	I can see that you are jealous and bound by your evil ways . ”
44008024	Simon said , “ Please pray to the Lord , so that what you said won't happen to me . ”
44008025	After Peter and John had preached about the Lord , they returned to Jerusalem . On their way they told the good news in many villages of Samaria .
44008026	The Lord's angel said to Philip , “ Go south along the desert road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza . ”
44008027	So Philip left . An important Ethiopian official happened to be going along that road in his chariot . He was the chief treasurer for Candace , the Queen of Ethiopia . The official had gone to Jerusalem to worship
44008028	and was now on his way home . He was sitting in his chariot , reading the book of the prophet Isaiah .
44008029	The Spirit told Philip to catch up with the chariot .
44008030	Philip ran up close and heard the man reading aloud from the book of Isaiah . Philip asked him , “ Do you understand what you are reading ? ”
44008031	The official answered , “ How can I understand unless someone helps me ? ” He then invited Philip to come up and sit beside him .
44008032	The man was reading the passage that said , “ He was led like a sheep on its way to be killed . He was silent as a lamb whose wool is being cut off , and he did not say a word .
44008033	He was treated like a nobody and did not receive a fair trial . How can he have children , if his life is snatched away ? ”
44008034	The official said to Philip , “ Tell me , was the prophet talking about himself or about someone else ? ”
44008035	So Philip began at this place in the Scriptures and explained the good news about Jesus .
44008038	He ordered the chariot to stop . Then they both went down into the water , and Philip baptized him .
44008039	After they had come out of the water , the Lord's Spirit took Philip away . The official never saw him again , but he was very happy as he went on his way .
44008040	Philip later appeared in Azotus . He went from town to town , all the way to Caesarea , telling people about Jesus .
44009001	Saul kept on threatening to kill the Lord's followers . He even went to the high priest
44009002	and asked for letters to the leaders of the synagogues in Damascus . He did this because he wanted to arrest and take to Jerusalem any man or woman who had accepted the Lord's Way .
44009003	When Saul had almost reached Damascus , a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around him .
44009004	He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying , “ Saul ! Saul ! Why are you so cruel to me ? ”
44009005	“ Who are you ? ” Saul asked . “ I am Jesus , ” the Lord answered . “ I am the one you are so cruel to .
44009006	Now get up and go into the city , where you will be told what to do . ”
44009007	The men with Saul stood there speechless . They had heard the voice , but they had not seen anyone .
44009008	Saul got up from the ground , and when he opened his eyes , he could not see a thing . Someone then led him by the hand to Damascus ,
44009009	and for three days he was blind and did not eat or drink .
44009010	A follower named Ananias lived in Damascus , and the Lord spoke to him in a vision . Ananias answered , “ Lord , here I am . ”
44009011	The Lord said to him , “ Get up and go to the house of Judas on Straight Street . When you get there , you will find a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus . Saul is praying ,
44009012	and he has seen a vision . He saw a man named Ananias coming to him and putting his hands on him , so he could see again . ”
44009013	Ananias replied , “ Lord , a lot of people have told me about the terrible things this man has done to your followers in Jerusalem .
44009014	Now the chief priests have given him the power to come here and arrest anyone who worships in your name . ”
44009015	The Lord said to Ananias , “ Go ! I have chosen him to tell foreigners , kings , and the people of Israel about me .
44009016	I will show him how much he must suffer for worshiping in my name . ”
44009017	Ananias left and went into the house where Saul was staying . Ananias placed his hands on him and said , “ Saul , the Lord Jesus has sent me . He is the same one who appeared to you along the road . He wants you to be able to see and to be filled with the Holy Spirit . ”
44009018	Suddenly something like fish scales fell from Saul's eyes , and he could see . He got up and was baptized .
44009019	Then he ate and felt much better . For several days Saul stayed with the Lord's followers in Damascus .
44009020	Soon he went to the synagogues and started telling people that Jesus is the Son of God .
44009021	Everyone who heard Saul was amazed and said , “ Isn't this the man who caused so much trouble for those people in Jerusalem who worship in the name of Jesus ? Didn't he come here to arrest them and take them to the chief priests ? ”
44009022	Saul preached with such power that he completely confused the Jewish people in Damascus , as he tried to show them that Jesus is the Messiah .
44009023	Later some of them made plans to kill Saul ,
44009024	but he found out about it . He learned that they were guarding the gates of the city day and night in order to kill him .
44009025	Then one night his followers let him down over the city wall in a large basket .
44009026	When Saul arrived in Jerusalem , he tried to join the followers . But they were all afraid of him , because they did not believe he was a true follower .
44009027	Then Barnabas helped him by taking him to the apostles . He explained how Saul had seen the Lord and how the Lord had spoken to him . Barnabas also said when Saul was in Damascus , he had spoken bravely in the name of Jesus .
44009028	Saul moved about freely with the followers in Jerusalem and told everyone about the Lord .
44009029	He was always arguing with the Jews who spoke Greek , and so they tried to kill him .
44009030	But the followers found out about this and took Saul to Caesarea . From there they sent him to the city of Tarsus .
44009031	The church in Judea , Galilee , and Samaria now had a time of peace and kept on worshiping the Lord . The church became stronger , as the Holy Spirit encouraged it and helped it grow .
44009032	While Peter was traveling from place to place , he visited the Lord's followers who lived in the town of Lydda .
44009033	There he met a man named Aeneas , who for eight years had been sick in bed and could not move .
44009034	Peter said to Aeneas , “ Jesus Christ has healed you ! Get up and make up your bed . ” At once he stood up .
44009035	Many people in the towns of Lydda and Sharon saw Aeneas and became followers of the Lord .
44009036	In Joppa there was a follower named Tabitha . Her Greek name was Dorcas , which means “ deer . ” She was always doing good things for people and had given much to the poor .
44009037	But she got sick and died , and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room .
44009038	Joppa wasn't far from Lydda , and the followers heard that Peter was there . They sent two men to say to him , “ Please come with us as quickly as you can ! ”
44009039	At once , Peter went with them . The men took Peter upstairs into the room . Many widows were there crying . They showed him the coats and clothes that Dorcas had made while she was still alive .
44009040	After Peter had sent everyone out of the room , he knelt down and prayed . Then he turned to the body of Dorcas and said , “ Tabitha , get up ! ” The woman opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
44009041	He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet . Peter called in the widows and the other followers and showed them that Dorcas had been raised from death .
44009042	Everyone in Joppa heard what had happened , and many of them put their faith in the Lord .
44009043	Peter stayed on for a while in Joppa in the house of a man named Simon , who made leather .
44010001	In Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , who was the captain of a group of soldiers called “ The Italian Unit . ”
44010002	Cornelius was a very religious man . He worshiped God , and so did everyone else who lived in his house . He had given a lot of money to the poor and was always praying to God .
44010003	One afternoon at about three o'clock , Cornelius had a vision . He saw an angel from God coming to him and calling him by name .
44010004	Cornelius was surprised and stared at the angel . Then he asked , “ What is this all about ? ” The angel answered , “ God has heard your prayers and knows about your gifts to the poor .
44010005	Now send some men to Joppa for a man named Simon Peter .
44010006	He is staying with Simon the leather maker , who lives in a house near the sea . ”
44010007	After saying this , the angel left . Cornelius called in two of his servants and one of his soldiers who worshiped God .
44010008	He explained everything to them and sent them off to Joppa .
44010009	The next day about noon these men were coming near Joppa . Peter went up on the roof of the house to pray
44010010	and became very hungry . While the food was being prepared , he fell sound asleep and had a vision .
44010011	He saw heaven open , and something came down like a huge sheet held up by its four corners .
44010012	In it were all kinds of animals , reptiles , and birds .
44010013	A voice said to him , “ Peter , get up ! Kill these and eat them . ”
44010014	But Peter said , “ Lord , I can't do that ! I've never eaten anything that is unclean and not fit to eat . ”
44010015	The voice spoke to him again , “ When God says that something can be used for food , don't say it isn't fit to eat . ”
44010016	This happened three times before the sheet was suddenly taken back to heaven .
44010017	Peter was still wondering what all this meant , when the men sent by Cornelius came and stood at the gate . They had found their way to Simon's house
44010018	and were asking if Simon Peter was staying there .
44010019	While Peter was still thinking about the vision , the Holy Spirit said to him , “ Three men are here looking for you .
44010020	Hurry down and go with them . Don't worry , I sent them . ”
44010021	Peter went down and said to the men , “ I am the one you are looking for . Why have you come ? ”
44010022	They answered , “ Captain Cornelius sent us . He is a good man who worships God and is liked by the Jewish people . One of God's holy angels told Cornelius to send for you , so he could hear what you have to say . ”
44010023	Peter invited them to spend the night . The next morning , Peter and some of the Lord's followers in Joppa left with the men who had come from Cornelius .
44010024	The next day they arrived in Caesarea where Cornelius was waiting for them . He had also invited his relatives and close friends .
44010025	When Peter arrived , Cornelius greeted him . Then he knelt at Peter's feet and started worshiping him .
44010026	But Peter took hold of him and said , “ Stand up ! I am nothing more than a human . ”
44010027	As Peter entered the house , he was still talking with Cornelius . Many people were there ,
44010028	and Peter said to them , “ You know that we Jews are not allowed to have anything to do with other people . But God has shown me that he doesn't think anyone is unclean or unfit .
44010029	I agreed to come here , but I want to know why you sent for me . ”
44010030	Cornelius answered :
44010034	Peter then said :
44010044	While Peter was still speaking , the Holy Spirit took control of everyone who was listening .
44010045	Some Jewish followers of the Lord had come with Peter , and they were surprised that the Holy Spirit had been given to Gentiles .
44010046	Now they were hearing Gentiles speaking unknown languages and praising God . Peter said ,
44010047	“ These Gentiles have been given the Holy Spirit , just as we have ! I am certain that no one would dare stop us from baptizing them . ”
44010048	Peter ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ , and they asked him to stay on for a few days .
44011001	The apostles and the followers in Judea heard that Gentiles had accepted God's message .
44011002	So when Peter came to Jerusalem , some of the Jewish followers started arguing with him . They wanted Gentile followers to be circumcised , and
44011003	they said , “ You stayed in the homes of Gentiles , and you even ate with them ! ”
44011004	Then Peter told them exactly what had happened :
44011018	When they heard Peter say this , they stopped arguing and started praising God . They said , “ God has now let Gentiles turn to him , and he has given life to them ! ”
44011019	Some of the Lord's followers had been scattered because of the terrible trouble that started when Stephen was killed . They went as far as Phoenicia , Cyprus , and Antioch , but they told the message only to the Jews .
44011020	Some of the followers from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch and started telling Gentiles the good news about the Lord Jesus .
44011021	The Lord's power was with them , and many people turned to the Lord and put their faith in him .
44011022	News of what was happening reached the church in Jerusalem . Then they sent Barnabas to Antioch .
44011023	When Barnabas got there and saw how God had blessed them with undeserved grace , he was very glad . So he begged them to remain faithful to the Lord with all their hearts .
44011024	Barnabas was a good man of great faith , and he was filled with the Holy Spirit . Many more people turned to the Lord .
44011025	Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul .
44011026	He found Saul and brought him to Antioch , where they met with the church for a whole year and taught many of its people . There in Antioch the Lord's followers were first called Christians .
44011027	During this time some prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch .
44011028	One of them was Agabus . Then with the help of the Spirit , he told that there would be a terrible famine everywhere in the world . And it happened when Claudius was Emperor .
44011029	The followers in Antioch decided to send whatever help they could to the followers in Judea .
44011030	So they appointed Barnabas and Saul to take their gifts to the church leaders in Jerusalem .
44012001	At that time King Herod caused terrible suffering for some members of the church .
44012002	He ordered soldiers to cut off the head of James , the brother of John .
44012003	When Herod saw that this pleased the Jewish people , he had Peter arrested during the Festival of Thin Bread .
44012004	He put Peter in jail and ordered four squads of soldiers to guard him . Herod planned to put him on trial in public after the festival .
44012005	While Peter was being kept in jail , the church never stopped praying to God for him .
44012006	The night before Peter was to be put on trial , he was asleep and bound by two chains . A soldier was guarding him on each side , and two other soldiers were guarding the entrance to the jail .
44012007	Suddenly an angel from the Lord appeared , and light flashed around in the cell . The angel poked Peter in the side and woke him up . Then he said , “ Quick ! Get up ! ” The chains fell off his hands ,
44012008	and the angel said , “ Get dressed and put on your sandals . ” Peter did what he was told . Then the angel said , “ Now put on your coat and follow me . ”
44012009	Peter left with the angel , but he thought everything was only a dream .
44012010	They went past the two groups of soldiers , and when they came to the iron gate to the city , it opened by itself . They went out and were going along the street , when all at once the angel disappeared .
44012011	Peter now realized what had happened , and he said , “ I am certain that the Lord sent his angel to rescue me from Herod and from everything the Jewish leaders planned to do to me . ”
44012012	Then Peter went to the house of Mary the mother of John whose other name was Mark . Many of the Lord's followers had come together there and were praying .
44012013	Peter knocked on the gate , and a servant named Rhoda came to answer .
44012014	When she heard Peter's voice , she was too excited to open the gate . She ran back into the house and said Peter was standing there .
44012015	“ You are crazy ! ” everyone told her . But she kept saying it was Peter . Then they said , “ It must be his angel . ”
44012016	But Peter kept on knocking , until finally they opened the gate . They saw him and were completely amazed .
44012017	Peter motioned for them to keep quiet . Then he told how the Lord had led him out of jail . He also said , “ Tell James and the others what has happened . ” After that , he left and went somewhere else .
44012018	The next morning the soldiers who had been on guard were terribly worried and wondered what had happened to Peter .
44012019	Herod ordered his own soldiers to search for him , but they could not find him . Then he questioned the guards and had them put to death . After this , Herod left Judea to stay in Caesarea for a while .
44012020	Herod and the people of Tyre and Sidon were very angry with each other . But their country got its food supply from the region that he ruled . So a group of them went to see Blastus , who was one of Herod's high officials . They convinced Blastus that they wanted to make peace between their cities and Herod ,
44012021	and a day was set for them to meet with him . Herod came dressed in his royal robes . He sat down on his throne and made a speech .
44012022	The people shouted , “ You speak more like a god than a man ! ”
44012023	At once an angel from the Lord struck him down because he took the honor that belonged to God . Later , Herod was eaten by worms and died .
44012024	God's message kept spreading .
44012025	And after Barnabas and Saul had done the work they were sent to do , they went back to Jerusalem with John , whose other name was Mark .
44013001	The church at Antioch had several prophets and teachers . They were Barnabas , Simeon , also called Niger , Lucius from Cyrene , Manaen , who was Herod's close friend , and Saul .
44013002	While they were worshiping the Lord and going without eating , the Holy Spirit told them , “ Appoint Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have chosen them . ”
44013003	Everyone prayed and went without eating for a while longer . Next , they placed their hands on Barnabas and Saul to show that they had been appointed to do this work . Then everyone sent them on their way .
44013004	After Barnabas and Saul had been sent by the Holy Spirit , they went to Seleucia . From there they sailed to the island of Cyprus .
44013005	They arrived at Salamis and began to preach God's message in the synagogues . They also had John as a helper .
44013006	Barnabas and Saul went all the way to the city of Paphos on the other end of the island , where they met a Jewish man named Bar-Jesus . He practiced witchcraft and was a false prophet .
44013007	He also worked for Sergius Paulus , who was very smart and was the governor of the island . Sergius Paulus wanted to hear God's message , and he sent for Barnabas and Saul .
44013008	But Bar-Jesus , whose other name was Elymas , was against them . He even tried to keep the governor from having faith in the Lord .
44013009	Then Saul , better known as Paul , was filled with the Holy Spirit . He looked straight at Elymas
44013010	and said , “ You son of the devil ! You are a liar , a crook , and an enemy of everything that is right . When will you stop speaking against the true ways of the Lord ?
44013011	The Lord is going to punish you by making you completely blind for a while . ” Suddenly the man's eyes were covered by a dark mist , and he went around trying to get someone to lead him by the hand .
44013012	When the governor saw what had happened , he was amazed at this teaching about the Lord . So he put his faith in the Lord .
44013013	Paul and the others left Paphos and sailed to Perga in Pamphylia . But John left them and went back to Jerusalem .
44013014	The rest of them went on from Perga to Antioch in Pisidia . Then on the Sabbath they went to the synagogue and sat down .
44013015	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets , the leaders sent someone over to tell Paul and Barnabas , “ Friends , if you have anything to say that will help the people , please say it . ”
44013016	Paul got up . He motioned with his hand and said : “ You are my son because today I have become your Father . ” “ I will make to you the same holy promises that I made to David . ”
44013041	“ Look , you people who make fun of God ! Be amazed and disappear . I will do something today that you won't believe , even if someone tells you about it ! ”
44013042	As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue , the people begged them to say more about these same things on the next Sabbath .
44013043	After the service , many Jews and a lot of Gentiles who worshiped God went with them . Paul and Barnabas begged them all to remain faithful to God , who had treated them with undeserved grace .
44013044	The next Sabbath almost everyone in town came to hear the message about the Lord .
44013045	When the Jewish people saw the crowds , they were very jealous . They insulted Paul and spoke against everything he said .
44013046	But Paul and Barnabas bravely said : “ I have placed you here as a light for the Gentiles . You are to take the saving power of God to people everywhere on earth . ”
44013048	This message made the Gentiles glad , and they praised what they had heard about the Lord . Everyone who had been chosen for eternal life then put their faith in the Lord .
44013049	The message about the Lord spread all over this region .
44013050	But the Jewish leaders went to some of the important men in the town and to some respected women who were religious . They turned them against Paul and Barnabas and started making trouble for them . They even chased them out of this part of the country .
44013051	Paul and Barnabas shook the dust from that place off their feet and went on to the city of Iconium .
44013052	But the Lord's followers in Antioch were very happy and were filled with the Holy Spirit .
44014001	Paul and Barnabas spoke in the synagogue in Iconium , just as they had done at Antioch , and many Jews and Gentiles put their faith in the Lord .
44014002	But the Jews who did not have faith in him made the other Gentiles angry and turned them against the Lord's followers .
44014003	Paul and Barnabas stayed there for a while , having faith in the Lord and bravely speaking his message . The Lord gave them the power to work miracles and wonders , and he showed that their message about his gift of undeserved grace was true .
44014004	The people of Iconium did not know what to think . Some of them believed the Jewish group , and others believed the apostles .
44014005	Finally , some Gentiles and Jews , together with their leaders , decided to make trouble for Paul and Barnabas and to stone them to death .
44014008	In Lystra there was a man who had been born with paralyzed feet and had never been able to walk .
44014009	The man was listening to Paul speak , when Paul saw that he had faith in Jesus and could be healed . So he looked straight at the man
44014010	and shouted , “ Stand up ! ” The man jumped up and started walking around .
44014011	When the crowd saw what Paul had done , they yelled out in the language of Lycaonia , “ The gods have turned into humans and have come down to us ! ”
44014012	The people then gave Barnabas the name Zeus , and they gave Paul the name Hermes , because he did the talking .
44014013	The temple of Zeus was near the entrance to the city . Its priest and the crowds wanted to offer a sacrifice to Barnabas and Paul . So the priest brought some bulls and flowers to the city gates .
44014014	When the two apostles found out about this , they tore their clothes in horror and ran to the crowd , shouting :
44014018	Even after Paul and Barnabas had said all this , they could hardly keep the people from offering a sacrifice to them .
44014019	Some Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came and turned the crowds against Paul . They hit him with stones and dragged him out of the city , thinking he was dead .
44014020	But when the Lord's followers gathered around Paul , he stood up and went back into the city . The next day he and Barnabas went to Derbe .
44014021	Paul and Barnabas preached the good news in Derbe and won some people to the Lord . Then they went back to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch in Pisidia .
44014022	They encouraged the followers and begged them to remain faithful . They told them , “ We have to suffer a lot before we can get into God's kingdom . ”
44014023	Paul and Barnabas chose some leaders for each of the churches . Then they went without eating and prayed that the Lord would take good care of these leaders who had trusted in the Lord .
44014024	Paul and Barnabas went on through Pisidia to Pamphylia ,
44014025	where they preached in the town of Perga . Then they went down to Attalia
44014026	and sailed to Antioch in Syria . It was there that they had been placed in God's care for the work they had now completed .
44014027	After arriving in Antioch , they called the church together . They told the people what God had helped them do and how he had made it possible for the Gentiles to believe .
44014028	Then they stayed there with the followers for a long time .
44015001	Some people came from Judea and started teaching the Lord's followers that they could not be saved , unless they were circumcised as Moses had taught .
44015002	This caused trouble , and Paul and Barnabas argued with them about this teaching . So it was decided to send Paul and Barnabas and a few others to Jerusalem to discuss this problem with the apostles and the church leaders .
44015003	The men who were sent by the church went through Phoenicia and Samaria , telling how the Gentiles had turned to God . This news made the Lord's followers very happy .
44015004	When the men arrived in Jerusalem , they were welcomed by the church , including the apostles and the leaders . They told them everything God had helped them do .
44015005	But some Pharisees had become followers of the Lord . They stood up and said , “ Gentiles who have faith in the Lord must be circumcised and told to obey the Law of Moses . ”
44015006	The apostles and church leaders met to discuss this problem about Gentiles .
44015007	They had talked it over for a long time , when Peter got up and said :
44015012	Everyone kept quiet and listened as Barnabas and Paul told how God had given them the power to work a lot of miracles and wonders for the Gentiles .
44015013	After they had finished speaking , James said :
44015016	“ I , the Lord , will return and rebuild David's fallen house . I will build it from its ruins and set it up again .
44015017	Then other nations will turn to me and be my chosen ones . I , the Lord , say this .
44015018	I promised it long ago . ”
44015022	The apostles , the leaders , and all the church members decided to send some men to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas . They chose Silas and Judas Barsabbas , who were two leaders of the Lord's followers .
44015023	They wrote a letter that said :
44015030	The four men left Jerusalem and went to Antioch . Then they called the church members together and gave them the letter .
44015031	When the letter was read , everyone was pleased and greatly encouraged .
44015032	Judas and Silas were prophets , and they spoke a long time , encouraging and helping the Lord's followers .
44015033	The men from Jerusalem stayed on in Antioch for a while . And when they left to return to the ones who had sent them , the followers wished them well .
44015036	Sometime later Paul said to Barnabas , “ Let's go back and visit the Lord's followers in the cities where we preached his message . Then we will know how they are doing . ”
44015037	Barnabas wanted to take along John , whose other name was Mark .
44015038	But Paul did not want to , because Mark had left them in Pamphylia and had stopped working with them .
44015039	Paul and Barnabas argued , then each of them went his own way . Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus ,
44015040	but Paul took Silas and left after the followers had placed them in God's care .
44015041	They traveled through Syria and Cilicia , encouraging the churches .
44016001	Paul and Silas went back to Derbe and Lystra , where there was a follower named Timothy . His mother was also a follower . She was Jewish , and his father was Greek .
44016002	The Lord's followers in Lystra and Iconium said good things about Timothy ,
44016003	and Paul wanted him to go with them . But Paul first had him circumcised , because all the Jewish people around there knew that Timothy's father was Greek .
44016004	As Paul and the others went from city to city , they told the followers what the apostles and leaders in Jerusalem had decided , and they urged them to follow these instructions .
44016005	The churches became stronger in their faith , and each day more people put their faith in the Lord .
44016006	Paul and his friends went through Phrygia and Galatia , but the Holy Spirit would not let them preach in Asia .
44016007	After they arrived in Mysia , they tried to go into Bithynia , but the Spirit of Jesus would not let them .
44016008	So they went on through Mysia until they came to Troas .
44016009	During the night , Paul had a vision of someone from Macedonia who was standing there and begging him , “ Come over to Macedonia and help us ! ”
44016010	After Paul had seen the vision , we began looking for a way to go to Macedonia . We were sure that God had called us to preach the good news there .
44016011	We sailed straight from Troas to Samothrace , and the next day we arrived in Neapolis .
44016012	From there we went to Philippi , which is a Roman colony in the first district of Macedonia . We spent several days in Philippi .
44016013	Then on the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to a place by the river , where we thought there would be a Jewish meeting place for prayer . We sat down and talked with the women who came .
44016014	One of them was Lydia , who was from the city of Thyatira and sold expensive purple cloth . She was a worshiper of the Lord God , and he made her willing to accept what Paul was saying .
44016015	Then after she and her family were baptized , she kept on begging us , “ If you think I really do have faith in the Lord , come stay in my home . ” Finally , we accepted her invitation .
44016016	One day on our way to the place of prayer , we were met by a slave girl . She had a spirit in her that gave her the power to tell the future . By doing this she made a lot of money for her owners .
44016017	The girl followed Paul and the rest of us , and she kept yelling , “ These men are servants of the Most High God ! They are telling you how to be saved . ”
44016018	This went on for several days . Finally , Paul got so upset that he turned and said to the spirit , “ In the name of Jesus Christ , I order you to leave this girl alone ! ” At once the evil spirit left her .
44016019	When the girl's owners realized they had lost all chances for making more money , they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them into court .
44016020	They told the officials , “ These Jews are upsetting our city !
44016021	They are telling us to do things we Romans are not allowed to do . ”
44016022	The crowd joined in the attack on Paul and Silas . Then the officials tore the clothes off the two men and ordered them to be beaten with a whip .
44016023	After they had been badly beaten , they were put in jail , and the jailer was told to guard them carefully .
44016024	The jailer did as he was told . He put them deep inside the jail and chained their feet to heavy blocks of wood .
44016025	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God , while the other prisoners listened .
44016026	Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the jail to its foundations . The doors opened , and the chains fell from all the prisoners .
44016027	When the jailer woke up and saw that the doors were open , he thought that the prisoners had escaped . He pulled out his sword and was about to kill himself .
44016028	But Paul shouted , “ Don't harm yourself ! No one has escaped . ”
44016029	The jailer asked for a torch and went into the jail . He was shaking all over as he knelt down in front of Paul and Silas .
44016030	After he had led them out of the jail , he asked , “ What must I do to be saved ? ”
44016031	They replied , “ Have faith in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved ! This is also true for everyone who lives in your home . ”
44016032	Then Paul and Silas told him and everyone else in his house about the Lord .
44016033	While it was still night , the jailer took them to a place where he could wash their cuts and bruises . Then he and everyone in his home were baptized .
44016034	They were very glad they had put their faith in God . After this , the jailer took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them something to eat .
44016035	The next morning the officials sent some police with orders for the jailer to let Paul and Silas go .
44016036	The jailer told Paul , “ The officials have ordered me to set you free . Now you can leave in peace . ”
44016037	But Paul told the police , “ We are Roman citizens , and the Roman officials had us beaten in public without giving us a trial . They threw us into jail . Now do they think they can secretly send us away ? No , they cannot ! They will have to come here themselves and let us out . ”
44016038	When the police told the officials that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens , the officials were afraid .
44016039	So they came and apologized . They led them out of the jail and asked them to please leave town .
44016040	But Paul and Silas went straight to the home of Lydia , where they saw the Lord's followers and encouraged them . Then they left .
44017001	After Paul and his friends had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they went on to Thessalonica . A synagogue was in that city .
44017002	So as usual , Paul went there to worship , and on three Sabbaths he spoke to the people . He used the Scriptures
44017003	to show them that the Messiah had to suffer , but that he would rise from death . Paul also told them that Jesus is the Messiah he was preaching about .
44017004	Some of them believed what Paul had said , and they became followers with Paul and Silas . Some Gentiles and many important women also believed the message .
44017005	The Jewish leaders were jealous and got some troublemakers who hung around the marketplace to start a riot in the city . They wanted to drag Paul and Silas out to the mob , and so they went straight to Jason's home .
44017006	But when they did not find them there , they dragged out Jason and some of the Lord's followers . They took them to the city authorities and shouted , “ Paul and Silas have been upsetting things everywhere . Now they have come here ,
44017007	and Jason has welcomed them into his home . All of them break the laws of the Roman Emperor by claiming that someone named Jesus is king . ”
44017008	The officials and the people were upset when they heard this .
44017009	So they made Jason and the other followers pay bail before letting them go .
44017010	That same night the Lord's followers sent Paul and Silas on to Berea , and after they arrived , they went to the synagogue .
44017011	The people in Berea were much nicer than those in Thessalonica , and they gladly accepted the message . Day after day they studied the Scriptures to see if these things were true .
44017012	Many of them put their faith in the Lord , including some important Greek women and several men .
44017013	When the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica heard that Paul had been preaching God's message in Berea , they went there and caused trouble by turning the crowds against Paul .
44017014	At once the followers sent Paul down to the coast , but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea .
44017015	Some men went with Paul as far as Athens , and then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible .
44017016	While Paul was waiting in Athens , he was upset to see all the idols in the city .
44017017	He went to the synagogue to speak to the Jews and to anyone who worshiped with them . Day after day he also spoke to everyone he met in the market .
44017018	Some of them were Epicureans and some were Stoics , and they started arguing with him . People were asking , “ What is this know-it-all trying to say ? ” Some even said , “ Paul must be preaching about foreign gods ! That's what he means when he talks about Jesus and about people rising from death . ”
44017019	They brought Paul before a council called the Areopagus , and said , “ Tell us what your new teaching is all about .
44017020	We have heard you say some strange things , and we want to know what you mean . ”
44017021	More than anything else the people of Athens and the foreigners living there loved to hear and to talk about anything new .
44017022	So Paul stood up in front of the council and said :
44017032	As soon as the people heard Paul say a man had been raised from death , some of them started laughing . Others said , “ We will hear you talk about this some other time . ”
44017033	When Paul left the council meeting ,
44017034	some of the men put their faith in the Lord and went with Paul . One of them was a council member named Dionysius . A woman named Damaris and several others also put their faith in the Lord .
44018001	Paul left Athens and went to Corinth ,
44018002	where he met Aquila , a Jewish man from Pontus . Not long before this , Aquila had come from Italy with his wife Priscilla , because Emperor Claudius had ordered the Jewish people to leave Rome . Paul went to see Aquila and Priscilla
44018003	and found out they were tent makers . Paul was also a tent maker , so he stayed with them , and they worked together .
44018004	Every Sabbath , Paul went to the synagogue . He spoke to Jews and Gentiles and tried to win them over .
44018005	But after Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia , he spent all his time preaching to the Jews about Jesus the Messiah .
44018006	Finally , they turned against him and insulted him . So he shook the dust from his clothes and told them , “ Whatever happens to you will be your own fault ! I am not to blame . From now on I am going to preach to the Gentiles . ”
44018007	Paul then moved into the house of a man named Titius Justus , who worshiped God and lived next door to the synagogue .
44018008	Crispus was the leader of the synagogue . He and everyone in his family put their faith in the Lord . Many others in Corinth also heard the message , and all the people who had faith in the Lord were baptized .
44018009	One night , Paul had a vision , and in it the Lord said , “ Don't be afraid to keep on preaching . Don't stop !
44018010	I am with you , and you won't be harmed . Many people in this city belong to me . ”
44018011	Paul stayed on in Corinth for a year and a half , teaching God's message to the people .
44018012	While Gallio was governor of Achaia , some of the Jewish leaders got together and grabbed Paul . They brought him into court
44018013	and said , “ This man is trying to make our people worship God in a way that is against our Law ! ”
44018014	Even before Paul could speak , Gallio said , “ If you were charging this man with a crime or some other wrong , I would have to listen to you .
44018015	But since this concerns only words , names , and your own law , you will have to take care of it yourselves . I refuse to judge such matters . ”
44018016	Then he sent them out of the court .
44018017	The crowd grabbed Sosthenes , the Jewish leader , and beat him up in front of the court . But none of this mattered to Gallio .
44018018	After Paul had stayed for a while with the Lord's followers in Corinth , he told them goodbye and sailed on to Syria with Aquila and Priscilla . But before he left , he had his head shaved at Cenchreae because he had made a promise to God .
44018019	The three of them arrived in Ephesus , where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila . He then went into the synagogue to talk with the people there .
44018020	They asked him to stay longer , but he refused .
44018021	He told them goodbye and said , “ If God lets me , I will come back . ”
44018022	Paul sailed to Caesarea , where he greeted the church . Then he went on to Antioch .
44018023	After staying there for a while , he left and visited several places in Galatia and Phrygia . He helped the followers there to become stronger in their faith .
44018024	A Jewish man named Apollos came to Ephesus . Apollos had been born in the city of Alexandria . He was a very good speaker and knew a lot about the Scriptures .
44018025	He also knew much about the Lord's Way , and he spoke about it with great excitement . What he taught about Jesus was right , but all he knew was John's message about baptism .
44018026	Apollos started speaking bravely in the synagogue . But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him , they took him to their home and helped him understand God's Way even better .
44018027	Apollos decided to travel through Achaia . So the Lord's followers wrote letters , encouraging the followers there to welcome him . After Apollos arrived in Achaia , he was a great help to everyone who had put their faith in the Lord Jesus because of God's gift of undeserved grace .
44018028	He got into fierce arguments with the Jewish people , and in public he used the Scriptures to prove that Jesus is the Messiah .
44019001	While Apollos was in Corinth , Paul traveled across the hill country to Ephesus , where he met some of the Lord's followers .
44019002	He asked them , “ When you put your faith in Jesus , were you given the Holy Spirit ? ” “ No ! ” they answered . “ We have never even heard of the Holy Spirit . ”
44019003	“ Then why were you baptized ? ” Paul asked . They answered , “ Because of what John taught . ”
44019004	Paul replied , “ John baptized people so they would turn to God . But he also told them someone else was coming , and they should put their faith in him . Jesus is the one that John was talking about . ”
44019005	After the people heard Paul say this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019006	Then Paul placed his hands on them . The Holy Spirit was given to them , and they spoke unknown languages and prophesied .
44019007	There were about twelve men in this group .
44019008	For three months Paul went to the synagogue and talked bravely with the people about God's kingdom . He tried to win them over ,
44019009	but some of them were stubborn and refused to believe . In front of everyone they said terrible things about God's Way . Paul left and took the followers with him to the lecture hall of Tyrannus . He spoke there every day
44019010	for two years , until every Jew and Gentile in Asia had heard the Lord's message .
44019011	God gave Paul the power to work great miracles .
44019012	People even took handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched Paul's body , and they carried them to everyone who was sick . All of the sick people were healed , and the evil spirits went out .
44019013	Some Jewish men started going around trying to force out evil spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus . They said to the spirits , “ Come out in the name of that same Jesus that Paul preaches about ! ”
44019014	Seven sons of a high priest named Sceva were doing this ,
44019015	when an evil spirit said to them , “ I know Jesus ! And I have heard about Paul . But who are you ? ”
44019016	Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them up . They ran out of the house , naked and bruised .
44019017	When the Jews and Gentiles in Ephesus heard about this , they were so frightened that they praised the name of the Lord Jesus .
44019018	Many who were followers now started telling everyone about the evil things they had been doing .
44019019	Some who had been practicing witchcraft even brought their books and burned them in public . These books were worth about 50,000 silver coins .
44019020	So the Lord's message spread and became even more powerful .
44019021	After all this had happened , Paul decided to visit Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem . Paul had said , “ From there I will go on to Rome . ”
44019022	So he sent his two helpers , Timothy and Erastus , to Macedonia . But he stayed on in Asia for a while .
44019023	At that time there was serious trouble because of the Lord's Way .
44019024	A silversmith named Demetrius had a business that made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis . Those who worked for him earned a lot of money .
44019025	Demetrius brought together everyone who was in the same business and said :
44019028	When the workers heard this , they got angry and started shouting , “ Great is Artemis , the goddess of the Ephesians ! ”
44019029	Soon the whole city was in a riot , and some men grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , who had come from Macedonia with Paul . Then everyone in the crowd rushed to the place where the town meetings were held .
44019030	Paul wanted to go out and speak to the people , but the Lord's followers would not let him .
44019031	A few of the local officials were friendly to Paul , and they sent someone to warn him not to go .
44019032	Some of the people in the meeting were shouting one thing , and others were shouting something else . Everyone was completely confused , and most of them did not even know why they were there .
44019033	Several of the Jewish leaders pushed a man named Alexander to the front of the crowd and started telling him what to say . He motioned with his hand and tried to explain what was going on .
44019034	But when the crowd saw that he was Jewish , they all shouted for two hours , “ Great is Artemis , the goddess of the Ephesians ! ”
44019035	Finally , a town official made the crowd be quiet . Then he said :
44019041	After saying this , he told the people to leave .
44020001	When the riot was over , Paul sent for the followers and encouraged them . He then told them goodbye and left for Macedonia .
44020002	As he traveled from place to place , he encouraged the followers with many messages . Finally , he went to Greece
44020003	and stayed there for three months . Paul was about to sail to Syria . But some of the Jewish leaders plotted against him , so he decided to return by way of Macedonia .
44020004	With him were Sopater , son of Pyrrhus from Berea , and Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica . Gaius from Derbe was also with him , and so were Timothy and the two Asians , Tychicus and Trophimus .
44020005	They went on ahead to Troas and waited for us there .
44020006	After the Festival of Thin Bread , we sailed from Philippi . Five days later we met them in Troas and stayed there for a week .
44020007	On the first day of the week we met to break bread together . Paul spoke to the people until midnight because he was leaving the next morning .
44020008	In the upstairs room where we were meeting , there were a lot of lamps .
44020009	A young man by the name of Eutychus was sitting on a window sill . While Paul was speaking , the young man got very sleepy . Finally , he went to sleep and fell three floors all the way down to the ground . When they picked him up , he was dead .
44020010	Paul went down and bent over Eutychus . He took him in his arms and said , “ Don't worry ! He's alive . ”
44020011	After Paul had gone back upstairs , he broke bread , and ate with us . He then spoke until dawn and left .
44020012	Then the followers took the young man home alive and were very happy .
44020013	Paul decided to travel by land to Assos . The rest of us went on ahead by ship , and we were to take him aboard there .
44020014	When he met us in Assos , he came aboard , and we sailed on to Mitylene .
44020015	The next day we came to a place near Chios , and the following day we reached Samos . The day after that we sailed to Miletus .
44020016	Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus , because he did not want to spend too much time in Asia . He was in a hurry and wanted to be in Jerusalem in time for Pentecost .
44020017	From Miletus , Paul sent a message for the church leaders at Ephesus to come and meet with him .
44020018	When they got there , he said :
44020036	After Paul had finished speaking , he knelt down with all of them and prayed .
44020037	Everyone cried and hugged and kissed him .
44020038	They were especially sad because Paul had told them , “ You will never see me again . ” Then they went with him to the ship .
44021001	After saying goodbye , we sailed straight to Cos . The next day we reached Rhodes and from there sailed on to Patara .
44021002	We found a ship going to Phoenicia , so we got on board and sailed off .
44021003	We came within sight of Cyprus and then sailed south of it on to the port of Tyre in Syria , where the ship was going to unload its cargo .
44021004	We found the Lord's followers and stayed with them for a week . The Holy Spirit had told them to warn Paul not to go on to Jerusalem .
44021005	But when the week was over , we started on our way again . All the men , together with their wives and children , walked with us from the town to the seashore . We knelt on the beach and prayed .
44021006	Then after saying goodbye to each other , we got into the ship , and they went back home .
44021007	We sailed from Tyre to Ptolemais , where we greeted the followers and stayed with them for a day .
44021008	The next day we went to Caesarea and stayed with Philip , the preacher . He was one of the seven men who helped the apostles ,
44021009	and he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied .
44021010	We had been in Caesarea for several days , when the prophet Agabus came to us from Judea .
44021011	He took Paul's belt , and with it he tied up his own hands and feet . Then he told us , “ The Holy Spirit says that some of the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt . They will also hand him over to the Gentiles . ”
44021012	After Agabus said this , we and the followers living there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem .
44021013	But Paul answered , “ Why are you crying and breaking my heart ? I am not only willing to be put in jail for the Lord Jesus , but I am even willing to die for him in Jerusalem ! ”
44021014	Since we could not get Paul to change his mind , we gave up and prayed , “ Lord , please make us willing to do what you want . ”
44021015	Then we got ready to go to Jerusalem .
44021016	Some of the followers from Caesarea went with us and took us to stay in the home of Mnason . He was from Cyprus and had been a follower from the beginning .
44021017	When we arrived in Jerusalem , the Lord's followers gladly welcomed us .
44021018	Paul went with us to see James the next day , and all the church leaders were present .
44021019	Paul greeted them and told how God had used him to help the Gentiles .
44021020	Everyone who heard this praised God and said to Paul :
44021026	The next day Paul took the four men with him and got himself ready at the same time they did . Then he went into the temple and told when the final ceremony would take place and when an offering would be made for each of them .
44021027	When the period of seven days for the ceremony was almost over , some of the Jewish people from Asia saw Paul in the temple . They got a large crowd together and started attacking him .
44021028	They were shouting , “ Friends , help us ! This man goes around everywhere , saying bad things about our nation and about the Law of Moses and about this temple . He has even brought shame to this holy temple by bringing in Gentiles . ”
44021029	Some of them thought that Paul had brought Trophimus from Ephesus into the temple , because they had seen them together in the city .
44021030	The whole city was in an uproar , and the people turned into a mob . They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple . Then suddenly the doors were shut .
44021031	The people were about to kill Paul when the Roman army commander heard that all Jerusalem was starting to riot .
44021032	So he quickly took some soldiers and officers and ran to where the crowd had gathered . As soon as the mob saw the commander and soldiers , they stopped beating Paul .
44021033	The army commander went over and arrested him and had him bound with two chains . Then he tried to find out who Paul was and what he had done .
44021034	Part of the crowd shouted one thing , and part of them shouted something else . But they were making so much noise that the commander could not find out a thing . Then he ordered Paul to be taken into the fortress .
44021035	As they reached the steps , the crowd became so wild that the soldiers had to lift Paul up and carry him .
44021036	The crowd followed and kept shouting , “ Kill him ! Kill him ! ”
44021037	When Paul was about to be taken into the fortress , he asked the commander , “ Can I say something to you ? ” “ How do you know Greek ? ” the commander asked .
44021038	“ Aren't you that Egyptian who started a riot not long ago and led 4,000 terrorists into the desert ? ”
44021039	“ No ! ” Paul replied . “ I am a Jew from Tarsus , an important city in Cilicia . Please let me speak to the crowd . ”
44021040	The commander told him he could speak , so Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people . When they were quiet , he spoke to them in Aramaic :
44022001	“ My friends and leaders of our nation , listen as I explain what happened ! ”
44022002	When the crowd heard Paul speak to them in Aramaic , they became even quieter . Then Paul said :
44022022	The crowd listened until Paul said this . Then they started shouting , “ Get rid of this man ! He doesn't deserve to live . ”
44022023	They kept shouting . They waved their clothes around and threw dust into the air .
44022024	The Roman commander ordered Paul to be taken into the fortress and beaten with a whip . He did this to find out why the people were screaming at Paul .
44022025	While the soldiers were tying Paul up to be beaten , he asked the officer standing there , “ Is it legal to beat a Roman citizen before he has been tried in court ? ”
44022026	When the officer heard this , he went to the commander and said , “ What are you doing ? This man is a Roman citizen ! ”
44022027	The commander went to Paul and asked , “ Tell me , are you a Roman citizen ? ” “ Yes , ” Paul answered .
44022028	The commander then said , “ I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen . ” But Paul replied , “ I was born a Roman citizen . ”
44022029	The men who were about to beat and question Paul quickly backed off . And the commander himself was frightened when he realized that he had put a Roman citizen in chains .
44022030	The next day the commander wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders had brought charges against Paul . So he had Paul's chains removed , and he ordered the chief priests and the whole council to meet . Then he had Paul led in and made him stand in front of them .
44023001	Paul looked straight at the council members and said , “ My friends , to this day I have served God with a clear conscience ! ”
44023002	Then Ananias the high priest ordered the men standing beside Paul to hit him on the mouth .
44023003	Paul turned to the high priest and said , “ You whitewashed wall ! God will hit you . You sit there to judge me by the Law of Moses . But at the same time you order men to break the Law by hitting me . ”
44023004	The men standing beside Paul asked , “ Don't you know you are insulting God's high priest ? ”
44023005	Paul replied , “ Oh ! I didn't know he was the high priest . The Scriptures do tell us not to speak evil about a leader of our people . ”
44023006	When Paul saw that some of the council members were Sadducees and others were Pharisees , he shouted , “ My friends , I am a Pharisee and the son of a Pharisee . I am on trial simply because I believe that the dead will be raised to life . ”
44023007	As soon as Paul said this , the Pharisees and the Sadducees got into a big argument , and the council members started taking sides .
44023008	The Sadducees do not believe in angels or spirits or that the dead will rise to life . But the Pharisees believe in all of these ,
44023009	and so there was a lot of shouting . Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees . Finally , they became angry and said , “ We don't find anything wrong with this man . Maybe a spirit or an angel really did speak to him . ”
44023010	The argument became fierce , and the commander was afraid that Paul would be pulled apart . So he ordered the soldiers to go in and rescue Paul . Then they took him back into the fortress .
44023011	That night the Lord stood beside Paul and said , “ Don't worry ! Just as you have told others about me in Jerusalem , you must also tell about me in Rome . ”
44023014	Then some of them went to the chief priests and the nation's leaders and said , “ We have promised God that we would not eat a thing until we have killed Paul .
44023015	You and everyone in the council must go to the commander and pretend that you want to find out more about the charges against Paul . Ask for him to be brought before your court . Meanwhile , we will be waiting to kill him before he gets there . ”
44023016	When Paul's nephew heard about the plot , he went to the fortress and told Paul about it .
44023017	So Paul said to one of the army officers , “ Take this young man to the commander . He has something to tell him . ”
44023018	The officer took him to the commander and said , “ The prisoner named Paul asked me to bring this young man to you , because he has something to tell you . ”
44023019	The commander took the young man aside and asked him in private , “ What do you want to tell me ? ”
44023020	He answered , “ Some men are planning to ask you to bring Paul down to the Jewish council tomorrow . They will claim they want to find out more about him .
44023021	But please don't do what they say . More than 40 men are going to attack Paul . They have made a vow not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him . Even now they are waiting to hear what you decide . ”
44023022	The commander sent the young man away after saying to him , “ Don't let anyone know you told me this . ”
44023023	The commander called in two of his officers and told them , “ By nine o'clock tonight have 200 soldiers ready to go to Caesarea . Take along 70 men on horseback and 200 foot soldiers with spears .
44023024	Get a horse ready for Paul and make sure he gets safely through to Felix the governor . ”
44023025	The commander wrote a letter that said :
44023031	The soldiers obeyed the commander's orders , and that same night they took Paul to the city of Antipatris .
44023032	The next day the foot soldiers returned to the fortress and let the soldiers on horseback take him the rest of the way .
44023033	When they came to Caesarea , they gave the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him .
44023034	The governor read the letter . Then he asked Paul and found out that he was from Cilicia .
44023035	The governor said , “ I will listen to your case as soon as the people come to bring their charges against you . ” After saying this , he gave orders for Paul to be kept as a prisoner in Herod's palace .
44024001	Five days later Ananias the high priest , together with some of their leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus , went to the governor to present their case against Paul .
44024002	So Paul was called in , and Tertullus stated the case against him :
44024009	The Jewish crowd spoke up and agreed with what Tertullus had said .
44024010	The governor motioned for Paul to speak , and he began :
44024022	Felix knew a lot about the Lord's Way . But he brought the trial to an end and said , “ I will make my decision after Lysias the commander arrives . ”
44024023	He then ordered the army officer to keep Paul under guard , but not to lock him up or to stop his friends from helping him .
44024024	Several days later Felix and his wife Drusilla , who was Jewish , went to the place where Paul was kept under guard . They sent for Paul and listened while he spoke to them about having faith in Christ Jesus .
44024025	But Felix was frightened when Paul started talking to them about doing right , about self-control , and about the coming judgment . So he said to Paul , “ That's enough for now . You may go . But when I have time I will send for you . ”
44024026	After this , Felix often sent for Paul and talked with him , because he hoped that Paul would offer him a bribe .
44024027	Two years later Porcius Festus became governor in place of Felix . But since Felix wanted to do the Jewish leaders a favor , he kept Paul in jail .
44025001	Three days after Festus had become governor , he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
44025002	There the chief priests and some Jewish leaders told him about their charges against Paul . They also asked Festus
44025003	if he would be willing to bring Paul to Jerusalem . They begged him to do this because they were planning to attack and kill Paul on the way .
44025004	But Festus told them , “ Paul will be kept in Caesarea , and I am soon going there myself .
44025005	If he has done anything wrong , let your leaders go with me and bring charges against him there . ”
44025006	Festus stayed in Jerusalem for eight or ten more days before going to Caesarea . Then the next day he took his place as judge and had Paul brought into court .
44025007	As soon as Paul came in , the leaders from Jerusalem crowded around him and said he was guilty of many serious crimes . But they could not prove anything .
44025008	Then Paul spoke in his own defense , “ I have not broken the Law of my people . And I have not done anything against either the temple or the Emperor . ”
44025009	Festus wanted to please the leaders . So he asked Paul , “ Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried by me on these charges ? ”
44025010	Paul replied , “ I am on trial in the Emperor's court , and that's where I should be tried . You know very well I have not done anything to harm the Jewish nation .
44025011	If I had done something deserving death , I would not ask to escape the death penalty . But I am not guilty of any of these crimes , and no one has the right to hand me over to these people . I now ask to be tried by the Emperor himself . ”
44025012	After Festus had talked this over with members of his council , he told Paul , “ You have asked to be tried by the Emperor , and to the Emperor you will go ! ”
44025013	A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to visit Festus .
44025014	They had been there for several days , when Festus told the king about the charges against Paul . He said :
44025022	Then Agrippa said to Festus , “ I would also like to hear what this man has to say . ” Festus answered , “ You can hear him tomorrow . ”
44025023	The next day Agrippa and Bernice made a big show as they came into the meeting room . High ranking army officers and leading citizens of the town were also there . Festus then ordered Paul to be brought in
44025024	and said :
44026001	Agrippa told Paul , “ You may now speak for yourself . ” Paul stretched out his hand and said :
44026024	Before Paul finished defending himself , Festus shouted , “ Paul , you're crazy ! Too much learning has driven you out of your mind . ”
44026025	But Paul replied , “ Honorable Festus , I am not crazy . What I am saying is true , and it makes sense .
44026026	None of these things happened off in a corner somewhere . I am sure that King Agrippa knows what I am talking about . That's why I can speak so plainly to him . ”
44026027	Then Paul said to Agrippa , “ Do you believe what the prophets said ? I know you do . ”
44026028	Agrippa asked Paul , “ In such a short time do you think you can talk me into being a Christian ? ”
44026029	Paul answered , “ Whether it takes a short time or a long time , I wish you and everyone else who hears me today would become just like me ! Except , of course , for these chains . ”
44026030	Then King Agrippa , Governor Festus , Bernice , and everyone who was with them got up .
44026031	But before they left , they said , “ This man isn't guilty of anything . He doesn't deserve to die or to be put in jail . ”
44026032	Agrippa told Festus , “ Paul could have been set free , if he had not asked to be tried by the Roman Emperor . ”
44027001	When it was time for us to sail to Rome , Captain Julius from the Emperor's special troops was put in charge of Paul and the other prisoners .
44027002	We went aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to some ports along the coast of Asia . Aristarchus from Thessalonica in Macedonia sailed on the ship with us .
44027003	The next day we came to shore at Sidon . Captain Julius was very kind to Paul . He even let him visit his friends , so they could give him whatever he needed .
44027004	When we left Sidon , the winds were blowing against us , and we sailed close to the island of Cyprus to be safe from the wind .
44027005	Then we sailed south of Cilicia and Pamphylia until we came to the port of Myra in Lycia .
44027006	There the army captain found a ship from Alexandria that was going to Italy . So he ordered us to board that ship .
44027007	We sailed along slowly for several days and had a hard time reaching Cnidus . The wind would not let us go any farther in that direction , so we sailed past Cape Salmone , where the island of Crete would protect us from the wind .
44027008	We went slowly along the coast and finally reached a place called Fair Havens , not far from the town of Lasea .
44027009	By now we had already lost a lot of time , and sailing was no longer safe . In fact , even the Great Day of Forgiveness was past .
44027010	Then Paul spoke to the crew of the ship , “ Men , listen to me ! If we sail now , our ship and its cargo will be badly damaged , and many lives will be lost . ”
44027011	But Julius listened to the captain of the ship and its owner , rather than to Paul .
44027012	The harbor at Fair Havens wasn't a good place to spend the winter . Because of this , almost everyone agreed that we should at least try to sail along the coast of Crete as far as Phoenix . It had a harbor that opened toward the southwest and northwest , and we could spend the winter there .
44027013	When a gentle wind from the south started blowing , the men thought it was a good time to do what they had planned . So they pulled up the anchor , and we sailed along the coast of Crete .
44027014	But soon a strong wind called “ The Northeaster ” blew against us from the island .
44027015	The wind struck the ship , and we could not sail against it . So we let the wind carry the ship .
44027016	We went along the island of Cauda on the side that was protected from the wind . We had a hard time holding the lifeboat in place ,
44027017	but finally we got it where it belonged . Then the sailors wrapped ropes around the ship to hold it together . They lowered the sail and let the ship drift along , because they were afraid it might hit the sandbanks in the gulf of Syrtis .
44027018	The storm was so fierce that the next day they threw some of the ship's cargo overboard .
44027019	Then on the third day , with their bare hands they threw overboard some of the ship's gear .
44027020	For several days we could not see either the sun or the stars . A strong wind kept blowing , and we finally gave up all hope of being saved .
44027021	Since none of us had eaten anything for a long time , Paul stood up and told the men :
44027027	For 14 days and nights we had been blown around over the Mediterranean Sea . But about midnight the sailors realized we were getting near land .
44027028	They measured and found that the water was about 40 meters deep . A little later they measured again and found it was only about 30 meters .
44027029	The sailors were afraid that we might hit some rocks , and they let down four anchors from the back of the ship . Then they prayed for daylight .
44027030	The sailors wanted to escape from the ship . So they lowered the lifeboat into the water , pretending that they were letting down some anchors from the front of the ship .
44027031	But Paul said to Captain Julius and the soldiers , “ If the sailors don't stay on the ship , you won't have any chance to save your lives . ”
44027032	The soldiers then cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall into the sea .
44027033	Just before daylight Paul begged the people to eat something . He told them , “ For 14 days you have been so worried that you haven't eaten a thing .
44027034	I beg you to eat something . Your lives depend on it . Do this and not one of you will be hurt . ”
44027035	After Paul had said this , he took a piece of bread and gave thanks to God . Then in front of everyone , he broke the bread and ate some .
44027036	They all felt encouraged , and each of them ate something .
44027037	There were 276 people on the ship ,
44027038	and after everyone had eaten , they threw the cargo of wheat into the sea to make the ship lighter .
44027039	Morning came , and the ship's crew saw a coast they did not recognize . But they did see a cove with a beach . So they decided to try to run the ship aground on the beach .
44027040	They cut the anchors loose and let them sink into the sea . At the same time they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders . Next , they raised the sail at the front of the ship and let the wind carry the ship toward the beach .
44027041	But it ran aground on a sandbank . The front of the ship stuck firmly in the sand , and the rear was being smashed by the force of the waves .
44027042	The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming away and escaping .
44027043	But Captain Julius wanted to save Paul's life , and he did not let the soldiers do what they had planned . Instead , he ordered everyone who could swim to jump into the water and head for shore .
44027044	Then he told the others to hold on to planks of wood or parts of the ship . At last , everyone safely reached shore .
44028001	When we came ashore , we learned that the island was called Malta .
44028002	The local people were very friendly , and they welcomed us by building a fire , because it was rainy and cold .
44028003	After Paul had gathered some wood and had put it on the fire , the heat caused a snake to crawl out , and it bit him on the hand .
44028004	When the local people saw the snake hanging from Paul's hand , they said to each other , “ This man must be a murderer ! He didn't drown in the sea , but the goddess of justice will kill him anyway . ”
44028005	Paul shook the snake off into the fire and wasn't harmed .
44028006	The people kept thinking that Paul would either swell up or suddenly drop dead . They watched him for a long time , and when nothing happened to him , they changed their minds and said , “ This man is a god . ”
44028007	The governor of the island was named Publius , and he owned some of the land around there . Publius was very friendly and welcomed us into his home for three days .
44028008	His father was in bed , sick with fever and stomach trouble , and Paul went to visit him . Paul healed the man by praying and placing his hands on him .
44028009	After this happened , everyone on the island brought their sick people to Paul , and they were all healed .
44028010	The people were very respectful to us , and when we sailed , they gave us everything we needed .
44028011	Three months later we sailed in a ship that had been docked at Malta for the winter . The ship was from Alexandria in Egypt and was known as “ The Twin Gods . ”
44028012	We arrived in Syracuse and stayed for three days .
44028013	From there we sailed to Rhegium . The next day a south wind began to blow , and two days later we arrived in Puteoli .
44028014	There we found some of the Lord's followers , who begged us to stay with them . A week later we left for the city of Rome .
44028015	Some of the followers in Rome heard about us and came to meet us at the Market of Appius and at the Three Inns . When Paul saw them , he thanked God and was encouraged .
44028016	We arrived in Rome , and Paul was allowed to live in a house by himself with a soldier to guard him .
44028017	Three days after we got there , Paul called together some of the Jewish leaders and said :
44028021	The leaders replied , “ No one from Judea has written us a letter about you . And not one of them has come here to report on you or to say anything against you .
44028022	But we would like to hear what you have to say . We understand that people everywhere are against this new group . ”
44028023	They agreed on a time to meet with Paul , and many of them came to his house . From early morning until late in the afternoon , Paul talked to them about God's kingdom . He used the Law of Moses and the Books of the Prophets to try to win them over to Jesus .
44028024	Some of the leaders agreed with what Paul said , but others did not .
44028025	Since they could not agree among themselves , they started leaving . But Paul said , “ The Holy Spirit said the right thing when he sent Isaiah the prophet
44028026	to tell our ancestors , ‘ Go to these people and tell them : You will listen and listen , but never understand . You will look and look , but never see .
44028027	All of you have stubborn hearts . Your ears are stopped up , and your eyes are covered . You cannot see or hear or understand . If you could , you would turn to me , and I would heal you . ’ ”
44028030	For two years Paul stayed in a rented house and welcomed everyone who came to see him .
44028031	He bravely preached about God's kingdom and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ , and no one tried to stop him .
45001001	From Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus . God chose me to be an apostle , and he appointed me to preach the good news
45001002	that he promised long ago by what his prophets said in the holy Scriptures .
45001005	Jesus was kind to me and chose me to be an apostle , so that people of all nations would obey and have faith .
45001006	You are some of those people chosen by Jesus Christ .
45001007	This letter is to all of you in Rome . God loves you and has chosen you to be his very own people . I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
45001008	First , I thank God in the name of Jesus Christ for all of you . I do this because people everywhere in the world are talking about your faith .
45001009	God has seen how I never stop praying for you , while I serve him with all my heart and tell the good news about his Son .
45001010	In all my prayers , I ask God to make it possible for me to visit you .
45001011	I want to see you and share with you the same blessings that God's Spirit has given me . Then you will grow stronger in your faith .
45001012	What I am saying is that we can encourage each other by the faith that is ours .
45001013	My friends , I want you to know that I have often planned to come for a visit . But something has always kept me from doing it . I want to win followers to Christ in Rome , as I have done in many other places .
45001016	I am proud of the good news ! It is God's powerful way of saving all people who have faith , whether they are Jews or Gentiles .
45001017	The good news tells how God accepts everyone who has faith , but only those who have faith . It is just as the Scriptures say , “ The people God accepts because of their faith will live . ”
45001018	From heaven God shows how angry he is with all the wicked and evil things that sinful people do to crush the truth .
45001019	They know everything that can be known about God , because God has shown it all to them .
45001020	God's eternal power and character cannot be seen . But from the beginning of creation , God has shown what these are like by all he has made . That's why those people don't have any excuse .
45001021	They know about God , but they don't honor him or even thank him . Their thoughts are useless , and their stupid minds are in the dark .
45001022	They claim to be wise , but they are fools .
45001023	They don't worship the glorious and eternal God . Instead , they worship idols that are made to look like humans who cannot live forever , and like birds , animals , and reptiles .
45001024	So God let these people go their own way . They did what they wanted to do , and their filthy thoughts made them do shameful things with their bodies .
45001025	They gave up the truth about God for a lie , and they worshiped God's creation instead of God , who will be praised forever . Amen .
45001026	God let them follow their own evil desires . Women no longer wanted to have sex in a natural way , and they did things with each other that were not natural .
45001027	Men behaved in the same way . They stopped wanting to have sex with women and had strong desires for sex with other men . They did shameful things with each other , and what has happened to them is punishment for their foolish deeds .
45001028	Since these people refused even to think about God , he let their useless minds rule over them . That's why they do all sorts of indecent things .
45001029	They are evil , wicked , and greedy , as well as mean in every possible way . They want what others have , and they murder , argue , cheat , and are hard to get along with . They gossip ,
45001030	say cruel things about others , and hate God . They are proud , conceited , and boastful , always thinking up new ways to do evil . These people don't respect their parents .
45001031	They are stupid , unreliable , and don't have any love or pity for others .
45001032	They know God has said that anyone who acts this way deserves to die . But they keep on doing evil things , and they even encourage others to do them .
45002001	Some of you accuse others of doing wrong . But there is no excuse for what you do . When you judge others , you condemn yourselves , because you are guilty of doing the very same things .
45002002	We know that God is right to judge everyone who behaves in this way .
45002003	Do you really think God won't punish you , when you behave exactly like the people you accuse ?
45002004	You surely don't think much of God's wonderful goodness or of his patience and willingness to put up with you . Don't you know that the reason God is good to you is because he wants you to turn to him ?
45002005	But you are stubborn and refuse to turn to God . So you are making things even worse for yourselves on that day when he will show how angry he is and will judge the world with fairness .
45002006	God will reward each of us for what we have done .
45002007	He will give eternal life to everyone who has patiently done what is good in the hope of receiving glory , honor , and life that lasts forever .
45002008	But he will show how angry and furious he can be with every selfish person who rejects the truth and wants to do evil .
45002009	All who are wicked will be punished with trouble and suffering . It doesn't matter if they are Jews or Gentiles .
45002010	But all who do right will be rewarded with glory , honor , and peace , whether they are Jews or Gentiles .
45002011	God doesn't have any favorites !
45002012	Those people who don't know about God's Law will still be punished for what they do wrong . And the Law will be used to judge everyone who knows what it says .
45002013	God accepts those who obey his Law , but not those who simply hear it .
45002014	Some people naturally obey the Law's commands , even though they don't have the Law .
45002015	This proves that the conscience is like a law written in the human heart . And it will show whether we are forgiven or condemned ,
45002016	when God appoints Jesus Christ to judge everyone's secret thoughts , just as my message says .
45002017	Some of you call yourselves Jews . You trust in the Law and take pride in God .
45002018	By reading the Scriptures you learn how God wants you to behave , and you discover what is right .
45002019	You are sure that you are a guide for the blind and a light for all who are in the dark .
45002020	And since there is knowledge and truth in God's Law , you think you can instruct fools and teach young people .
45002021	But how can you teach others when you refuse to learn ? You preach it is wrong to steal . But do you steal ?
45002022	You say people should be faithful in marriage . But are you faithful ? You hate idols , yet you rob their temples .
45002023	You take pride in the Law , but you disobey the Law and bring shame to God .
45002024	It is just as the Scriptures tell us , “ You have made foreigners say insulting things about God . ”
45002025	Being circumcised is worthwhile , if you obey the Law . But if you don't obey the Law , you are no better off than people who are not circumcised .
45002026	In fact , if they obey the Law , they are as good as anyone who is circumcised .
45002027	So everyone who obeys the Law , but has never been circumcised , will condemn you . Even though you are circumcised and have the Law , you still don't obey its teachings .
45002028	Just because you live like a Jew and are circumcised doesn't make you a real Jew .
45002029	To be a real Jew you must obey the Law . True circumcision is something that happens deep in your heart , not something done to your body . And besides , you should want praise from God and not from humans .
45003001	What good is it to be a Jew ? What good is it to be circumcised ?
45003002	It is good in a lot of ways ! First of all , God's messages were spoken to the Jews .
45003003	It is true that some of them did not believe the message . But does this mean that God cannot be trusted , just because they did not have faith ?
45003004	No , indeed ! God tells the truth , even if everyone else is a liar . The Scriptures say about God , “ Your words will be proven true , and in court you will win your case . ”
45003005	If our evil deeds show how right God is , then what can we say ? Is it wrong for God to become angry and punish us ? What a foolish thing to ask .
45003006	But the answer is , “ No . ” Otherwise , how could God judge the world ?
45003007	Since your lies bring great honor to God by showing how truthful he is , you may ask why God still says you are a sinner .
45003008	You might as well say , “ Let's do something evil , so that something good will come of it ! ” Some people even claim that we are saying this . But God is fair and will judge them as well .
45003009	What does all this mean ? Does it mean that we Jews are better off than the Gentiles ? No , it doesn't ! Jews , as well as Gentiles , are ruled by sin , just as I have said .
45003010	The Scriptures tell us , “ No one is acceptable to God !
45003011	Not one of them understands or even searches for God .
45003012	They have all turned away and are worthless . There isn't one person who does right .
45003013	Their words are like an open pit , and their tongues are good only for telling lies . Each word is as deadly as the fangs of a snake ,
45003014	and they say nothing but bitter curses .
45003015	These people quickly become violent .
45003016	Wherever they go , they leave ruin and destruction .
45003017	They don't know how to live in peace .
45003018	They don't even fear God . ”
45003019	We know that everything in the Law was written for those who are under its power . The Law says these things to stop anyone from making excuses and to let God show that the whole world is guilty .
45003020	God doesn't accept people simply because they obey the Law . No , indeed ! All the Law does is to point out our sin .
45003021	Now we see how God does make us acceptable to him . The Law and the Prophets tell how we become acceptable , and it isn't by obeying the Law of Moses .
45003022	God treats everyone alike . He accepts people only because they have faith in Jesus Christ .
45003023	All of us have sinned and fallen short of God's glory .
45003024	But God treats us much better than we deserve , and because of Christ Jesus , he freely accepts us and sets us free from our sins .
45003027	What is left for us to brag about ? Not a thing ! Is it because we obeyed some law ? No ! It is because of faith .
45003028	We see that people are acceptable to God because they have faith , and not because they obey the Law .
45003029	Does God belong only to the Jews ? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles ? Yes , he is !
45003030	There is only one God , and he accepts Gentiles as well as Jews , simply because of their faith .
45003031	Do we destroy the Law by our faith ? Not at all ! We make it even more powerful .
45004001	Well then , what can we say about our ancestor Abraham ?
45004002	If he became acceptable to God because of what he did , then he would have something to brag about . But he would never be able to brag about it to God .
45004003	The Scriptures say , “ God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him . ”
45004004	Money paid to workers isn't a gift . It is something they earn by working .
45004005	But you cannot make God accept you because of something you do . God accepts sinners only because they have faith in him .
45004006	In the Scriptures David talks about the blessings that come to people who are acceptable to God , even though they don't do anything to deserve these blessings . David says ,
45004009	Are these blessings meant for circumcised people or for those who are not circumcised ? Well , the Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith in him .
45004010	But when did this happen ? Was it before or after Abraham was circumcised ? Of course , it was before .
45004011	Abraham let himself be circumcised to show he had been accepted because of his faith even before he was circumcised . This makes Abraham the father of all who are acceptable to God because of their faith , even though they are not circumcised .
45004012	This also makes Abraham the father of everyone who is circumcised and has faith in God , as Abraham did before he was circumcised .
45004013	God promised Abraham and his descendants that he would give them the world . This promise wasn't made because Abraham had obeyed a law , but because his faith in God made him acceptable .
45004014	If Abraham and his descendants were given this promise because they had obeyed a law , then faith would mean nothing , and the promise would be worthless .
45004015	God becomes angry when his Law is broken . But where there isn't a law , it cannot be broken .
45004016	Everything depends on having faith in God , so that God's promise is assured by his gift of undeserved grace . This promise isn't only for Abraham's descendants who have the Law . It is for all who are Abraham's descendants because they have faith , just as he did . Abraham is the ancestor of us all .
45004017	The Scriptures say that Abraham would become the ancestor of many nations . This promise was made to Abraham because he had faith in God , who raises the dead to life and creates new things .
45004018	God promised Abraham a lot of descendants . And when it all seemed hopeless , Abraham still had faith in God and became the ancestor of many nations .
45004019	Abraham's faith never became weak , not even when he was nearly 100 years old . He knew he was almost dead and that his wife Sarah could not have children .
45004020	But Abraham never doubted or questioned God's promise . His faith made him strong , and he gave all the credit to God .
45004021	Abraham was certain that God could do what he had promised .
45004022	So God accepted him ,
45004023	just as we read in the Scriptures . But these words were not written only for Abraham .
45004024	They were written for us , since we will also be accepted because of our faith in God , who raised our Lord Jesus to life .
45004025	God gave Jesus to die for our sins , and he raised him to life , so that we would be made acceptable to God .
45005001	By faith we have been made acceptable to God . And now , thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ , we have peace with God .
45005002	Christ has also introduced us to God's gift of undeserved grace on which we now take our stand . So we are happy , as we look forward to sharing in the glory of God .
45005003	But that's not all ! We gladly suffer , because we know that suffering helps us to endure .
45005004	And endurance builds character , which gives us a hope
45005005	that will never disappoint us . All of this happens because God has given us the Holy Spirit , who fills our hearts with his love .
45005006	Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful .
45005007	No one is really willing to die for an honest person , though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person .
45005008	But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us , even though we were sinful .
45005009	But there is more ! Now that God has accepted us because Christ sacrificed his life's blood , we will also be kept safe from God's anger .
45005010	Even when we were God's enemies , he made peace with us , because his Son died for us . Yet something even greater than friendship is ours . Now that we are at peace with God , we will be saved by the life of his Son .
45005011	And in addition to everything else , we are happy because God sent our Lord Jesus Christ to make peace with us .
45005012	Adam sinned , and that sin brought death into the world . Now everyone has sinned , and so everyone must die .
45005013	Sin was in the world before the Law came . But no record of sin was kept , because there was no Law .
45005014	Yet death still had power over all who lived from the time of Adam to the time of Moses . This happened , though not everyone disobeyed a direct command from God , as Adam did . In some ways Adam is like Christ who came later .
45005015	But the gift of God's undeserved grace was very different from Adam's sin . That one sin brought death to many others . Yet in an even greater way , Jesus Christ alone brought God's gift of undeserved grace to many people .
45005016	There is a lot of difference between Adam's sin and God's gift . That one sin led to punishment . But God's gift made it possible for us to be acceptable to him , even though we have sinned many times .
45005017	Death ruled like a king because Adam had sinned . But that cannot compare with what Jesus Christ has done . God has treated us with undeserved grace , and he has accepted us because of Jesus . And so we will live and rule like kings .
45005018	Everyone was going to be punished because Adam sinned . But because of the good thing that Christ has done , God accepts us and gives us the gift of life .
45005019	Adam disobeyed God and caused many others to be sinners . But Jesus obeyed him and will make many people acceptable to God .
45005020	The Law came , so that the full power of sin could be seen . Yet where sin was powerful , God's gift of undeserved grace was even more powerful .
45005021	Sin ruled by means of death . But God's gift of grace now rules , and God has accepted us because of Jesus Christ our Lord . This means that we will have eternal life .
45006001	What should we say ? Should we keep on sinning , so that God's gift of undeserved grace will show up even better ?
45006002	No , we should not ! If we are dead to sin , how can we go on sinning ?
45006003	Don't you know that all who share in Christ Jesus by being baptized also share in his death ?
45006004	When we were baptized , we died and were buried with Christ . We were baptized , so we would live a new life , as Christ was raised to life by the glory of God the Father .
45006005	If we shared in Jesus' death by being baptized , we will be raised to life with him .
45006006	We know that the persons we used to be were nailed to the cross with Jesus . This was done , so our sinful bodies would no longer be the slaves of sin .
45006007	We know sin doesn't have power over dead people .
45006008	As surely as we died with Christ , we believe we will also live with him .
45006009	We know that death no longer has any power over Christ . He died and was raised to life , never again to die .
45006010	When Christ died , he died for sin once and for all . But now he is alive , and he lives only for God .
45006011	In the same way , you must think of yourselves as dead to the power of sin . But Christ Jesus has given life to you , and you live for God .
45006012	Don't let sin rule your body . After all , your body is bound to die , so don't obey its desires
45006013	or let any part of it become a slave of evil . Give yourselves to God , as people who have been raised from death to life . Make every part of your body a slave that pleases God .
45006014	Don't let sin keep ruling your lives . You are ruled by God's undeserved grace and not by the Law .
45006015	What does all this mean ? Does it mean we are free to sin , because we are ruled by God's gift of undeserved grace and not by the Law ? Certainly not !
45006016	Don't you know that you are slaves of anyone you obey ? You can be slaves of sin and die , or you can be obedient slaves of God and be acceptable to him .
45006017	You used to be slaves of sin . But I thank God that with all your heart you followed the example set forth in the teaching you received .
45006018	Now you are set free from sin and are slaves who please God .
45006019	I am using these everyday examples , because in some ways you are still weak . You used to let the different parts of your body be slaves of your evil thoughts . But now you must make every part of your body serve God , so that you will belong completely to him .
45006020	When you were slaves of sin , you didn't have to please God .
45006021	But what good did you receive from the things you did ? All you have to show for them is your shame , and they lead to death .
45006022	Now you have been set free from sin , and you are God's slaves . This will make you holy and will lead you to eternal life .
45006023	Sin pays off with death . But God's gift is eternal life given by Jesus Christ our Lord .
45007001	My friends , you surely understand enough about law to know that laws only have power over people who are alive .
45007002	For example , the Law says that a man's wife must remain his wife as long as he lives . But once her husband is dead , she is free
45007003	to marry someone else . However , if she goes off with another man while her husband is still alive , she is said to be unfaithful .
45007004	That is how it is with you , my friends . You are now part of the body of Christ and are dead to the power of the Law . You are free to belong to Christ , who was raised to life so we could serve God .
45007005	When we thought only of ourselves , the Law made us have sinful desires . It made every part of our bodies into slaves who are doomed to die .
45007006	But the Law no longer rules over us . We are like dead people , and it cannot have any power over us . Now we can serve God in a new way by obeying his Spirit , and not in the old way by obeying the written Law .
45007007	Does this mean that the Law is sinful ? Certainly not ! But if it had not been for the Law , I would not have known what sin is really like . For example , I would not have known what it means to want something that belongs to someone else , unless the Law had told me not to do this .
45007008	It was sin that used this command as a way of making me have all kinds of desires . But without the Law , sin is dead .
45007009	Before I knew about the Law , I was alive . But as soon as I heard that command , sin came to life ,
45007010	and I died . The very command that was supposed to bring life to me , instead brought death .
45007011	Sin used this command to trick me , and because of it I died .
45007012	Still , the Law and its commands are holy and correct and good .
45007013	Am I saying something good caused my death ? Certainly not ! It was sin that killed me by using something good . Now we can see how terrible and evil sin really is .
45007014	We know that the Law is spiritual . But I am merely a human , and I have been sold as a slave to sin .
45007015	In fact , I don't understand why I act the way I do . I don't do what I know is right . I do the things I hate .
45007016	Although I don't do what I know is right , I agree that the Law is good .
45007017	So I am not the one doing these evil things . The sin that lives in me is what does them .
45007018	I know that my selfish desires won't let me do anything that is good . Even when I want to do right , I cannot .
45007019	Instead of doing what I know is right , I do wrong .
45007020	And so , if I don't do what I know is right , I am no longer the one doing these evil things . The sin that lives in me is what does them .
45007021	The Law has shown me that something in me keeps me from doing what I know is right .
45007022	With my whole heart I agree with the Law of God .
45007023	But in every part of me I discover something fighting against my mind , and it makes me a prisoner of sin that controls everything I do .
45007024	What a miserable person I am . Who will rescue me from this body that is doomed to die ?
45007025	Thank God ! Jesus Christ will rescue me . So with my mind I serve the Law of God , although my selfish desires make me serve the law of sin .
45008001	If you belong to Christ Jesus , you won't be punished .
45008002	The Holy Spirit will give you life that comes from Christ Jesus and will set you free from sin and death .
45008003	The Law of Moses cannot do this , because our selfish desires make the Law weak . But God set you free when he sent his own Son to be like us sinners and to be a sacrifice for our sin . God used Christ's body to condemn sin .
45008004	He did this , so that we would do what the Law commands by obeying the Spirit instead of our own desires .
45008005	People who are ruled by their desires think only of themselves . Everyone who is ruled by the Holy Spirit thinks about spiritual things .
45008006	If our minds are ruled by our desires , we will die . But if our minds are ruled by the Spirit , we will have life and peace .
45008007	Our desires fight against God , because they do not and cannot obey God's laws .
45008008	If we follow our desires , we cannot please God .
45008009	You are no longer ruled by your desires , but by God's Spirit , who lives in you . People who don't have the Spirit of Christ in them don't belong to him .
45008010	But Christ lives in you . So you are alive because God has accepted you , even though your bodies must die because of your sins .
45008011	Yet God raised Jesus to life ! God's Spirit now lives in you , and he will raise you to life by his Spirit .
45008012	My dear friends , we must not live to satisfy our desires .
45008013	If you do , you will die . But you will live , if by the help of God's Spirit you say “ No ” to your desires .
45008014	Only those people who are led by God's Spirit are his children .
45008015	God's Spirit doesn't make us slaves who are afraid of him . Instead , we become his children and call him our Father .
45008016	God's Spirit makes us sure that we are his children .
45008017	His Spirit lets us know that together with Christ we will be given what God has promised . We will also share in the glory of Christ , because we have suffered with him .
45008018	I am sure what we are suffering now cannot compare with the glory that will be shown to us .
45008019	In fact , all creation is eagerly waiting for God to show who his children are .
45008020	Meanwhile , creation is confused , but not because it wants to be confused . God made it this way in the hope
45008021	that creation would be set free from decay and would share in the glorious freedom of his children .
45008022	We know that all creation is still groaning and is in pain , like a woman about to give birth .
45008023	The Spirit makes us sure about what we will be in the future . But now we groan silently , while we wait for God to show that we are his children . This means that our bodies will also be set free .
45008024	And this hope is what saves us . But if we already have what we hope for , there is no need to keep on hoping .
45008025	However , we hope for something we have not yet seen , and we patiently wait for it .
45008026	In certain ways we are weak , but the Spirit is here to help us . For example , when we don't know what to pray for , the Spirit prays for us in ways that cannot be put into words .
45008027	All of our thoughts are known to God . He can understand what is in the mind of the Spirit , as the Spirit prays for God's people .
45008028	We know that God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him . They are the ones God has chosen for his purpose ,
45008029	and he has always known who his chosen ones would be . He had decided to let them become like his own Son , so his Son would be the first of many children .
45008030	God then accepted the people he had already decided to choose , and he has shared his glory with them .
45008031	What can we say about all this ? If God is on our side , can anyone be against us ?
45008032	God did not keep back his own Son , but he gave him for us . If God did this , won't he freely give us everything else ?
45008033	If God says his chosen ones are acceptable to him , can anyone bring charges against them ?
45008034	Or can anyone condemn them ? No indeed ! Christ died and was raised to life , and now he is at God's right side , speaking to him for us .
45008035	Can anything separate us from the love of Christ ? Can trouble , suffering , and hard times , or hunger and nakedness , or danger and death ?
45008036	It is exactly as the Scriptures say , “ For you we face death all day long . We are like sheep on their way to be butchered . ”
45009001	I am a follower of Christ , and the Holy Spirit is a witness to my conscience . So I tell the truth and I am not lying when I say
45009002	my heart is broken and I am in great sorrow .
45009003	I would gladly be placed under God's curse and be separated from Christ for the good of my own people .
45009004	They are the descendants of Israel , and they are also God's chosen people . God showed them his glory . He made agreements with them and gave them his Law . The temple is theirs and so are the promises that God made to them .
45009005	They have those famous ancestors , who were also the ancestors of the Christ . I pray that God , who rules over all , will be praised forever ! Amen .
45009006	It cannot be said that God broke his promise . After all , not all of the people of Israel are the true people of God .
45009009	Sarah , “ At this time next year I will return , and you will already have a son . ”
45009010	Don't forget what happened to the twin sons of Isaac and Rebekah .
45009013	That's why the Scriptures say that the Lord liked Jacob more than Esau .
45009014	Are we saying God is unfair ? Certainly not !
45009015	The Lord told Moses that he has pity and mercy on anyone he wants to .
45009016	Everything then depends on God's mercy and not on what people want or do .
45009017	In the Scriptures the Lord says to the king of Egypt , “ I let you become king , so that I could show you my power and be praised by all people on earth . ”
45009018	Everything depends on what God decides to do , and he can either have pity on people or make them stubborn .
45009019	Someone may ask , “ How can God blame us , if he makes us behave in the way he wants us to ? ”
45009020	But , my friend , I ask , “ Who do you think you are to question God ? Does the clay have the right to ask the potter why he shaped it the way he did ?
45009021	Doesn't a potter have the right to make a fancy bowl and a plain bowl out of the same lump of clay ? ”
45009022	God wanted to show his anger and reveal his power against everyone who deserved to be destroyed . But instead , he patiently put up with them .
45009023	He did this by showing how glorious he is when he has pity on the people he has chosen to share in his glory .
45009024	Whether Jews or Gentiles , we are those chosen ones ,
45009025	just as the Lord says in the book of Hosea , “ Although they are not my people , I will make them my people . I will treat with love those nations that have never been loved .
45009026	“ Once they were told , ‘ You are not my people . ’ But in that very place they will be called children of the living God . ”
45009027	And this is what the prophet Isaiah said about the people of Israel , “ The people of Israel are as many as the grains of sand along the beach . But only a few who are left will be saved .
45009028	The Lord will be quick and sure to do on earth what he has warned he will do . ”
45009029	Isaiah also said , “ If the Lord All-Powerful had not spared some of our descendants , we would have been destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . ”
45009030	What does all of this mean ? It means that the Gentiles were not trying to be acceptable to God , but they found that he would accept them if they had faith .
45009033	just as God says in the Scriptures , “ Look ! I am placing in Zion a stone to make people stumble and fall . But those who have faith in that one will never be disappointed . ”
45010001	Dear friends , my greatest wish and my prayer to God is for the people of Israel to be saved .
45010002	I know they love God , but they don't understand
45010003	what makes people acceptable to him . So they refuse to trust God , and they try to be acceptable by obeying the Law .
45010004	But Christ makes the Law no longer necessary for those who become acceptable to God by faith .
45010005	Moses said a person could become acceptable to God by obeying the Law . He did this when he wrote , “ If you want to live , you must do all the Law commands . ”
45010006	But people whose faith makes them acceptable to God will never ask , “ Who will go up to heaven to bring Christ down ? ”
45010007	Neither will they ask , “ Who will go down into the world of the dead to raise him to life ? ”
45010008	All who are acceptable because of their faith simply say , “ The message is as near as your mouth or your heart . ” And this is the same message we preach about faith .
45010009	So you will be saved , if you honestly say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” and if you believe with all your heart that God raised him from death .
45010010	God will accept you and save you , if you truly believe this and tell it to others .
45010011	The Scriptures say no one who has faith will be disappointed ,
45010012	no matter if that person is a Jew or a Gentile . There is only one Lord , and he is generous to everyone who asks for his help .
45010013	All who call out to the Lord will be saved .
45010014	How can people have faith in the Lord and ask him to save them , if they have never heard about him ? And how can they hear , unless someone tells them ?
45010015	And how can anyone tell them without being sent by the Lord ? The Scriptures say it is a beautiful sight to see even the feet of someone coming to preach the good news .
45010016	Yet not everyone has believed the message . For example , the prophet Isaiah asked , “ Lord , has anyone believed what we said ? ”
45010017	No one can have faith without hearing the message about Christ .
45010018	But am I saying that the people of Israel did not hear ? No , I am not ! The Scriptures say , “ The message was told everywhere on earth . It was announced all over the world . ” “ I will make Israel jealous of people who are a nation of nobodies . I will make them angry with people who don't understand a thing . ” “ I was found by people who were not looking for me . I appeared to the ones who were not asking about me . ” “ All day long the Lord has reached out to people who are stubborn and refuse to obey . ”
45011001	Am I saying that God has turned his back on his people ? Certainly not ! I am one of the people of Israel , and I myself am a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God did not turn his back on his chosen people . Don't you remember reading in the Scriptures how Elijah complained to God about the people of Israel ?
45011003	He said , “ Lord , they killed your prophets and destroyed your altars . I am the only one left , and now they want to kill me . ”
45011004	But the Lord told Elijah , “ I still have 7,000 followers who have not worshiped Baal . ”
45011005	It is the same way now . God treated the people of Israel with undeserved grace , and so a few of them are still his followers .
45011006	This happened because of God's undeserved kindness and not because of anything they have done . It could not have happened except for God's gift of undeserved grace .
45011007	This means that only a chosen few of the people of Israel found what all of them were searching for . And the rest of them were stubborn ,
45011008	just as the Scriptures say , “ God made them so stupid that their eyes are blind , and their ears are still deaf . ”
45011009	Then David said , “ Turn their meals into bait for a trap , so that they will stumble and be given what they deserve .
45011010	Blindfold their eyes ! Don't let them see . Bend their backs beneath a burden that will never be lifted . ”
45011011	Do I mean that the people of Israel fell , never to get up again ? Certainly not ! Their failure made it possible for the Gentiles to be saved , and this will make the people of Israel jealous .
45011012	But if the rest of the world's people were helped so much by their sin and loss , they will be helped even more by their full return .
45011013	I am now speaking to you Gentiles , and as long as I am an apostle to you , I will take pride in my work .
45011014	I hope in this way to make some of my own people jealous enough to be saved .
45011015	When Israel rejected God , the rest of the people in the world were able to turn to him . So when God makes friends with Israel , it will be like bringing the dead back to life .
45011016	If part of a batch of dough is made holy by being offered to God , then all of the dough is holy . If the roots of a tree are holy , the rest of the tree is holy too .
45011017	You Gentiles are like branches of a wild olive tree made to be part of a cultivated olive tree . You have taken the place of some branches that were cut away from it . And because of this , you enjoy the blessings that come from being part of that cultivated tree .
45011018	But don't think you are better than the branches that were cut away . Just remember you are not supporting the roots of this tree . Its roots are supporting you .
45011019	Maybe you think those branches were cut away , so you could be put in their place .
45011020	That's true enough . But they were cut away because they did not have faith , and you are where you are because you do have faith . So don't be proud , but be afraid .
45011021	If God cut away those natural branches , couldn't he do the same to you ?
45011022	Now you see both how kind and how hard God can be . He was hard on those who fell , but he was kind to you . And he will keep on being kind to you , if you keep on trusting in his kindness . Otherwise , you will be cut away too .
45011023	If those other branches will start having faith , they will be made a part of that tree again . God has the power to put them back .
45011024	After all , it wasn't natural for branches to be cut from a wild olive tree and to be made part of a cultivated olive tree . So it is much more likely that God will join the natural branches back to the cultivated olive tree .
45011025	My friends , I don't want you Gentiles to be too proud of yourselves . So I will explain the mystery of what has happened to the people of Israel . Some of them have become stubborn , and they will stay like that until the complete number of you Gentiles has come in .
45011026	In this way all of Israel will be saved , as the Scriptures say , “ From Zion someone will come to rescue us . Then Jacob's descendants will stop being evil .
45011027	This is what the Lord has promised to do when he forgives their sins . ”
45011028	The people of Israel are treated as God's enemies , so the good news can come to you Gentiles . But they are still the chosen ones , and God loves them because of their famous ancestors .
45011029	God doesn't take back the gifts he has given or disown the people he has chosen .
45011030	At one time you Gentiles rejected God . But now Israel has rejected God , and you have been shown mercy .
45011031	And because of the mercy shown to you , they will also be shown mercy .
45011032	All people have disobeyed God , and that's why he treats them as prisoners . But he does this , so that he can have mercy on all of them .
45011033	Who can measure the wealth and wisdom and knowledge of God ? Who can understand his decisions or explain what he does ?
45011034	“ Has anyone known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice ?
45011035	Has anyone loaned something to the Lord that must be repaid ? ”
45012001	Dear friends , God is good . So I beg you to offer your bodies to him as a living sacrifice , pure and pleasing . That's the most sensible way to serve God .
45012002	Don't be like the people of this world , but let God change the way you think . Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him .
45012003	I realize God has treated me with undeserved grace , and so I tell each of you not to think you are better than you really are . Use good sense and measure yourself by the amount of faith that God has given you .
45012004	A body is made up of many parts , and each of them has its own use .
45012005	That's how it is with us . There are many of us , but we each are part of the body of Christ , as well as part of one another .
45012006	God has also given each of us different gifts to use . If we can prophesy , we should do it according to the amount of faith we have .
45012007	If we can serve others , we should serve . If we can teach , we should teach .
45012008	If we can encourage others , we should encourage them . If we can give , we should be generous . If we are leaders , we should do our best . If we are good to others , we should do it cheerfully .
45012009	Be sincere in your love for others . Hate everything that is evil and hold tight to everything that is good .
45012010	Love each other as brothers and sisters and honor others more than you do yourself .
45012011	Never give up . Eagerly follow the Holy Spirit and serve the Lord .
45012012	Let your hope make you glad . Be patient in time of trouble and never stop praying .
45012013	Take care of God's needy people and welcome strangers into your home .
45012014	Ask God to bless everyone who mistreats you . Ask him to bless them and not to curse them .
45012015	When others are happy , be happy with them , and when they are sad , be sad .
45012016	Be friendly with everyone . Don't be proud and feel that you know more than others . Make friends with ordinary people .
45012017	Don't mistreat someone who has mistreated you . But try to earn the respect of others ,
45012018	and do your best to live at peace with everyone .
45012019	Dear friends , don't try to get even . Let God take revenge . In the Scriptures the Lord says , “ I am the one to take revenge and pay them back . ” “ If your enemies are hungry , give them something to eat . And if they are thirsty , give them something to drink . This will be the same as piling burning coals on their heads . ”
45013001	Obey the rulers who have authority over you . Only God can give authority to anyone , and he puts these rulers in their places of power .
45013002	People who oppose the authorities are opposing what God has done , and they will be punished .
45013003	Rulers are a threat to evil people , not to good people . There is no need to be afraid of the authorities . Just do right , and they will praise you for it .
45013004	After all , they are God's servants , and it is their duty to help you . If you do something wrong , you ought to be afraid , because these rulers have the right to punish you . They are God's servants who punish criminals to show how angry God is .
45013005	But you should obey the rulers because you know it is the right thing to do , and not just because of God's anger .
45013006	You must also pay your taxes . The authorities are God's servants , and it is their duty to take care of these matters .
45013007	Pay all that you owe , whether it is taxes and fees or respect and honor .
45013008	Let love be your only debt ! If you love others , you have done all that the Law demands .
45013009	In the Law there are many commands , such as , “ Be faithful in marriage . Do not murder . Do not steal . Do not want what belongs to others . ” But all of these are summed up in the command that says , “ Love others as much as you love yourself . ”
45013010	No one who loves others will harm them . So love is all that the Law demands .
45013011	You know what sort of times we live in , and so you should live properly . It is time to wake up . You know that the day when we will be saved is nearer now than when we first put our faith in the Lord .
45013012	Night is almost over , and day will soon appear . We must stop behaving as people do in the dark and be ready to live in the light .
45013013	So behave properly , as people do in the day . Don't go to wild parties or get drunk or be vulgar or indecent . Don't quarrel or be jealous .
45013014	Let the Lord Jesus Christ be as near to you as the clothes you wear . Then you won't try to satisfy your selfish desires .
45014001	Welcome all the Lord's followers , even those whose faith is weak . Don't criticize them for having beliefs that are different from yours .
45014002	Some think it is all right to eat anything , while those whose faith is weak will eat only vegetables .
45014003	But you should not criticize others for eating or for not eating . After all , God welcomes everyone .
45014004	What right do you have to criticize someone else's servants ? Only their Lord can decide if they are doing right , and the Lord will make sure that they do right .
45014005	Some of the Lord's followers think one day is more important than another . Others think all days are the same . But each of you should make up your own mind .
45014006	Any followers who count one day more important than another day do it to honor their Lord . And any followers who eat meat give thanks to God , just like the ones who don't eat meat .
45014007	Whether we live or die , it must be for God , rather than for ourselves .
45014008	Whether we live or die , it must be for the Lord . Alive or dead , we still belong to the Lord .
45014009	This is because Christ died and rose to life , so that he would be the Lord of the dead and of the living .
45014010	Why do you criticize other followers of the Lord ? Why do you look down on them ? The day is coming when God will judge all of us .
45014011	In the Scriptures God says , “ I swear by my very life that everyone will kneel down and praise my name ! ”
45014013	We must stop judging others . We must also make up our minds not to upset anyone's faith .
45014014	The Lord Jesus has made it clear to me that God considers all foods fit to eat . But if you think some foods are unfit to eat , then for you they are not fit .
45014015	If you are hurting others by the foods you eat , you are not guided by love . Don't let your appetite destroy someone Christ died for .
45014016	Don't let your right to eat bring shame to Christ .
45014017	God's kingdom isn't about eating and drinking . It is about pleasing God , about living in peace , and about true happiness . All this comes from the Holy Spirit .
45014018	If you serve Christ in this way , you will please God and be respected by people .
45014019	We should try to live at peace and help each other have a strong faith .
45014020	Don't let your appetite destroy what God has done . All foods are fit to eat , but it is wrong to cause problems for others by what you eat .
45014021	It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that causes problems for other followers of the Lord .
45014022	What you believe about these things should be kept between you and God . You are fortunate , if your actions don't make you have doubts .
45014023	But if you do have doubts about what you eat , you are going against your beliefs . And you know that is wrong , because anything you do against your beliefs is sin .
45015001	If our faith is strong , we should be patient with the Lord's followers whose faith is weak . We should try to please them instead of ourselves .
45015002	We should think of their good and try to help them by doing what pleases them .
45015003	Even Christ did not try to please himself . But as the Scriptures say , “ The people who insulted you also insulted me . ”
45015004	And the Scriptures were written to teach and encourage us by giving us hope .
45015005	God is the one who makes us patient and cheerful . I pray that he will help you live at peace with each other , as you follow Christ .
45015006	Then all of you together will praise God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Honor God by accepting each other , as Christ has accepted you .
45015008	I tell you that Christ came as a servant of the Jews to show that God has kept the promises he made to their famous ancestors . Christ also came ,
45015009	so that the Gentiles would praise God for being kind to them . It is just as the Scriptures say , “ I will tell the nations about you , and I will sing praises to your name . ”
45015010	The Scriptures also say to the Gentiles , “ Come and celebrate with God's people . ”
45015011	Again the Scriptures say , “ Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles . All you nations , come and worship him . ”
45015012	Isaiah says , “ Someone from David's family will come to power . He will rule the nations , and they will put their hope in him . ”
45015013	I pray that God , who gives hope , will bless you with complete happiness and peace because of your faith . And may the power of the Holy Spirit fill you with hope .
45015014	My friends , I am sure that you are very good and that you have all the knowledge you need to teach each other .
45015015	But I have spoken to you plainly and have tried to remind you of some things . God treated me with undeserved grace !
45015016	He chose me to be a servant of Christ Jesus for the Gentiles and to do the work of a priest in the service of his good news . God did this so that the Holy Spirit could make the Gentiles into a holy offering , pleasing to him .
45015017	Because of Christ Jesus , I can take pride in my service for God .
45015018	In fact , all I will talk about is how Christ let me speak and work , so that the Gentiles would obey him .
45015019	Indeed , I will tell how Christ worked miracles and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit . I have preached the good news about him all the way from Jerusalem to Illyricum .
45015020	But I have always tried to preach where people have never heard about Christ . I am like a builder who doesn't build on someone else's foundation .
45015021	It is just as the Scriptures say , “ All who haven't been told about him will see him , and those who haven't heard about him will understand . ”
45015022	My work has always kept me from coming to see you .
45015023	Now there is nothing left for me to do in this part of the world , and for years I have wanted to visit you .
45015024	So I plan to stop off on my way to Spain . Then after a short , but refreshing , visit with you , I hope you will quickly send me on .
45015027	This is something they really wanted to do . But sharing their money with the Jews was also like paying back a debt , because the Jews had already shared their spiritual blessings with the Gentiles .
45015028	After I have safely delivered this money , I will visit you and then go on to Spain .
45015029	And when I do arrive in Rome , I know it will be with the full blessings of Christ .
45015030	My friends , by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that comes from the Holy Spirit , I beg you to pray sincerely with me and for me .
45015031	Pray that God will protect me from the unbelievers in Judea , and that his people in Jerusalem will be pleased with what I am doing .
45015032	Ask God to let me come to you and have a pleasant and refreshing visit .
45015033	I pray that God , who gives peace , will be with all of you . Amen .
45016001	I have good things to say about Phoebe , who is a leader in the church at Cenchreae .
45016002	Welcome her in a way that is proper for someone who has faith in the Lord and is one of God's own people . Help her in any way you can . After all , she has proved to be a respected leader for many others , including me .
45016003	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila . They have not only served Christ Jesus together with me ,
45016004	but they have even risked their lives for me . I am grateful for them and so are all the Gentile churches .
45016005	Greet the church that meets in their home . Greet my dear friend Epaenetus , who was the first person in Asia to have faith in Christ .
45016006	Greet Mary , who has worked so hard for you .
45016007	Greet my relatives Andronicus and Junia , who were in jail with me . They are highly respected by the apostles and were followers of Christ before I was .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus , my dear friend whose faith is in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , who serves Christ along with us . Greet my dear friend Stachys .
45016010	Greet Apelles , a faithful servant of Christ . Greet Aristobulus and his family .
45016011	Greet Herodion , who is a relative of mine . Greet Narcissus and the others in his family , who have faith in the Lord .
45016012	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who work hard for the Lord . Greet my dear friend Persis . She also works hard for the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , that special servant of the Lord , and greet his mother , who has been like a mother to me .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , and Hermas , as well as our friends who are with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all of God's people who are with them .
45016016	Be sure to give each other a warm greeting . All of Christ's churches greet you .
45016017	My friends , I beg you to watch out for anyone who causes trouble and divides the church by refusing to do what all of you were taught . Stay away from them !
45016018	They want to serve themselves and not Christ the Lord . Their flattery and fancy talk fool people who don't know any better .
45016019	I am glad that everyone knows how well you obey the Lord . But still , I want you to understand what is good and not have anything to do with evil .
45016020	Then God , who gives peace , will soon crush Satan under your feet . I pray that our Lord Jesus will be kind to you .
45016021	Timothy , who works with me , sends his greetings , and so do my relatives , Lucius , Jason , and Sosipater .
45016022	I , Tertius , also send my greetings . I am a follower of the Lord , and I wrote this letter .
45016025	Praise God ! He can make you strong by means of my good news , which is the message about Jesus Christ . For ages and ages this message was kept secret ,
45016026	but now at last it has been told . The eternal God commanded his prophets to write about the good news , so that all nations would obey and have faith .
45016027	And now , because of Jesus Christ , we can praise the only wise God forever ! Amen .
46001001	From Paul , chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from Sosthenes , who is also a follower .
46001002	To God's church in Corinth . Christ Jesus chose you to be his very own people , and you worship in his name , as we and all others do who call him Lord .
46001003	My prayer is that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
46001004	I never stop thanking my God for treating you with undeserved grace by giving you Christ Jesus ,
46001005	who helps you speak and understand so well .
46001006	Now you are certain that everything we told you about our Lord Christ Jesus is true .
46001007	You are not missing out on any blessings , as you wait for him to return .
46001008	And until the day Christ does return , he will keep you completely innocent .
46001009	God can be trusted , and he chose you to be partners with his Son , our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001010	My dear friends , as a follower of our Lord Jesus Christ , I beg you to get along with each other . Don't take sides . Always try to agree in what you think .
46001011	Several people from Chloe's family have already reported to me that you keep arguing with each other .
46001012	They have said that some of you claim to follow me , while others claim to follow Apollos or Peter or Christ .
46001013	Has Christ been divided up ? Was I nailed to a cross for you ? Were you baptized in my name ?
46001014	I thank God that I didn't baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius .
46001015	Not one of you can say that you were baptized in my name .
46001016	I did baptize the family of Stephanas , but I don't remember if I baptized anyone else .
46001017	Christ did not send me to baptize . He sent me to tell the good news without using words that sound wise and would make the cross of Christ lose its power .
46001018	The message about the cross doesn't make any sense to lost people . But for those of us who are being saved , it is God's power at work .
46001019	As God says in the Scriptures , “ I will destroy the wisdom of all who claim to be wise . I will confuse those who think they know so much . ”
46001020	What happened to those wise people ? What happened to those experts in the Scriptures ? What happened to the ones who think they have all the answers ? Didn't God show that the wisdom of this world is foolish ?
46001021	God was wise and decided not to let the people of this world use their wisdom to learn about him . Instead , God chose to save only those who believe the foolish message we preach .
46001022	Jews ask for miracles , and Greeks want something that sounds wise .
46001023	But we preach that Christ was nailed to a cross . Most Jews have problems with this , and most Gentiles think it is foolish .
46001024	Our message is God's power and wisdom for the Jews and the Greeks that he has chosen .
46001025	Even when God is foolish , he is wiser than everyone else , and even when God is weak , he is stronger than everyone else .
46001026	My dear friends , remember what you were when God chose you . The people of this world didn't think that many of you were wise . Only a few of you were in places of power , and not many of you came from important families .
46001027	But God chose the foolish things of this world to put the wise to shame . He chose the weak things of this world to put the powerful to shame .
46001028	What the world thinks is worthless , useless , and nothing at all is what God has used to destroy what the world considers important .
46001029	God did all this to keep anyone from bragging to him .
46001030	You are God's children . He sent Christ Jesus to save us and to make us wise , acceptable , and holy .
46001031	So if you want to brag , do what the Scriptures say and brag about the Lord .
46002001	Friends , when I came and told you the mystery that God had shared with us , I didn't use big words or try to sound wise .
46002002	In fact , while I was with you , I made up my mind to speak only about Jesus Christ , who had been nailed to a cross .
46002003	At first , I was weak and trembling with fear .
46002004	When I talked with you or preached , I didn't try to prove anything by sounding wise . I simply let God's Spirit show his power .
46002005	That way you would have faith because of God's power and not because of human wisdom .
46002006	We do use wisdom when speaking to people who are mature in their faith . But it isn't the wisdom of this world or of its rulers , who will soon disappear .
46002007	We speak of God's hidden and mysterious wisdom that God decided to use for our glory long before the world began .
46002008	The rulers of this world didn't know anything about this wisdom . If they had known about it , they would not have nailed the glorious Lord to a cross .
46002009	But it is just as the Scriptures say , “ What God has planned for people who love him is more than eyes have seen or ears have heard . It has never even entered our minds ! ”
46002010	God's Spirit has shown you everything . His Spirit finds out everything , even what is deep in the mind of God .
46002011	You are the only one who knows what is in your own mind , and God's Spirit is the only one who knows what is in God's mind .
46002012	But God has given us his Spirit . This is why we don't think the same way that the people of this world think . This is also why we can recognize the blessings God has given us .
46002013	Every word we speak was taught to us by God's Spirit , not by human wisdom . And this same Spirit helps us teach spiritual things to spiritual people .
46002014	This is why only someone who has God's Spirit can understand spiritual blessings . Anyone who doesn't have God's Spirit thinks these blessings are foolish .
46002015	People who are guided by the Spirit can make all kinds of judgments , but they cannot be judged by others .
46002016	The Scriptures ask , “ Has anyone ever known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice ? ”
46003001	My friends , you are acting like the people of this world . That's why I could not speak to you as spiritual people . You are like babies as far as your faith in Christ is concerned .
46003002	So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk . You could not take solid food , and you still cannot ,
46003003	because you are not yet spiritual . You are jealous and argue with each other . This proves you are not spiritual and you are acting like the people of this world .
46003004	Some of you say you follow me , and others claim to follow Apollos . Isn't this how ordinary people behave ?
46003005	Apollos and I are merely servants who helped you to have faith . It was the Lord who made it all happen .
46003006	I planted the seeds , Apollos watered them , but God made them sprout and grow .
46003007	What matters isn't those who planted or watered , but God who made the plants grow .
46003008	The one who plants is just as important as the one who waters . And each one will be paid for what they do .
46003009	Apollos and I work together for God , and you are God's garden and God's building .
46003010	God treated me with undeserved grace and let me become an expert builder . I laid a foundation on which others have built . But we must each be careful how we build ,
46003011	because Christ is the only foundation .
46003014	We will be rewarded if our building is left standing .
46003015	But if it is destroyed by the fire , we will lose everything . Yet we ourselves will be saved , like someone escaping from flames .
46003016	All of you surely know you are God's temple and his Spirit lives in you .
46003017	Together you are God's holy temple , and God will destroy anyone who destroys his temple .
46003018	Don't fool yourselves ! If any of you think you are wise in the things of this world , you will have to become foolish before you can be truly wise .
46003019	This is because God considers the wisdom of this world to be foolish . It is just as the Scriptures say , “ God catches the wise when they try to outsmart him . ”
46003020	The Scriptures also say , “ The Lord knows that the plans made by wise people are useless . ”
46003023	and you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
46004001	Think of us as servants of Christ who have been given the work of explaining God's mysterious ways .
46004002	And since our first duty is to be faithful to the one we work for ,
46004003	it doesn't matter to me if I am judged by you or even by a court of law . In fact , I don't judge myself .
46004004	I don't know of anything against me , but this doesn't prove I am right . The Lord is my judge .
46004005	So don't judge anyone until the Lord returns . He will show what is hidden in the dark and what is in everyone's heart . Then God will be the one who praises each of us .
46004006	Friends , I have used Apollos and myself as examples to teach you the meaning of the saying , “ Follow the rules . ” I want you to stop saying one of us is better than the other .
46004007	What is so special about you ? What do you have that you were not given ? And if it was given to you , how can you brag ?
46004008	Are you already satisfied ? Are you now rich ? Have you become kings while we are still nobodies ? I wish you were kings . Then we could have a share in your kingdom .
46004009	It seems to me that God has put us apostles in the worst possible place . We are like prisoners on their way to death . Angels and the people of this world just laugh at us .
46004010	Because of Christ we are thought of as fools , but Christ has made you wise . We are weak and hated , but you are powerful and respected .
46004011	Even today we go hungry and thirsty and don't have anything to wear except rags . We are mistreated and don't have a place to live .
46004012	We work hard with our own hands , and when people abuse us , we wish them well . When we suffer , we are patient .
46004013	When someone curses us , we answer with kind words . Until now we are thought of as nothing more than the trash and garbage of this world .
46004014	I am not writing to embarrass you . I want to help you , just as parents help their own dear children .
46004015	Ten thousand people may teach you about Christ , but I am your only father . You became my children when I told you about Christ Jesus ,
46004016	and I want you to be like me .
46004017	This is why I sent Timothy to you . I love him like a son , and he is a faithful servant of the Lord . Timothy will tell you what I do to follow Christ and how it agrees with what I always teach about Christ in every church .
46004018	Some of you think I am not coming for a visit , and so you are bragging .
46004019	But if the Lord lets me come , I will soon be there . Then I will find out if the ones who are doing all this bragging really have any power .
46004020	God's kingdom isn't just a lot of words . It is power .
46004021	What do you want me to do when I arrive ? Do you want me to be hard on you or to be kind and gentle ?
46005001	I have heard terrible things about some of you . In fact , you are behaving worse than Gentiles . A man is even sleeping with his own stepmother .
46005002	You are proud , when you ought to feel bad enough to chase away anyone who acts like this .
46005005	You must then hand that man over to Satan . His body will be destroyed , but his spirit will be saved when the Lord Jesus returns .
46005006	Stop being proud ! Don't you know how a little yeast can spread through the whole batch of dough ?
46005007	Get rid of the old yeast ! Then you will be like fresh bread made without yeast , and this is what you are . Our Passover lamb is Christ , who has already been sacrificed .
46005008	So don't celebrate the festival by being evil and sinful , which is like serving bread made with yeast . Be pure and truthful and celebrate by using bread made without yeast .
46005009	In my other letter I told you not to have anything to do with immoral people .
46005010	But I wasn't talking about the people of this world . You would have to leave this world to get away from everyone who is immoral or greedy or who cheats or worships idols .
46005011	I was talking about your own people who are immoral or greedy or worship idols or curse others or get drunk or cheat . Don't even eat with them !
46005012	Why should I judge outsiders ? Aren't we supposed to judge only church members ?
46005013	God judges everyone else . The Scriptures say , “ Chase away any of your own people who are evil . ”
46006001	When one of you has a complaint against another , do you take your complaint to a court of sinners ? Or do you take it to God's people ?
46006002	Don't you know that God's people will judge the world ? And if you are going to judge the world , can't you settle small problems ?
46006003	Don't you know we will judge angels ? And if this is so , we can surely judge everyday matters .
46006004	Why do you take everyday complaints to judges who are not respected by the church ?
46006005	I say this to your shame . Aren't any of you wise enough to act as a judge between one follower and another ?
46006006	Why should one of you take another to be tried by unbelievers ?
46006007	When one of you takes another to court , all of you lose . It would be better to let yourselves be cheated and robbed .
46006008	But instead , you cheat and rob other followers .
46006009	Don't you know that evil people won't have a share in the blessings of God's kingdom ? Don't fool yourselves ! No one who is immoral or worships idols or is unfaithful in marriage or is a pervert or behaves like a homosexual
46006010	will share in God's kingdom . Neither will any thief or greedy person or drunkard or anyone who curses and cheats others .
46006011	Some of you used to be like that . But now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power of God's Spirit have washed you and made you holy and acceptable to God .
46006012	Some of you say , “ We can do anything we want to . ” But I tell you not everything is good for us . So I refuse to let anything have power over me .
46006013	You also say , “ Food is meant for our bodies , and our bodies are meant for food . ” But I tell you that God will destroy them both . We are not supposed to do indecent things with our bodies . We are to use them for the Lord who is in charge of our bodies .
46006014	God will raise us from death by the same power he used when he raised our Lord to life .
46006015	Don't you know that your bodies are part of the body of Christ ? Is it right for me to join part of the body of Christ to a prostitute ? No , it isn't !
46006016	Don't you know that a man who does that becomes part of her body ? The Scriptures say , “ The two of them will be like one person . ”
46006017	But anyone who is joined to the Lord is one in spirit with him .
46006018	Don't be immoral in matters of sex . That is a sin against your own body in a way no other sin is .
46006019	You surely know that your body is a temple where the Holy Spirit lives . The Spirit is in you and is a gift from God . You are no longer your own .
46006020	God paid a great price for you . So use your body to honor God .
46007001	Now I will answer the questions you asked in your letter . You asked , “ Is it best for people not to marry ? ”
46007002	Well , having your own husband or wife should keep you from doing something immoral .
46007003	Husbands and wives should be fair with each other about having sex .
46007004	A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself , and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself .
46007005	So don't refuse sex to each other , unless you agree not to have sex for a little while , in order to spend time in prayer . Then Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	In my opinion that is what should be done , though I don't know of anything the Lord said about this matter .
46007007	I wish all of you were like me , but God has given different gifts to each of us .
46007008	My advice for the unmarried and for widows is that it is acceptable for them to remain single , just as I am .
46007009	But if you don't have enough self-control , then go ahead and get married . After all , it is better to marry than to burn with desire .
46007010	I instruct married couples to stay together , and this is exactly what the Lord himself taught . A wife who leaves her husband
46007011	should either stay single or go back to her husband . And a husband should not leave his wife .
46007012	I don't know of anything else the Lord said about marriage . All I can do is to give you my own advice . If your wife isn't a follower of the Lord , but is willing to stay with you , don't divorce her .
46007013	If your husband isn't a follower , but is willing to stay with you , don't divorce him .
46007014	Your husband or wife who isn't a follower is made holy by having you as a partner . This also makes your children holy and keeps them from being unclean in God's sight .
46007015	If your husband or wife isn't a follower of the Lord and decides to divorce you , then you should agree to it . You are no longer bound to that person . After all , God chose you and wants you to live at peace .
46007016	And besides , how do you know if you will be able to save your husband or wife who isn't a follower ?
46007017	In every church I tell the people to stay as they were when the Lord Jesus chose them and God called them to be his own . Now I say the same thing to you .
46007018	If you are already circumcised , don't try to change it . If you are not circumcised , don't get circumcised .
46007019	Being circumcised or uncircumcised isn't really what matters . The important thing is to obey God's commands .
46007020	So don't try to change what you were when God chose you .
46007021	Are you a slave ? Don't let that bother you . But if you can win your freedom , you should .
46007022	When the Lord chooses slaves , they become his free people . And when he chooses free people , they become slaves of Christ .
46007023	God paid a great price for you . So don't become slaves of anyone else .
46007024	Stay what you were when God chose you .
46007025	I don't know of anything the Lord said about people who have never been married . But I will tell you what I think . And you can trust me , because the Lord has treated me with kindness .
46007026	We are now going through hard times , and I think it is best for you to stay as you are .
46007027	If you are married , stay married . If you are not married , don't try to get married .
46007028	It isn't wrong to marry , even if you have never been married before . But those who marry will have a lot of trouble , and I want to protect you from this .
46007029	My friends , what I mean is that the Lord will soon come , and it won't matter if you are married or not .
46007030	It will be all the same if you are crying or laughing , or if you are buying or are completely broke .
46007031	It won't make any difference how much good you are getting from this world or how much you like it . This world as we know it is now passing away .
46007032	I want all of you to be free from worry . An unmarried man worries about how to please the Lord .
46007033	But a married man has more worries . He must worry about the things of this world , because he wants to please his wife .
46007034	So he is pulled in two directions . Unmarried women and women who have never been married worry only about pleasing the Lord , and they keep their bodies and minds pure . But a married woman worries about the things of this world , because she wants to please her husband .
46007035	What I am saying is for your own good — it isn't to limit your freedom . I want to help you to live right and to love the Lord above all else .
46007036	But suppose you are engaged to someone old enough to be married , and you want her so much that all you can think about is getting married . Then go ahead and marry . There is nothing wrong with that .
46007037	But it is better to have self-control and to make up your mind not to marry .
46007038	It is perfectly all right to marry , but it is better not to get married at all .
46007039	A wife should stay married to her husband until he dies . Then she is free to marry again , but only to a man who is a follower of the Lord .
46007040	However , I think I am obeying God's Spirit when I say she would be happier to stay single .
46008001	In your letter you asked me about food offered to idols . All of us know something about this subject . But knowledge makes us proud of ourselves , while love makes us helpful to others .
46008002	In fact , people who think they know so much don't know anything at all .
46008003	But God has no doubts about who loves him .
46008004	Even though food is offered to idols , we know that none of the idols in this world are alive . After all , there is only one God .
46008005	Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords , but none of them really are gods or lords .
46008006	We have only one God , and he is the Father . He created everything , and we live for him . Jesus Christ is our only Lord . Everything was made by him , and by him life was given to us .
46008007	Not everyone knows these things . In fact , many people have grown up with the belief that idols have life in them . So when they eat meat offered to idols , they are bothered by a weak conscience .
46008008	But food doesn't bring us any closer to God . We are no worse off if we don't eat , and we are no better off if we do .
46008009	Don't cause problems for someone with a weak conscience , just because you have the right to eat anything .
46008010	You know all this , and so it doesn't bother you to eat in the temple of an idol . But suppose a person with a weak conscience sees you and decides to eat food that has been offered to idols .
46008011	Then what you know has destroyed someone Christ died for .
46008012	When you sin by hurting a follower with a weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
46008013	So if I hurt one of the Lord's followers by what I eat , I will never eat meat as long as I live .
46009001	I am free . I am an apostle . I have seen the Lord Jesus and have led you to have faith in him .
46009002	Others may think that I am not an apostle , but you are proof that I am an apostle to you .
46009003	When people question me , I tell them
46009004	that Barnabas and I have the right to our food and drink .
46009005	We each have the right to marry one of the Lord's followers and to take her along with us , just as the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Peter do .
46009006	Are we the only ones who have to support ourselves by working at another job ?
46009007	Do soldiers pay their own salaries ? Don't people who raise grapes eat some of what they grow ? Don't shepherds get milk from their own goats ?
46009010	No , he wasn't ! He was talking about us . This was written in the Scriptures so that all who plow and all who grind the grain will look forward to sharing in the harvest .
46009011	When we told the message to you , it was like planting spiritual seed . So we have the right to accept material things as our harvest from you .
46009012	If others have the right to do this , we have an even greater right . But we haven't used this right of ours . We are willing to put up with anything to keep from causing trouble for the message about Christ .
46009013	Don't you know that people who work in the temple make their living from what is brought to the temple ? Don't you know that a person who serves at the altar is given part of what is offered ?
46009014	In the same way , the Lord wants everyone who preaches the good news to make a living from preaching this message .
46009015	But I have never used these privileges of mine , and I am not writing this because I want to start now . I would rather die than have someone rob me of the right to take pride in this .
46009016	I don't have any reason to brag about preaching the good news . Preaching is something God told me to do , and if I don't do it , I am doomed .
46009017	If I preach because I want to , I will be paid . But even if I don't want to , it is still something God has sent me to do .
46009018	What pay am I given ? It is the chance to preach the good news free of charge and not to use the privileges that are mine because I am a preacher .
46009019	I am not anyone's slave . But I have become a slave to everyone , so I can win as many people as possible .
46009020	When I am with the Jews , I live like a Jew to win Jews . They are ruled by the Law of Moses , and I am not . But I live by the Law to win them .
46009021	And when I am with people who are not ruled by the Law , I forget about the Law to win them . Of course , I never really forget about the law of God . In fact , I am ruled by the law of Christ .
46009022	When I am with people whose faith is weak , I live as they do to win them . I do everything I can to win everyone I possibly can .
46009023	I do all this for the good news , because I want to share in its blessings .
46009024	You know that many runners enter a race , and only one of them wins the prize . So run to win !
46009025	Athletes work hard to win a crown that cannot last , but we do it for a crown that will last forever .
46009026	I don't run without a goal . And I don't box by beating my fists in the air .
46009027	I keep my body under control and make it my slave , so I won't lose out after telling the good news to others .
46010001	Friends , I want to remind you that all our ancestors walked under the cloud and went through the sea .
46010002	This was like being baptized and becoming followers of Moses .
46010003	All of them also ate the same spiritual food
46010004	and drank the same spiritual drink , which flowed from the spiritual rock that followed them . That rock was Christ .
46010005	But most of them did not please God . So they died , and their bodies were scattered all over the desert .
46010006	What happened to them is a warning to keep us from wanting to do the same evil things .
46010007	They worshiped idols , just as the Scriptures say , “ The people sat down to eat and drink . Then they got up to dance around . ” So don't worship idols .
46010008	Some of those people did shameful things , and in a single day about 23,000 died . Don't do shameful things as they did .
46010009	And don't try to test Christ , as some of them did and were later bitten by poisonous snakes .
46010010	Don't even grumble , as some of them did and were killed by the destroying angel .
46010011	These things happened to them as a warning to us . All this was written in the Scriptures to teach us who live in these last days .
46010012	Even if you think you can stand up to temptation , be careful not to fall .
46010013	You are tempted in the same way that everyone else is tempted . But God can be trusted not to let you be tempted too much , and he will show you how to escape from your temptations .
46010014	My friends , you must keep away from idols .
46010015	I am speaking to you as people who have enough sense to know what I am talking about .
46010016	When we drink from the cup we ask God to bless , isn't that sharing in the blood of Christ ? When we eat the bread we break , isn't that sharing in the body of Christ ?
46010017	By sharing in the same loaf of bread , we become one body , even though there are many of us .
46010018	Aren't the people of Israel sharing in the worship when they gather around the altar and eat the sacrifices offered there ?
46010019	Am I saying that either the idols or the food sacrificed to them is anything at all ?
46010020	No , I am not ! This food is really sacrificed to demons and not to God . I don't want you to have anything to do with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink from the cup of demons and still drink from the Lord's cup . You cannot eat at the table of demons and still eat at the Lord's table .
46010022	We would make the Lord jealous if we did this . And we are not stronger than the Lord .
46010023	Some of you say , “ We can do whatever we want to ! ” But I tell you not everything may be good or helpful .
46010024	We should think about others and not about ourselves .
46010025	However , when you buy meat in the market , go ahead and eat it . Keep your conscience clear by not asking where the meat came from .
46010026	The Scriptures say , “ The earth and everything in it belong to the Lord . ”
46010027	If an unbeliever invites you to dinner , and you want to go , then go . Eat whatever you are served . Don't cause a problem for someone's conscience by asking where the food came from .
46010030	If I give thanks for what I eat , why should anyone accuse me of doing wrong ?
46010031	When you eat or drink or do anything else , always do it to honor God .
46010032	Don't cause problems for Jews or Greeks or anyone else who belongs to God's church .
46010033	I always try to please others instead of myself , in the hope that many of them will be saved .
46011002	I am proud of you , because you always remember me and obey the teachings I gave you .
46011003	Now I want you to know that Christ is the head of all men , and a man is the head of a woman . But God is the head of Christ .
46011004	This means that any man who prays or prophesies with something on his head brings shame to his head .
46011005	But any woman who prays or prophesies without something on her head brings shame to her head . In fact , she may as well shave her head .
46011006	A woman should wear something on her head . It is a disgrace for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair . But if she refuses to wear something on her head , let her cut off her hair .
46011007	Men were created to be like God and to bring honor to God . This means a man should not wear anything on his head . Women were created to bring honor to men .
46011008	It was the woman who was made from a man , and not the man who was made from a woman .
46011009	He wasn't created for her . She was created for him .
46011010	And so , because of this , and also because of the angels , a woman ought to wear something on her head , as a sign of her authority .
46011011	As far as the Lord is concerned , men and women need each other .
46011012	It is true that the first woman came from a man , but all other men have been given birth by women . Yet God is the one who created everything .
46011013	Ask yourselves if it is proper for a woman to pray without something on her head .
46011014	Isn't it unnatural and disgraceful for men to have long hair ?
46011015	But long hair is a beautiful way for a woman to cover her head .
46011016	This is how things are done in all of God's churches , and this is why none of you should argue about what I have said .
46011017	Your worship services do you more harm than good . I am certainly not going to praise you for this .
46011018	I am told you can't get along with each other when you worship , and I am sure that some of what I have heard is true .
46011019	You are bound to argue with each other , but it is easy to see which of you have God's approval .
46011020	When you meet together , you don't really celebrate the Lord's Supper .
46011021	You even start eating before everyone gets to the meeting , and some of you go hungry , while others get drunk .
46011022	Don't you have homes where you can eat and drink ? Do you hate God's church ? Do you want to embarrass people who don't have anything ? What can I say to you ? I certainly cannot praise you .
46011023	I have already told you what the Lord Jesus did on the night he was betrayed . And it came from the Lord himself .
46011026	The Lord meant that when you eat this bread and drink from this cup , you tell about his death until he comes .
46011027	But if you eat the bread and drink the wine in a way that isn't worthy of the Lord , you sin against his body and blood .
46011028	This is why you must examine the way you eat and drink .
46011029	If you fail to understand that you are the body of the Lord , you will condemn yourselves by the way you eat and drink .
46011030	This is why many of you are sick and weak and why a lot of others have died .
46011031	If we carefully judge ourselves , we won't be punished .
46011032	But when the Lord judges and punishes us , he does it to keep us from being condemned with the rest of the world .
46011033	My dear friends , you should wait until everyone gets there before you start eating .
46011034	If you really are hungry , you can eat at home . Then you won't condemn yourselves when you meet together . After I arrive , I will instruct you about the other matters .
46012001	My friends , you asked me about spiritual gifts .
46012002	I want you to remember that before you became followers of the Lord , you were led in all the wrong ways by idols that cannot even talk .
46012003	Now I want you to know that if you are led by God's Spirit , you will say that Jesus is Lord , and you will never curse Jesus .
46012004	There are different kinds of spiritual gifts , but they all come from the same Spirit .
46012005	There are different ways to serve the same Lord ,
46012006	and we can each do different things . Yet the same God works in all of us and helps us in everything we do .
46012007	The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others .
46012008	Some of us can speak with wisdom , while others can speak with knowledge , but these gifts come from the same Spirit .
46012009	To others the Spirit has given great faith or the power to heal the sick
46012010	or the power to work mighty miracles . Some of us are prophets , and some of us recognize when God's Spirit is present . Others can speak different kinds of languages , and still others can tell what these languages mean .
46012011	But it is the Spirit who does all this and decides which gifts to give to each of us .
46012012	The body of Christ has many different parts , just as any other body does .
46012013	Some of us are Jews , and others are Gentiles . Some of us are slaves , and others are free . But God's Spirit baptized each of us and made us part of the body of Christ . Now we each drink from that same Spirit .
46012014	Our bodies don't have just one part . They have many parts .
46012015	Suppose a foot says , “ I'm not a hand , and so I'm not part of the body . ” Wouldn't the foot still belong to the body ?
46012016	Or suppose an ear says , “ I'm not an eye , and so I'm not part of the body . ” Wouldn't the ear still belong to the body ?
46012017	If our bodies were only an eye , we couldn't hear a thing . And if they were only an ear , we couldn't smell a thing .
46012018	But God has put all parts of our body together in the way that he decided is best .
46012019	A body isn't really a body , unless there is more than one part .
46012020	It takes many parts to make a single body .
46012021	That's why the eyes cannot say they don't need the hands . That's also why the head cannot say it doesn't need the feet .
46012022	In fact , we cannot get along without the parts of the body that seem to be the weakest .
46012023	We take special care to dress up some parts of our bodies . We are modest about our personal parts ,
46012024	but we don't have to be modest about other parts . God put our bodies together in such a way that even the parts that seem the least important are valuable .
46012025	He did this to make all parts of the body work together smoothly , with each part caring about the others .
46012026	If one part of our body hurts , we hurt all over . If one part of our body is honored , the whole body will be happy .
46012027	Together you are the body of Christ . Each one of you is part of his body .
46012028	First , God chose some people to be apostles and prophets and teachers for the church . But he also chose some to work miracles or heal the sick or help others or be leaders or speak different kinds of languages .
46012029	Not everyone is an apostle . Not everyone is a prophet . Not everyone is a teacher . Not everyone can work miracles .
46012030	Not everyone can heal the sick . Not everyone can speak different kinds of languages . Not everyone can tell what these languages mean .
46012031	I want you to desire the best gifts . So I will show you a much better way .
46013001	What if I could speak all languages of humans and even of angels ? If I did not love others , I would be nothing more than a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	What if I could prophesy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge ? And what if I had faith that moved mountains ? I would be nothing , unless I loved others .
46013003	What if I gave away all that I owned and let myself be burned alive ? I would gain nothing , unless I loved others .
46013004	Love is patient and kind , never jealous , boastful , proud , or
46013005	rude . Love isn't selfish or quick tempered . It doesn't keep a record of wrongs that others do .
46013006	Love rejoices in the truth , but not in evil .
46013007	Love is always supportive , loyal , hopeful , and trusting .
46013008	Love never fails ! Everyone who prophesies will stop , and unknown languages will no longer be spoken . All that we know will be forgotten .
46013009	We don't know everything , and our prophecies are not complete .
46013010	But what is perfect will someday appear , and what isn't perfect will then disappear .
46013011	When we were children , we thought and reasoned as children do . But when we grew up , we quit our childish ways .
46013012	Now all we can see of God is like a cloudy picture in a mirror . Later we will see him face to face . We don't know everything , but then we will , just as God completely understands us .
46013013	For now there are faith , hope , and love . But of these three , the greatest is love .
46014001	Love should be your guide . Be eager to have the gifts that come from the Holy Spirit , especially the gift of prophecy .
46014002	If you speak languages that others don't know , God will understand what you are saying , though no one else will know what you mean . You will be talking about mysteries that only the Spirit understands .
46014003	But when you prophesy , you will be understood , and others will be helped . They will be encouraged and made to feel better .
46014004	By speaking languages that others don't know , you help only yourself . But by prophesying you help everyone in the church .
46014005	I am glad for you to speak unknown languages , although I prefer that you would prophesy . In fact , prophesying does much more good than speaking unknown languages , unless someone can help the church by explaining what you mean .
46014006	My friends , what good would it do , if I came and spoke unknown languages to you and didn't explain what I meant ? How would I help you , unless I told you what God had shown me or gave you some knowledge or prophecy or teaching ?
46014007	If all musical instruments sounded alike , how would you know the difference between a flute and a harp ?
46014008	If a bugle call isn't clear , how would you know to get ready for battle ?
46014009	This is how it is when you speak unknown languages . If no one can understand what you are talking about , you will only be talking to the wind .
46014010	There are many different languages in this world , and all of them make sense .
46014011	But if I don't understand the language that someone is using , we will be like foreigners to each other .
46014012	If you really want spiritual gifts , choose the ones that will be most helpful to the church .
46014013	When we speak languages that others don't know , we should pray for the power to explain what we mean .
46014014	For example , if I use an unknown language in my prayers , my spirit prays but my mind is useless .
46014015	Then what should I do ? There are times when I should pray with my spirit , and times when I should pray with my mind . Sometimes I should sing with my spirit , and at other times I should sing with my mind .
46014016	Suppose some strangers are in your worship service , when you are praising God with your spirit . If they don't understand you , how will they know to say , “ Amen ” ?
46014017	You may be worshiping God in a wonderful way , but no one else will be helped .
46014018	I thank God that I speak unknown languages more than any of you .
46014019	But words that make sense can help the church . This is why in church I would rather speak five words that make sense than to speak 10,000 words in a language that others don't know .
46014020	My friends , stop thinking like children . Think like mature people and be as innocent as tiny babies .
46014021	In the Scriptures the Lord says , “ I will use strangers who speak unknown languages to talk to my people . They will speak to them in foreign languages , but still my people won't listen to me . ”
46014022	Languages others don't know may mean something to unbelievers , but not to the Lord's followers . Prophecy , on the other hand , is for followers , not for unbelievers .
46014023	Suppose everyone in your worship service started speaking unknown languages , and some outsiders or some unbelievers come in . Won't they think you are crazy ?
46014024	But suppose all of you are prophesying when those unbelievers and outsiders come in . They will realize that they are sinners , and they will want to change their ways because of what you are saying .
46014025	They will tell what is hidden in their hearts . Then they will kneel down and say to God , “ We are certain that you are with these people . ”
46014026	My friends , when you meet to worship , you must do everything for the good of everyone there . That's how it should be when someone sings or teaches or tells what God has said or speaks an unknown language or explains what the language means .
46014027	No more than two or three of you should speak unknown languages during the meeting . You must take turns , and someone should always be there to explain what you mean .
46014028	If no one can explain , you must keep silent in church and speak only to yourself and to God .
46014029	Two or three persons may prophesy , and everyone else must listen carefully .
46014030	If someone sitting there receives a message from God , the speaker must stop and let the other person speak .
46014031	Let only one person speak at a time , then all of you will learn something and be encouraged .
46014032	A prophet should be willing to stop and let someone else speak .
46014033	God wants everything to be done peacefully and in order . When God's people meet in church ,
46014034	the women must not be allowed to speak . They must keep quiet and listen , as the Law of Moses teaches .
46014035	If there is something they want to know , they can ask their husbands when they get home . It is disgraceful for women to speak in church .
46014036	God's message did not start with you people , and you are not the only ones it has reached .
46014037	If you think of yourself as a prophet or a spiritual person , you will know I am writing only what the Lord has commanded .
46014038	So don't pay attention to anyone who ignores what I am writing .
46014039	My friends , be eager to prophesy and don't stop anyone from speaking languages that others don't know .
46014040	But do everything properly and in order .
46015001	My friends , I want you to remember the message I preached and that you believed and trusted .
46015002	You will be saved by this message , if you hold firmly to it . But if you don't , your faith was all for nothing .
46015003	I told you the most important part of the message exactly as it was told to me . This part is : Christ died for our sins , as the Scriptures say .
46015004	He was buried , and three days later he was raised to life , as the Scriptures say .
46015005	Christ appeared to Peter , then to the twelve .
46015006	After this , he appeared to more than five hundred other followers . Most of them are still alive , but some have died .
46015007	He also appeared to James , then to all of the apostles .
46015008	Finally , he appeared to me , even though I am like someone who was born at the wrong time .
46015009	I am the least important of all the apostles . In fact , I caused so much trouble for God's church that I don't even deserve to be called an apostle .
46015010	But God treated me with undeserved grace ! He made me what I am , and his grace wasn't wasted . I worked much harder than any of the other apostles , although it was really God's grace at work and not me .
46015011	But it doesn't matter if I preached or if they preached . All of you believed the message just the same .
46015012	If we preach that Christ was raised from death , how can some of you say the dead will not be raised to life ?
46015013	If they won't be raised to life , Christ himself wasn't raised to life .
46015014	And if Christ wasn't raised to life , our message is worthless , and so is your faith .
46015015	If the dead won't be raised to life , we have told lies about God by saying he raised Christ to life , when he really did not .
46015016	So if the dead won't be raised to life , Christ wasn't raised to life .
46015017	Unless Christ was raised to life , your faith is useless , and you are still living in your sins .
46015018	And those people who died after putting their faith in him are completely lost .
46015019	If our hope in Christ is good only for this life , we are worse off than anyone else .
46015020	But Christ has been raised to life ! And he makes us certain that others will also be raised to life .
46015021	Just as we will die because of Adam , we will be raised to life because of Christ .
46015022	Adam brought death to all of us , and Christ will bring life to all of us .
46015023	But we must each wait our turn . Christ was the first to be raised to life , and his people will be raised to life when he returns .
46015024	Then after Christ has destroyed all powers and forces , the end will come , and he will give the kingdom to God the Father .
46015025	Christ will rule until he puts all his enemies under his power ,
46015026	and the last enemy he destroys will be death .
46015027	When the Scriptures say he will put everything under his power , they don't include God . It was God who put everything under the power of Christ .
46015028	After everything is under the power of God's Son , he will put himself under the power of God , who put everything under his Son's power . Then God will mean everything to everyone .
46015029	If the dead are not going to be raised to life , what will people do who are being baptized for them ? Why are they being baptized for those dead people ?
46015030	And why do we always risk our lives
46015031	and face death every day ? The pride that I have in you because of Christ Jesus our Lord is what makes me say this .
46015032	What do you think I gained by fighting wild animals in Ephesus ? If the dead are not raised to life , “ Let's eat and drink . Tomorrow we die . ”
46015035	Some of you have asked , “ How will the dead be raised to life ? What kind of bodies will they have ? ”
46015036	Don't be foolish . A seed must die before it can sprout from the ground .
46015037	Wheat seeds and all other seeds look different from the sprouts that come up .
46015038	This is because God gives everything the kind of body he wants it to have .
46015039	People , animals , birds , and fish are each made of flesh , but none of them are alike .
46015040	Everything in the heavens has a body , and so does everything on earth . But each one is very different from all the others .
46015041	The sun isn't like the moon , the moon isn't like the stars , and each star is different .
46015042	That's how it will be when our bodies are raised to life . These bodies will die , but the bodies that are raised will live forever .
46015043	These ugly and weak bodies will become beautiful and strong .
46015044	As surely as there are physical bodies , there are spiritual bodies . And our physical bodies will be changed into spiritual bodies .
46015045	The first man was named Adam , and the Scriptures tell us that he was a living person . But Jesus , who may be called the last Adam , is a life-giving spirit .
46015046	We see that the one with a spiritual body did not come first . He came after the one who had a physical body .
46015047	The first man was made from the dust of the earth , but the second man came from heaven .
46015048	Everyone on earth has a body like the body of the one who was made from the dust of the earth . And everyone in heaven has a body like the body of the one who came from heaven .
46015049	Just as we are like the one who was made out of earth , we will be like the one who came from heaven .
46015050	My friends , I want you to know that our bodies of flesh and blood will decay . This means they cannot share in God's kingdom , which lasts forever .
46015051	I will explain a mystery to you . Not every one of us will die , but we will all be changed .
46015052	It will happen suddenly , quicker than the blink of an eye . At the sound of the last trumpet the dead will be raised . We will all be changed , so we will never die again .
46015053	Our dead and decaying bodies will be changed into bodies that won't die or decay .
46015054	The bodies we now have are weak and can die . But they will be changed into bodies that are eternal . Then the Scriptures will come true , “ Death has lost the battle !
46015055	Where is its victory ? Where is its sting ? ”
46015058	My dear friends , stand firm and don't be shaken . Always keep busy working for the Lord . You know that everything you do for him is worthwhile .
46016001	When you collect money for God's people , I want you to do exactly what I told the churches in Galatia to do .
46016002	That is , each Sunday each of you must put aside part of what you have earned . If you do this , you won't have to take up a collection when I come .
46016003	Choose some followers to take the money to Jerusalem . I will send them on with the money and with letters which show that you approve of them .
46016004	If you think I should go along , they can go with me .
46016005	After I have gone through Macedonia , I hope to see you
46016006	and visit with you for a while . I may even stay all winter , so that you can help me on my way to wherever I will be going next .
46016007	If the Lord lets me , I would rather come later for a longer visit than to stop off now for only a short visit .
46016008	I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	because there is a wonderful opportunity for me to do some work here . But there are also many people who are against me .
46016010	When Timothy arrives , give him a friendly welcome . He is doing the Lord's work , just as I am .
46016011	Don't let anyone mistreat him . I am looking for him to return to me together with the other followers . So when he leaves , send him off with your blessings .
46016012	I have tried hard to get our friend Apollos to visit you with the other followers . He doesn't want to come just now , but he will come when he can .
46016013	Keep alert . Be firm in your faith . Stay brave and strong .
46016014	Show love in everything you do .
46016015	You know that Stephanas and his family were the first in Achaia to have faith in the Lord . They have done all they can for God's people . My friends , I ask you
46016016	to obey leaders like them and to do the same for all others who work hard with you .
46016017	I was glad to see Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus . Having them here was like having you .
46016018	They made me feel much better , just as they made you feel better . You should appreciate people like them .
46016019	Greetings from the churches in Asia . Aquila and Priscilla , together with the church that meets in their house , send greetings in the name of the Lord .
46016020	All the Lord's followers send their greetings . Give each other a warm greeting .
46016021	I am signing this letter myself : PAUL .
46016022	I pray that God will put a curse on everyone who doesn't love the Lord . And may the Lord come soon .
46016023	I pray the Lord Jesus will be kind to you .
46016024	I love everyone who belongs to Christ Jesus .
47001001	From Paul , chosen by God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ , and from Timothy , who is also a follower . To God's church in Corinth and to all of God's people in Achaia .
47001002	I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
47001003	Praise God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! The Father is a merciful God , who always gives us comfort .
47001004	He comforts us when we are in trouble , so that we can share this same comfort with others in trouble .
47001005	We share in the terrible sufferings of Christ , but also in the wonderful comfort he gives .
47001006	We suffer in the hope that you will be comforted and saved . And because we are comforted , you will also be comforted , as you patiently endure suffering like ours .
47001007	You never disappoint us . You suffered as much as we did , and we know that you will be comforted as we were .
47001008	My friends , I want you to know what a hard time we had in Asia . Our sufferings were so horrible and so unbearable that death seemed certain .
47001009	In fact , we felt sure we were going to die . But this made us stop trusting in ourselves and start trusting God , who raises the dead to life .
47001010	God saved us from the threat of death , and we are sure that he will do it again and again .
47001011	Please help us by praying for us . Then many people will give thanks for the blessings we receive in answer to all these prayers .
47001012	We can be proud of our clear conscience . We have always lived honestly and sincerely , especially when we were with you . And we were guided by God's gift of undeserved grace instead of by the wisdom of this world .
47001013	I am not writing anything you cannot read and understand . I hope you will understand it completely ,
47001014	just as you already partly understand us . Then when our Lord Jesus returns , you can be as proud of us as we are of you .
47001015	I was so sure of your pride in us that I had planned to visit you first of all . In this way you would have the blessing of two visits from me
47001016	once on my way to Macedonia and again on my return from there . Then you could send me on to Judea .
47001017	Do you think I couldn't make up my mind about what to do ? Or do I seem like someone who says “ Yes ” or “ No ” simply to please others ?
47001018	God can be trusted , and so can I , when I say our answer to you has always been “ Yes ” and never “ No . ”
47001019	This is because Jesus Christ the Son of God is always “ Yes ” and never “ No . ” And he is the one Silas , Timothy , and I told you about .
47001020	Christ says “ Yes ” to all God's promises . This is why we have Christ to say “ Amen ” for us to the glory of God .
47001021	And so God makes it possible for you and us to stand firmly together with Christ . God is also the one who chose us
47001022	and put his Spirit in our hearts to show that we belong only to him .
47001023	God is my witness that I stayed away from Corinth , just to keep from being hard on you .
47001024	We are not bosses who tell you what to believe . We are working with you to make you glad , because your faith is strong .
47002001	I have decided not to make my next visit with you so painful .
47002002	If I make you feel bad , who would be left to cheer me up , except the people I had made to feel bad ?
47002003	The reason I want to be happy is to make you happy . I wrote as I did because I didn't want to visit you and be made to feel bad , when you should make me feel happy .
47002004	At the time I wrote , I was suffering terribly . My eyes were full of tears , and my heart was broken . But I didn't want to make you feel bad . I only wanted to let you know how much I cared for you .
47002005	I don't want to be hard on you . But if one of you has made someone feel bad , I am not really the one who has been made to feel bad . Some of you are the ones .
47002006	Most of you have already pointed out the wrong that person did , and this is punishment enough for what was done .
47002007	When people sin , you should forgive and comfort them , so they won't give up in despair .
47002008	You should make them sure of your love for them .
47002009	I also wrote because I wanted to test you and find out if you would follow my instructions .
47002010	I will forgive anyone you forgive . Yes , for your sake and with Christ as my witness , I have forgiven whatever needed to be forgiven .
47002011	I have done this to keep Satan from getting the better of us . We all know what goes on in his mind .
47002012	When I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ , I found that the Lord had already prepared the way .
47002013	But I was worried when I didn't find my friend Titus there . So I left the other followers and went on to Macedonia .
47002014	I am grateful that God always makes it possible for Christ to lead us to victory . God also helps us spread the knowledge about Christ everywhere , and this knowledge is like the smell of perfume .
47002017	A lot of people try to get rich from preaching God's message . But we are God's sincere messengers , and by the power of Christ we speak our message with God as our witness .
47003001	Are we once again bragging about ourselves ? Do we need letters to you or from you to tell others about us ? Some people do need letters telling about them .
47003002	But you are our letter , and you are in our hearts for everyone to read and understand .
47003003	You are like a letter written by Christ and delivered by us . But you are not written with pen and ink or on tablets made of stone . You are written in our hearts by the Spirit of the living God .
47003004	We are sure about all this . Christ makes us sure in the very presence of God .
47003005	We don't have the right to claim that we have done anything on our own . God gives us what it takes to do all we do .
47003006	He makes us worthy to be the servants of his new agreement that comes from the Holy Spirit and not from a written Law . After all , the Law brings death , but the Spirit brings life .
47003007	The Law of Moses brought only the promise of death , even though it was carved on stones and given in a wonderful way . Still the Law made Moses' face shine so brightly the people of Israel could not look at it , even though it was a fading glory .
47003008	So won't the agreement the Spirit brings to us be even more wonderful ?
47003009	If something that brings the death sentence is glorious , won't something that makes us acceptable to God be even more glorious ?
47003010	In fact , the new agreement is so wonderful that the Law is no longer glorious at all .
47003011	The Law was given with a glory that faded away . But the glory of the new agreement is much greater , because it will never fade away .
47003012	This wonderful hope makes us feel like speaking freely .
47003013	We are not like Moses . His face was shining , but he covered it to keep the people of Israel from seeing the brightness fade away .
47003014	The people were stubborn , and something still keeps them from seeing the truth when the Law is read . Only Christ can take away the covering that keeps them from seeing .
47003015	When the Law of Moses is read , they have their minds covered over
47003016	with a covering that is removed only for those who turn to the Lord .
47003017	The Lord and the Spirit are one and the same , and the Lord's Spirit sets us free .
47003018	So our faces are not covered . They show the bright glory of the Lord , as the Lord's Spirit makes us more and more like our glorious Lord .
47004001	God has been kind enough to trust us with this work . This is why we never give up .
47004002	We don't do shameful things that must be kept secret . And we don't try to fool anyone or twist God's message around . God is our witness that we speak only the truth , so others will be sure we can be trusted .
47004003	If there is anything hidden about our message , it is hidden only to someone who is lost .
47004004	The god who rules this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers . They cannot see the light , which is the good news about our glorious Christ , who shows what God is like .
47004005	We are not preaching about ourselves . Our message is that Jesus Christ is Lord . He also sent us to be your servants .
47004006	The Scriptures say , “ God commanded light to shine in the dark . ” Now God is shining in our hearts to let you know that his glory is seen in Jesus Christ .
47004007	We are like clay jars in which this treasure is stored . The real power comes from God and not from us .
47004008	We often suffer , but we are never crushed . Even when we don't know what to do , we never give up .
47004009	In times of trouble , God is with us , and when we are knocked down , we get up again .
47004012	This means that death is working in us , but life is working in you .
47004013	In the Scriptures it says , “ I spoke because I had faith . ” We have this same kind of faith . So we speak
47004014	because we know that God raised the Lord Jesus to life . And just as God raised Jesus , he will also raise us to life . Then he will bring us into his presence together with you .
47004015	All of this has been done for you , so more and more people will know how kind God is and will praise and honor him .
47004016	We never give up . Our bodies are gradually dying , but we ourselves are being made stronger each day .
47004017	These little troubles are getting us ready for an eternal glory that will make all our troubles seem like nothing .
47004018	Things that are seen don't last forever , but things that are not seen are eternal . This is why we keep our minds on the things that cannot be seen .
47005001	Our bodies are like tents that we live in here on earth . But when these tents are destroyed , we know that God will give each of us a place to live . These homes will not be buildings someone has made , but they are in heaven and will last forever .
47005002	While we are here on earth , we sigh because we want to live in that heavenly home .
47005003	We want to put it on like clothes and not be naked .
47005004	These tents we now live in are like a heavy burden , and we groan . But we don't do this just because we want to leave these bodies that will die . It is because we want to change them for bodies that will never die .
47005005	God is the one who makes all this possible . He has given us his Spirit to make us certain he will do it .
47005006	So always be cheerful ! As long as we are in these bodies , we are away from the Lord .
47005007	But we live by faith , not by what we see .
47005008	We should be cheerful , because we would rather leave these bodies and be at home with the Lord .
47005009	But whether we are at home with the Lord or away from him , we still try our best to please him .
47005010	After all , Christ will judge each of us for the good or the bad that we do while living in these bodies .
47005011	We know what it means to respect the Lord , and we encourage everyone to turn to him . God himself knows what we are like , and I hope you also know what kind of people we are .
47005012	We are not trying once more to brag about ourselves . But we want you to be proud of us , when you are with those who are not sincere and brag about what others think of them .
47005013	If we seem out of our minds , it is between God and us . But if we are in our right minds , it is for your good .
47005014	We are ruled by Christ's love for us . We are certain that if one person died for everyone else , then all of us have died .
47005015	And Christ did die for all of us . He died so we would no longer live for ourselves , but for the one who died and was raised to life for us .
47005016	We are careful not to judge people by what they seem to be , though we once judged Christ in this way .
47005017	Anyone who belongs to Christ is a new person . The past is forgotten , and everything is new .
47005018	God has done it all ! He sent Christ to make peace between himself and us , and he has given us the work of making peace between himself and others .
47005019	What we mean is that God was in Christ , offering peace and forgiveness to the people of this world . And he has given us the work of sharing his message about peace .
47005020	We were sent to speak for Christ , and God is begging you to listen to our message . We speak for Christ and sincerely ask you to make peace with God .
47005021	Christ never sinned ! But God treated him as a sinner , so Christ could make us acceptable to God .
47006001	We work together with God , and we beg you to make good use of God's gift of undeserved grace .
47006002	In the Scriptures God says , “ When the time came , I listened to you , and when you needed help , I came to save you . ”
47006003	We don't want anyone to find fault with our work , and so we try hard not to cause problems .
47006004	But in everything and in every way we show we truly are God's servants . We have always been patient , though we have had a lot of trouble , suffering , and hard times .
47006005	We have been beaten , put in jail , and hurt in riots . We have worked hard and have gone without sleep or food .
47006006	But we have kept ourselves pure and have been understanding , patient , and kind . The Holy Spirit has been with us , and our love has been real .
47006007	We have spoken the truth , and God's power has worked in us . In all our struggles we have said and done only what is right .
47006008	Whether we were honored or dishonored or praised or cursed , we always told the truth about ourselves . But some people said we did not .
47006009	We are unknown to others , but well known to you . We seem to be dying , and yet we are still alive . We have been punished , but never killed ,
47006010	and we are always happy , even in times of suffering . Although we are poor , we have made many people rich . And though we own nothing , everything is ours .
47006011	Friends in Corinth , we are telling the truth when we say there is room in our hearts for you .
47006012	We are not holding back on our love for you , but you are holding back on your love for us .
47006013	I speak to you as I would speak to my own children . Please make room in your hearts for us .
47006014	Stay away from people who are not followers of the Lord ! Can someone who is good get along with someone who is evil ? Are light and darkness the same ?
47006015	Is Christ a friend of Satan ? Can people who follow the Lord have anything in common with those who don't ?
47006016	Do idols belong in the temple of God ? We are the temple of the living God , as God himself says , “ I will live with these people and walk among them . I will be their God , and they will be my people . ”
47006017	The Lord also says , “ Leave them and stay away ! Don't touch anything that isn't clean . Then I will welcome you
47006018	and be your Father . You will be my sons and my daughters , as surely as I am God , the All-Powerful . ”
47007001	My friends , God has made us these promises . So we should stay away from everything that keeps our bodies and spirits from being clean . We should honor God and try to be completely like him .
47007002	Make a place for us in your hearts ! We haven't mistreated or hurt anyone . We haven't cheated anyone .
47007003	I am not saying this to be hard on you . But , as I have said before , you will always be in our thoughts , whether we live or die .
47007004	I trust you completely . I am always proud of you , and I am greatly encouraged . In all my trouble I am still very happy .
47007005	After we came to Macedonia , we didn't have any chance to rest . We were faced with all kinds of problems . We were troubled by enemies and troubled by fears .
47007006	But God cheers up people in need , and this is what he did when he sent Titus to us .
47007007	Of course , we were glad to see Titus , but what really made us glad is the way you cheered him up . He told how sorry you were and how concerned you were about me . And this made me even happier .
47007008	I don't feel bad anymore , even though my letter hurt your feelings . I did feel bad at first , but I don't now . I know that the letter hurt you for a while .
47007009	Now I am happy , but not because I hurt your feelings . It is because God used your hurt feelings to make you turn back to him , and none of you were harmed by us .
47007010	When God makes you feel sorry enough to turn to him and be saved , you don't have anything to feel bad about . But when this world makes you feel sorry , it can cause your death .
47007011	Just look what God has done by making you feel sorry ! You sincerely want to prove you are innocent . You are angry . You are shocked . You are eager to see that justice is done . You have proved that you were completely right in this matter .
47007012	When I wrote you , it wasn't to accuse the one who was wrong or to take up for the one who was hurt . I wrote , so God would show you how much you do care for us .
47007013	And we were greatly encouraged . Although we were encouraged , we felt even better when we saw how happy Titus was , because you had shown he had nothing to worry about .
47007014	We had told him how much we thought of you , and you did not disappoint us . Just as we have always told you the truth , so everything we told him about you has also proved to be true .
47007015	Titus loves all of you very much , especially when he remembers how you obeyed him and how you trembled with fear when you welcomed him .
47007016	It makes me really glad to know I can depend on you .
47008001	My friends , we want you to know that the churches in Macedonia have shown others God's gift of undeserved grace .
47008002	Although they were going through hard times and were very poor , they were glad to give generously .
47008003	They gave as much as they could afford and even more , simply because they wanted to .
47008004	They even asked and begged us to let them have the joy of giving their money for God's people .
47008005	And they did more than we had hoped . They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us , just as God wanted them to do .
47008006	Titus was the one who got you started doing this good thing , so we begged him to help you finish what you had begun .
47008007	You do everything better than anyone else . You have stronger faith . You speak better and know more . You are eager to give , and you love us better . Now you must give more generously than anyone else .
47008008	I am not ordering you to do this . I am simply testing how real your love is by comparing it with the concern that others have shown .
47008009	You know our Lord Jesus Christ treated us with undeserved grace by giving up all his riches , so you could become rich .
47008010	A year ago you were the first ones to give , and you gave because you wanted to . So listen to my advice .
47008011	I think you should finish what you started . If you give according to what you have , you will prove you are as eager to give as you were to think about giving .
47008012	It doesn't matter how much you have . What matters is how much you are willing to give from what you have .
47008013	I am not trying to make life easier for others by making life harder for you . But it is only fair
47008014	for you to share with them when you have so much , and they have so little . Later , when they have more than enough , and you are in need , they can share with you . Then everyone will have a fair share ,
47008015	just as the Scriptures say , “ Those who gathered too much had nothing left . Those who gathered only a little had all they needed . ”
47008016	I am grateful that God made Titus care as much about you as we do .
47008017	When we begged Titus to visit you , he said he would . He wanted to because he cared so much for you .
47008018	With Titus we are also sending one of the Lord's followers who is well known in every church for spreading the good news .
47008019	The churches chose this follower to travel with us while we carry this gift that will bring praise to the Lord and show how much we hope to help .
47008020	We don't want anyone to find fault with the way we handle your generous gift .
47008021	But we want to do what pleases the Lord and what people think is right .
47008022	We are also sending someone else with Titus and the other follower . We approve of this man . In fact , he has already shown us many times that he wants to help . And now he wants to help even more than ever , because he trusts you so much .
47008023	Titus is my partner , who works with me to serve you . The other two followers are sent by the churches , and they bring honor to Christ .
47008024	Treat them in such a way that the churches will see your love and will know why we bragged about you .
47009001	I don't need to write you about the money you plan to give for God's people .
47009002	I know how eager you are to give . And I have proudly told the Lord's followers in Macedonia that you people in Achaia have been ready for a whole year . Now your desire to give has made them want to give .
47009003	This is why I am sending Titus and the two others to you . I want you to be ready , just as I promised . This will prove we were not wrong to brag about you .
47009004	Some followers from Macedonia may come with me , and I want them to find that you have the money ready . If you don't , I would be embarrassed for trusting you to do this . But you would be embarrassed even more .
47009005	So I have decided to ask Titus and the others to spend some time with you before I arrive . This way they can arrange to collect the money you have promised . Then you will have the chance to give because you want to , and not because you feel forced to .
47009006	Remember this saying , “ A few seeds make a small harvest , but a lot of seeds make a big harvest . ”
47009007	Each of you must make up your own mind about how much to give . But don't feel sorry that you must give and don't feel you are forced to give . God loves people who love to give .
47009008	God can bless you with everything you need , and you will always have more than enough to do all kinds of good things for others .
47009009	The Scriptures say , “ God freely gives his gifts to the poor , and always does right . ”
47009012	What you are doing is much more than a service that supplies God's people with what they need . It is something that will make many others thank God .
47009013	The way in which you have proved yourselves by this service will bring honor and praise to God . You believed the message about Christ , and you obeyed it by sharing generously with God's people and with everyone else .
47009014	Now they are praying for you and want to see you , because God used you to bless them so very much .
47009015	Thank God for his gift that is too wonderful for words !
47010001	Do you think I am a coward when I am with you and brave when I am far away ? Well , I ask you to listen , because Christ himself was humble and gentle .
47010002	Some people have said we act like the people of this world . So when I arrive , I expect I will have to be firm and forceful in what I say to them . Please don't make me treat you that way .
47010003	We live in this world , but we don't act like its people
47010004	or fight our battles with the weapons of this world . Instead , we use God's power that can destroy fortresses . We destroy arguments
47010005	and every bit of pride that keeps anyone from knowing God . We capture people's thoughts and make them obey Christ .
47010006	And when you completely obey him , we will punish anyone who refuses to obey .
47010007	You judge by appearances . If any of you think you are the only ones who belong to Christ , then think again . We belong to Christ as much as you do .
47010008	Maybe I brag a little too much about the authority that the Lord gave me to help you and not to hurt you . Yet I am not embarrassed to brag .
47010009	And I am not trying to scare you with my letters .
47010010	Some of you are saying , “ Paul's letters are harsh and powerful . But in person , he is a weakling and has nothing worth saying . ”
47010011	Those people had better understand that when I am with you , I will do exactly what I say in my letters .
47010012	We won't dare compare ourselves with those who think so much of themselves . But they are foolish to compare themselves with themselves .
47010013	We won't brag about something we don't have a right to brag about . We will only brag about the work God has sent us to do , and you are part of that work .
47010014	We are not bragging more than we should . After all , we did bring the message about Christ to you .
47010015	We don't brag about what others have done , as if we had done those things ourselves . But I hope as you become stronger in your faith , we will be able to reach many more of the people around you . That has always been our goal .
47010016	Then we will be able to preach the good news in other lands where we cannot take credit for work someone else has already done .
47010017	The Scriptures say , “ If you want to brag , then brag about the Lord . ”
47010018	You may brag about yourself , but the only approval that counts is the Lord's approval .
47011001	Please put up with a little of my foolishness .
47011002	I am as concerned about you as God is . You were like a virgin bride I had chosen only for Christ .
47011003	But now I fear that you will be tricked , just as Eve was tricked by that lying snake . I am afraid that you might stop thinking about Christ in an honest and sincere way .
47011004	We told you about Jesus , and you received the Holy Spirit and accepted our message . But you let some people tell you about another Jesus . Now you are ready to receive another spirit and accept a different message .
47011005	I think I am as good as any of those super apostles .
47011006	I may not speak as well as they do , but I know as much . And this has already been made perfectly clear to you .
47011007	Was it wrong for me to lower myself and honor you by preaching God's message free of charge ?
47011008	I robbed other churches by taking money from them to serve you .
47011009	Even when I was in need , I still didn't bother you . In fact , some of the Lord's followers from Macedonia brought me what I needed . I have not been a burden to you in the past , and I will never be a burden .
47011010	As surely as I speak the truth about Christ , no one in Achaia can stop me from bragging about this .
47011011	And it isn't because I don't love you . God himself knows how much I do love you .
47011012	I plan to go on doing just what I have always done . Then those people won't be able to brag about doing the same things we are doing .
47011013	Anyway , they are no more than false apostles and dishonest workers . They only pretend to be apostles of Christ .
47011014	And it is no wonder . Even Satan tries to make himself look like an angel of light .
47011015	So why does it seem strange for Satan's servants to pretend to do what is right ? Someday they will get exactly what they deserve .
47011016	I don't want any of you to think I am a fool . But if you do , then let me be a fool and brag a little .
47011017	When I do all this bragging , I do it as a fool and not for the Lord .
47011018	Yet if others want to brag about what they have done , so will I .
47011019	And since you are so smart , you will gladly put up with a fool .
47011020	In fact , you let people make slaves of you and cheat you and steal from you . Why , you even let them strut around and slap you in the face .
47011021	I am ashamed to say we are too weak to behave in such a way . If they can brag , so can I , but it is a foolish thing to do .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Jews ? So am I . Are they from the family of Abraham ? Well , so am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? I am a fool to talk this way , but I serve him better than they do . I have worked harder and have been put in jail more times . I have been beaten with whips more and have been in danger of death more often .
47011024	Five times my own people gave me 39 lashes with a whip .
47011025	Three times the Romans beat me with a big stick , and once my enemies stoned me . I have been shipwrecked three times , and I even had to spend a night and a day in the sea .
47011026	During my many travels , I have been in danger from rivers , robbers , my own people , and foreigners . My life has been in danger in cities , in deserts , at sea , and with people who only pretended to be the Lord's followers .
47011027	I have worked and struggled and spent many sleepless nights . I have gone hungry and thirsty and often had nothing to eat . I have been cold from not having enough clothes to keep me warm .
47011028	Besides everything else , each day I am burdened down , worrying about all the churches .
47011029	When others are weak , I am weak too . When others are tricked into sin , I get angry .
47011030	If I have to brag , I will brag about how weak I am .
47011031	God , the Father of our Lord Jesus , knows I am not lying . And God is to be praised forever !
47011032	The governor of Damascus at the time of King Aretas had the city gates guarded , so he could capture me .
47011033	But I escaped by being let down in a basket through a window in the city wall .
47012001	I have to brag . There is nothing to be gained by it , but I must brag about the visions and other things that the Lord has shown me .
47012002	I know about one of Christ's followers who was taken up into the third heaven 14 years ago . I don't know if the man was still in his body when it happened , but God certainly knows .
47012003	As I said , only God really knows if this man was in his body at the time .
47012004	But he was taken up into paradise , where he heard things too wonderful to tell .
47012005	I will brag about that man , but not about myself , except to say how weak I am .
47012006	Yet even if I did brag , I would not be foolish . I would simply be speaking the truth . But I will try not to say too much . That way , none of you will think more highly of me than you should because of what you have seen me do and say .
47012007	Of course , I am now referring to the wonderful things I saw . One of Satan's angels was sent to make me suffer terribly , so that I would not feel too proud .
47012008	Three times I begged the Lord to make this suffering go away .
47012009	But he replied , “ My gift of undeserved grace is all you need . My power is strongest when you are weak . ” So if Christ keeps giving me his power , I will gladly brag about how weak I am .
47012010	Yes , I am glad to be weak or insulted or mistreated or to have troubles and sufferings , if it is for Christ . Because when I am weak , I am strong .
47012011	I have been making a fool of myself . But you forced me to do it , when you should have been speaking up for me . I may be nothing at all , but I am as good as those super apostles .
47012012	When I was with you , I was patient and worked all the powerful miracles and signs and wonders of a true apostle .
47012013	You missed out on only one blessing the other churches received . That is , you didn't have to support me . Forgive me for doing you wrong .
47012014	I am planning to visit you for the third time . But I still won't make a burden of myself . What I really want is you , and not what you have . Children are not supposed to save up for their parents , but parents are supposed to take care of their children .
47012015	So I will gladly give all I have and all I am . Will you love me less for loving you too much ?
47012016	You agree that I wasn't a burden to you . Maybe that's because I was trying to catch you off guard and trick you .
47012017	Were you cheated by any of those I sent to you ?
47012018	I urged Titus to visit you , and I sent another follower with him . But Titus didn't cheat you , and we felt and behaved the same way he did .
47012019	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you ? Actually , we have been speaking to God as followers of Christ . But , my friends , we did it all for your good .
47012020	I am afraid when I come , we won't be pleased with each other . I fear that some of you may be arguing or jealous or angry or selfish or gossiping or insulting each other . I even fear that you may be proud and acting like a mob .
47012021	I am afraid God will make me ashamed when I visit you again . I will feel like crying because many of you have never given up your old sins . You are still doing things that are immoral , indecent , and shameful .
47013001	I am on my way to visit you for the third time . And as the Scriptures say , “ Any charges must be proved true by at least two or three witnesses . ”
47013002	During my second visit I warned you that I would punish you and anyone else who doesn't stop sinning . I am far away from you now , but I give you the same warning .
47013003	This should prove to you that I am speaking for Christ . When he corrects you , he won't be weak . He will be powerful !
47013004	Although he was weak when he was nailed to the cross , he now lives by the power of God . We are weak , just as Christ was . But you will see that we will live by the power of God , just as Christ does .
47013005	Test yourselves and find out if you really are true to your faith . If you pass the test , you will discover that Christ is living in you . But if Christ isn't living in you , you have failed .
47013006	I hope you will discover we have not failed .
47013007	We pray you will stop doing evil things . We don't pray like this to make ourselves look good , but to get you to do right , even if we are failures .
47013008	All we can do is to follow the truth and not fight against it .
47013009	Even though we are weak , we are glad that you are strong , and we pray you will do even better .
47013010	I am writing these things to you before I arrive . This way I won't have to be hard on you when I use the authority the Lord has given me . I was given this authority , so I could help you and not destroy you .
47013011	Goodbye , my friends . Do better and pay attention to what I have said . Try to get along and live peacefully with each other . Now I pray that God , who gives love and peace , will be with you .
47013012	Give each other a warm greeting . All God's people send their greetings .
47013013	
47013014	I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you and be kind to you ! May God bless you with his love , and may the Holy Spirit join all your hearts together .
48001003	I pray that God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
48001004	Christ obeyed God our Father and gave himself as a sacrifice for our sins to rescue us from this evil world .
48001005	God will be given glory forever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I am shocked that you have so quickly turned from God , who chose you with his gift of undeserved grace . You have believed another message ,
48001007	when there is really only one true message . But some people are causing you trouble and want to make you turn away from the good news about Christ .
48001008	I pray that God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from our message to you ! It doesn't matter if that person is one of us or an angel from heaven .
48001009	I have said it before , and I will say it again . I hope God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from what you have already believed .
48001010	I am not trying to please people . I want to please God . Do you think I am trying to please people ? If I were doing that , I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	My friends , I want you to know that no one made up the message I preach .
48001012	It wasn't given or taught to me by some mere human . My message came directly from Jesus Christ when he appeared to me .
48001013	You know how I used to live as a Jew . I was cruel to God's church and even tried to destroy it .
48001014	I was a much better Jew than anyone else my own age , and I obeyed every law our ancestors had given us .
48001015	But even before I was born , God had chosen me by his gift of undeserved grace and had decided
48001016	to show me his Son , so I would announce his message to the Gentiles . I didn't talk this over with anyone .
48001017	I didn't say a word , not even to the men in Jerusalem who were apostles before I was . Instead , I went at once to Arabia , and afterwards I returned to Damascus .
48001018	Three years later I went to visit Peter in Jerusalem and stayed with him for 15 days .
48001019	The only other apostle I saw was James , the Lord's brother .
48001020	And in the presence of God I swear I am telling the truth .
48001021	Later , I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	But no one who belonged to Christ's churches in Judea had ever seen me in person .
48001023	They had only heard that the one who had been cruel to them was now preaching the message that he had once tried to destroy .
48001024	And because of me , they praised God .
48002001	Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem with Barnabas . I also took along Titus .
48002002	But I went there because God had told me to go , and I explained the good news I had been preaching to the Gentiles . Then I met privately with the ones who seemed to be the most important leaders . I wanted to make sure my work in the past and my future work would not be for nothing .
48002003	Titus went to Jerusalem with me . He was a Greek , but still he wasn't forced to be circumcised .
48002004	We went there because of those who pretended to be followers and had sneaked in among us as spies . They had come to take away the freedom Christ Jesus had given us , and they were trying to make us their slaves .
48002005	But we wanted you to have the true message . This is why we didn't give in to them , not even for a second .
48002006	Some of them were supposed to be important leaders , but I didn't care who they were . God doesn't have any favorites ! None of these so-called special leaders added anything to my message .
48002007	They realized God had sent me with the good news for Gentiles , and he had sent Peter with the same message for Jews .
48002008	God , who had sent Peter on a mission to the Jews , was now using me to preach to the Gentiles .
48002009	James , Peter , and John realized that God had given me the message about his gift of undeserved grace . And these men are supposed to be the backbone of the church . They even gave Barnabas and me a friendly handshake . This was to show that we would work with Gentiles and that they would work with Jews .
48002010	They only asked us to remember the poor , and this was something I had always been eager to do .
48002011	When Peter came to Antioch , I told him face to face that he was wrong .
48002012	He used to eat with Gentile followers of the Lord , until James sent some Jewish followers . Peter was afraid of the Jews and soon stopped eating with Gentiles .
48002013	He and the others hid their true feelings so well that even Barnabas was fooled .
48002014	But when I saw they were not really obeying the truth that is in the good news , I corrected Peter in front of everyone and said :
48003001	You stupid Galatians ! I told you exactly how Jesus Christ was nailed to a cross . Has someone now put an evil spell on you ?
48003002	I want to know only one thing . How were you given God's Spirit ? Was it by obeying the Law of Moses or by hearing about Christ and having faith in him ?
48003003	How can you be so stupid ? Do you think that by yourself you can complete what God's Spirit started in you ?
48003004	Have you gone through all of this for nothing ? Is it all really for nothing ?
48003005	God gives you his Spirit and works miracles in you . But does he do this because you obey the Law of Moses or because you have heard about Christ and have faith in him ?
48003006	The Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith .
48003007	And so , you should understand that everyone who has faith is a child of Abraham .
48003008	Long ago the Scriptures said God would accept the Gentiles because of their faith . This is why God told Abraham the good news that all nations would be blessed because of him .
48003009	This means everyone who has faith will share in the blessings given to Abraham because of his faith .
48003010	Anyone who tries to please God by obeying the Law is under a curse . The Scriptures say , “ Everyone who doesn't obey everything in the Law is under a curse . ”
48003011	No one can please God by obeying the Law . The Scriptures also say , “ The people God accepts because of their faith will live . ”
48003012	The Law isn't based on faith . It promises life only to people who obey its commands .
48003013	But Christ rescued us from the Law's curse , when he became a curse in our place . This is because the Scriptures say that anyone who is nailed to a tree is under a curse .
48003014	And because of what Jesus Christ has done , the blessing promised to Abraham was taken to the Gentiles . This happened so that by faith we would be given the promised Holy Spirit .
48003015	My friends , I will use an everyday example to explain what I mean . Once someone agrees to something , no one else can change or cancel the agreement .
48003016	That is how it is with the promises God made to Abraham and his descendant . The promises were not made to many descendants , but only to one , and that one is Christ .
48003017	What I am saying is that the Law cannot change or cancel God's promise made 430 years before the Law was given .
48003018	If we have to obey the Law in order to receive God's blessings , those blessings don't really come to us because of God's promise . But God was kind to Abraham and made him a promise .
48003019	What is the use of the Law ? It was given later to show that we sin . But it was only supposed to last until the coming of that descendant who was given the promise . In fact , angels gave the Law to Moses , and he gave it to the people .
48003020	There is only one God , and the Law did not come directly from him .
48003021	Does the Law disagree with God's promises ? No , it doesn't ! If any law could give life to us , we could become acceptable to God by obeying that law .
48003022	But the Scriptures say that sin controls everyone , so that God's promises will be for anyone who has faith in Jesus Christ .
48003023	The Law controlled us and kept us under its power until the time came when we would have faith .
48003024	In fact , the Law was to be our teacher until Christ came . Then we could have faith and be acceptable to God .
48003025	But once a person has learned to have faith , there is no more need to have the Law as a teacher .
48003026	All of you are God's children because of your faith in Christ Jesus .
48003027	And when you were baptized , it was as though you had put on Christ in the same way you put on new clothes .
48003028	Faith in Christ Jesus is what makes each of you equal with each other , whether you are a Jew or a Greek , a slave or a free person , a man or a woman .
48003029	So if you belong to Christ , you are now part of Abraham's family , and you will be given what God has promised .
48004004	But when the time was right , God sent his Son , and a woman gave birth to him . His Son obeyed the Law ,
48004005	so he could set us free from the Law , and we could become God's children .
48004006	Now that we are his children , God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts . And his Spirit tells us that God is our Father .
48004007	You are no longer slaves . You are God's children , and you will be given what he has promised .
48004008	Before you knew God , you were slaves of gods that are not real .
48004009	But now you know God , or better still , God knows you . How can you turn back and become the slaves of those weak and pitiful powers ?
48004010	You even celebrate certain days , months , seasons , and years .
48004011	I am afraid I have wasted my time working with you .
48004012	My friends , I beg you to be like me , just as I once tried to be like you . Did you mistreat me
48004013	when I first preached to you ? No you didn't , even though you knew I had come there because I was sick .
48004014	My illness must have caused you some trouble , but you didn't hate me or turn me away because of it . You welcomed me as though I were one of God's angels or even Christ Jesus himself .
48004015	Where is that good feeling now ? I am sure if it had been possible , you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me .
48004016	Am I now your enemy , just because I told you the truth ?
48004017	Those people may be paying you a lot of attention , but it isn't for your good . They only want to keep you away from me , so you will pay them a lot of attention .
48004018	It is always good to give your attention to something worthwhile , even when I am not with you .
48004019	My children , I am in terrible pain until Christ may be seen living in you .
48004020	I wish I were with you now . Then I would not have to talk this way . You really have me puzzled .
48004021	Some of you would like to be under the rule of the Law of Moses . But do you know what the Law says ?
48004022	In the Scriptures we learn that Abraham had two sons . The mother of one of them was a slave , while the mother of the other one had always been free .
48004023	The son of the slave woman was born in the usual way . But the son of the free woman was born because of God's promise .
48004024	All of this has another meaning as well . Each of the two women stands for one of the agreements God made with his people . Hagar , the slave woman , stands for the agreement that was made at Mount Sinai . Everyone born into her family is a slave .
48004025	Hagar also stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and for the present city of Jerusalem . She and her children are slaves .
48004026	But our mother is the city of Jerusalem in heaven above , and she isn't a slave .
48004027	The Scriptures say about her , “ You have never had children , but now you can be glad . You have never given birth , but now you can shout . Once you had no children , but now you will have more children than a woman who has been married for a long time . ”
48004028	My friends , you were born because of this promise , just as Isaac was .
48004029	But the child who was born in the natural way made trouble for the child who was born because of the Spirit . The same thing is happening today .
48004030	The Scriptures say , “ Get rid of the slave woman and her son ! He won't be given anything . The son of the free woman will receive everything . ”
48004031	My friends , we are children of the free woman and not of the slave .
48005001	Christ has set us free ! This means we are really free . Now hold on to your freedom and don't ever become slaves of the Law again .
48005002	I , Paul , promise you that Christ won't do you any good if you get circumcised .
48005003	If you do , you must obey the whole Law .
48005004	And if you try to please God by obeying the Law , you have cut yourself off from Christ and his gift of undeserved grace .
48005005	But the Spirit makes us sure God will accept us because of our faith in Christ .
48005006	If you are a follower of Christ Jesus , it makes no difference whether you are circumcised or not . All that matters is your faith that makes you love others .
48005007	You were doing so well until someone made you turn from the truth .
48005008	And that person was certainly not sent by the one who chose you .
48005009	A little yeast can change a whole batch of dough ,
48005010	but you belong to the Lord . This makes me certain you will do what I say , instead of what someone else tells you to do . Whoever is causing trouble for you will be punished .
48005011	My friends , if I still preach that people need to be circumcised , why am I in so much trouble ? The message about the cross would no longer be a problem , if I told people to be circumcised .
48005012	I wish everyone who is upsetting you would not only get circumcised , but would cut off much more !
48005013	My friends , you were chosen to be free . So don't use your freedom as an excuse to do anything you want . Use it as an opportunity to serve each other with love .
48005014	All the Law says can be summed up in the command to love others as much as you love yourself .
48005015	But if you keep attacking each other like wild animals , you had better watch out or you will destroy yourselves .
48005016	If you are guided by the Spirit , you won't obey your selfish desires .
48005017	The Spirit and your desires are enemies of each other . They are always fighting each other and keeping you from doing what you feel you should .
48005018	But if you obey the Spirit , the Law of Moses has no control over you .
48005019	People's desires make them give in to immoral ways , filthy thoughts , and shameful deeds .
48005020	They worship idols , practice witchcraft , hate others , and are hard to get along with . People become jealous , angry , and selfish . They not only argue and cause trouble , but they are
48005021	envious . They get drunk , carry on at wild parties , and do other evil things as well . I told you before , and I am telling you again : No one who does these things will share in the blessings of God's kingdom .
48005022	God's Spirit makes us loving , happy , peaceful , patient , kind , good , faithful ,
48005023	gentle , and self-controlled . There is no law against behaving in any of these ways .
48005024	And because we belong to Christ Jesus , we have killed our selfish feelings and desires .
48005025	God's Spirit has given us life , and so we should follow the Spirit .
48005026	But don't be conceited or make others jealous by claiming to be better than they are .
48006001	My friends , you are spiritual . So if someone is trapped in sin , you should gently lead that person back to the right path . But watch out , and don't be tempted yourself .
48006002	You obey the law of Christ when you offer each other a helping hand .
48006003	If you think you are better than others , when you really aren't , you are wrong .
48006004	Do your own work well , and then you will have something to be proud of . But don't compare yourself with others .
48006005	We each must carry our own load .
48006006	Share every good thing you have with anyone who teaches you what God has said .
48006007	You cannot fool God , so don't make a fool of yourself ! You will harvest what you plant .
48006008	If you follow your selfish desires , you will harvest destruction , but if you follow the Spirit , you will harvest eternal life .
48006009	Don't get tired of helping others . You will be rewarded when the time is right , if you don't give up .
48006010	We should help people whenever we can , especially if they are followers of the Lord .
48006011	You can see what big letters I make when I write with my own hand .
48006012	Those people who are telling you to get circumcised are only trying to show how important they are . And they don't want to get into trouble for preaching about the cross of Christ .
48006013	They are circumcised , but they don't obey the Law of Moses . All they want is to brag about having you circumcised .
48006014	But I will never brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . Because of his cross , the world is dead as far as I am concerned , and I am dead as far as the world is concerned .
48006015	It doesn't matter if you are circumcised or not . All that matters is that you are a new person .
48006016	If you follow this rule , you will belong to God's true people . God will treat you with undeserved kindness and will bless you with peace .
48006017	On my own body are scars that prove I belong to Christ Jesus . So I don't want anyone to bother me anymore .
48006018	My friends , I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you ! Amen .
49001001	From Paul , chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus . To God's people who live in Ephesus and are faithful followers of Christ Jesus .
49001002	I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
49001003	Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for the spiritual blessings that Christ has brought us from heaven !
49001004	Before the world was created , God had Christ choose us to live with him and to be his holy and innocent and loving people .
49001005	God was kind and decided that Christ would choose us to be God's own adopted children .
49001006	God treated us with undeserved grace because of the Son he dearly loves , and so we should praise God .
49001009	and by what Christ has done , God has shown us his own mysterious ways .
49001010	Then when the time is right , God will do all he has planned , and Christ will bring together everything in heaven and on earth .
49001011	God always does what he plans , and this is why he appointed Christ to choose us .
49001012	He did this so we Jews would bring honor to him and be the first ones to have hope because of him .
49001013	Christ also brought you the truth , which is the good news about how you can be saved . You put your faith in Christ and were given the promised Holy Spirit to show you belong to God .
49001014	The Spirit also makes us sure we will be given what God has stored up for his people . Then we will be set free , and God will be honored and praised .
49001015	I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people .
49001016	So I never stop being grateful for you , as I mention you in my prayers .
49001017	I ask the glorious Father and God of our Lord Jesus Christ to give you his Spirit . The Spirit will make you wise and let you understand what it means to know God .
49001018	My prayer is that light will flood your hearts and you will understand the hope given to you when God chose you . Then you will discover the glorious blessings that will be yours together with all God's people .
49001019	I want you to know about the great and mighty power that God has for us followers . It is the same wonderful power he used
49001020	when he raised Christ from death and let him sit at his right side in heaven .
49001021	There Christ rules over all forces , authorities , powers , and rulers . He rules over all beings in this world and will rule in the future world as well .
49001022	God has put all things under the power of Christ , and for the good of the church he has made him the head of everything .
49001023	The church is the body of Christ and is filled with Christ who completely fills everything .
49002001	In the past you were dead because you sinned and fought against God .
49002002	You followed the ways of this world and obeyed the devil . He rules the world , and his spirit has power over everyone who doesn't obey God .
49002003	Once we were also ruled by the selfish desires of our bodies and minds . We had made God angry , and we were going to be punished like everyone else .
49002006	God raised us from death to life with Christ Jesus , and he has given us a place beside Christ in heaven .
49002007	God did this so in the future world he could show how truly good and kind he is to us because of what Christ Jesus has done .
49002008	You were saved by faith in God , who treats us much better than we deserve . This is God's gift to you , and not anything you have done on your own .
49002009	It isn't something you have earned , so there is nothing you can brag about .
49002010	God planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live . This is why he sent Christ to make us what we are .
49002011	Don't forget that you are Gentiles . In fact , you used to be called “ uncircumcised ” by those who take pride in being circumcised .
49002012	At that time you did not know about Christ . You were foreigners to the people of Israel , and you had no part in the promises God had made to them . You were living in this world without hope and without God ,
49002013	and you were far from God . But Christ offered his life's blood as a sacrifice and brought you near God .
49002014	Christ has made peace between Jews and Gentiles , and he has united us by breaking down the wall of hatred that separated us . Christ gave his own body
49002015	to destroy the Law of Moses with all its rules and commands . He even brought Jews and Gentiles together as though we were only one person , when he united us in peace .
49002016	On the cross Christ did away with our hatred for each other . He also made peace between us and God by uniting Jews and Gentiles in one body .
49002017	Christ came and preached peace to you Gentiles , who were far from God , and peace to us Jews , who were near God .
49002018	And because of Christ , all of us can come to the Father by the same Spirit .
49002019	You Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners . You are citizens with everyone else who belongs to the family of God .
49002020	You are like a building with the apostles and prophets as the foundation and with Christ as the most important stone .
49002021	Christ is the one who holds the building together and makes it grow into a holy temple for the Lord .
49002022	And you are part of that building Christ has built as a place for God's own Spirit to live .
49003001	Christ Jesus made me his prisoner , so I could help you Gentiles .
49003002	You have surely heard about God's gift of undeserved grace in choosing me to help you .
49003003	In fact , this letter tells you a little about how God has shown me his mysterious ways .
49003004	As you read the letter , you will also find out how well I really do understand the mystery about Christ .
49003005	No one knew about this mystery until God's Spirit told it to his holy apostles and prophets .
49003006	And the mystery is this : Because of Christ Jesus , the good news has given the Gentiles a share in the promises God gave to the Jews . God has also let the Gentiles be part of the same body .
49003007	God treated me with kindness . His power worked in me , and it became my job to spread the good news .
49003008	I am the least important of all God's people . But God was kind and chose me to tell the Gentiles that because of Christ there are blessings that cannot be measured .
49003009	God , who created everything , wanted me to help everyone understand the mysterious plan that had always been hidden in his mind .
49003010	Then God would use the church to show the powers and authorities in the spiritual world that he has many different kinds of wisdom .
49003011	God did this according to his eternal plan . And he was able to do what he had planned because of all Christ Jesus our Lord had done .
49003012	Christ now gives us courage and confidence , so we can come to God by faith .
49003013	This is why you should not be discouraged when I suffer for you . After all , it will bring honor to you .
49003014	I kneel in prayer to the Father .
49003015	All beings in heaven and on earth receive their life from him .
49003016	God is wonderful and glorious . I pray that his Spirit will make you become strong followers
49003017	and that Christ will live in your hearts because of your faith . Stand firm and be deeply rooted in his love .
49003018	I pray that you and all God's people will understand what is called wide or long or high or deep .
49003019	I want you to know all about Christ's love , although it is too wonderful to be measured . Then your lives will be filled with all that God is .
49004001	As a prisoner of the Lord , I beg you to live in a way that is worthy of the people God has chosen to be his own .
49004002	Always be humble and gentle . Patiently put up with each other and love each other .
49004003	Try your best to let God's Spirit keep your hearts united . Do this by living at peace .
49004004	All of you are part of the same body . There is only one Spirit of God , just as you were given one hope when you were chosen to be God's people .
49004005	We have only one Lord , one faith , and one baptism .
49004006	There is one God who is the Father of all people . Not only is God above all others , but he works by using all of us , and he lives in all of us .
49004007	Christ has generously divided out his gifts to us .
49004008	As the Scriptures say , “ When he went up to the highest place , he led away many prisoners and gave gifts to people . ”
49004009	When it says , “ he went up , ” it means that Christ had been deep in the earth .
49004010	This also means that the one who went deep into the earth is the same one who went into the highest heaven , so he would fill the whole universe .
49004011	Christ chose some of us to be apostles , prophets , missionaries , pastors , and teachers ,
49004012	so his people would learn to serve and his body would grow strong .
49004013	This will continue until we are united by our faith and by our understanding of the Son of God . Then we will be mature , just as Christ is , and we will be completely like him .
49004014	We must stop acting like children . We must not let deceitful people trick us by their false teachings , which are like winds that toss us around from place to place .
49004015	Love should always make us tell the truth . Then we will grow in every way and be more like Christ , the head
49004016	of the body . Christ holds it together and makes all of its parts work perfectly , as it grows and becomes strong because of love .
49004017	As a follower of the Lord , I order you to stop living like stupid , godless people .
49004018	Their minds are in the dark , and they are stubborn and ignorant and have missed out on the life that comes from God . They no longer have any feelings about what is right ,
49004019	and they are so greedy they do all kinds of indecent things .
49004022	You were told that your foolish desires will destroy you and that you must give up your old way of life with all its bad habits .
49004023	Let the Spirit change your way of thinking
49004024	and make you into a new person . You were created to be like God , and so you must please him and be truly holy .
49004025	We are part of the same body . Stop lying and start telling each other the truth .
49004026	Don't get so angry that you sin . Don't go to bed angry
49004027	and don't give the devil a chance .
49004028	If you are a thief , quit stealing . Be honest and work hard , so you will have something to give to people in need .
49004029	Stop all your dirty talk . Say the right thing at the right time and help others by what you say .
49004030	Don't make God's Spirit sad . The Spirit makes you sure that someday you will be free from your sins .
49004031	Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others . Don't yell at one another or curse each other or ever be rude .
49004032	Instead , be kind and merciful , and forgive others , just as God forgave you because of Christ .
49005001	Do as God does . After all , you are his dear children .
49005002	Let love be your guide . Christ loved us and offered his life for us as a sacrifice that pleases God .
49005003	You are God's people , so don't let it be said that any of you are immoral or indecent or greedy .
49005004	Don't use dirty or foolish or filthy words . Instead , say how thankful you are .
49005005	Being greedy , indecent , or immoral is just another way of worshiping idols . You can be sure people who behave in this way will never be part of the kingdom that belongs to Christ and to God .
49005006	Don't let anyone trick you with foolish talk . God punishes everyone who disobeys him and says foolish things .
49005007	So don't have anything to do with anyone like that .
49005008	You used to be like people living in the dark , but now you are people of the light because you belong to the Lord . So act like people of the light
49005009	and make your light shine . Be good and honest and truthful ,
49005010	as you try to please the Lord .
49005011	Don't take part in doing those worthless things that are done in the dark . Instead , show how wrong they are .
49005012	It is disgusting even to talk about what is done in the dark .
49005013	But the light will show what these things are really like .
49005014	Light shows up everything , just as the Scriptures say , “ Wake up from your sleep and rise from death . Then Christ will shine on you . ”
49005015	Act like people with good sense and not like fools .
49005016	These are evil times , so make every minute count .
49005017	Don't be stupid . Instead , find out what the Lord wants you to do .
49005018	Don't destroy yourself by getting drunk , but let the Spirit fill your life .
49005019	When you meet together , sing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , as you praise the Lord with all your heart .
49005020	Always use the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to thank God the Father for everything .
49005021	Honor Christ and put others first .
49005022	A wife should put her husband first , as she does the Lord .
49005023	A husband is the head of his wife , as Christ is the head and the Savior of the church , which is his own body .
49005024	Wives should always put their husbands first , as the church puts Christ first .
49005025	A husband should love his wife as much as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it .
49005026	He made the church holy by the power of his word , and he made it pure by washing it with water .
49005027	Christ did this , so he would have a glorious and holy church , without faults or spots or wrinkles or any other flaws .
49005028	In the same way , a husband should love his wife as much as he loves himself . A husband who loves his wife shows he loves himself .
49005029	None of us hate our own bodies . We provide for them and take good care of them , just as Christ does for the church ,
49005030	because we are each part of his body .
49005031	As the Scriptures say , “ A man leaves his father and mother to get married , and he becomes like one person with his wife . ”
49005032	This is a great mystery , but I understand it to mean Christ and his church .
49005033	So each husband should love his wife as much as he loves himself , and each wife should respect her husband .
49006001	Children , you belong to the Lord , and you do the right thing when you obey your parents . The first commandment with a promise says ,
49006002	“ Obey your father and your mother ,
49006003	and you will have a long and happy life . ”
49006004	Parents , don't be hard on your children . Raise them properly . Teach them and instruct them about the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , you must obey your earthly masters . Show them great respect and be as loyal to them as you are to Christ .
49006006	Try to please them at all times , and not just when you think they are watching . You are slaves of Christ , so with your whole heart you must do what God wants you to do .
49006007	Gladly serve your masters , as though they were the Lord himself , and not simply people .
49006008	You know that you will be rewarded for any good things you do , whether you are slaves or free .
49006009	Slave owners , you must treat your slaves with this same respect . Don't threaten them . They have the same Master in heaven that you do , and he doesn't have favorites .
49006010	Finally , let the mighty strength of the Lord make you strong .
49006011	Put on all the armor that God gives , so you can defend yourself against the devil's tricks .
49006012	We are not fighting against humans . We are fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world .
49006013	So put on all the armor that God gives . Then when that evil day comes , you will be able to defend yourself . And when the battle is over , you will still be standing firm .
49006014	Be ready ! Let the truth be like a belt around your waist , and let God's justice protect you like armor .
49006015	Your desire to tell the good news about peace should be like shoes on your feet .
49006016	Let your faith be like a shield , and you will be able to stop all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
49006017	Let God's saving power be like a helmet , and for a sword use God's message that comes from the Spirit .
49006018	Never stop praying , especially for others . Always pray by the power of the Spirit . Stay alert and keep praying for God's people .
49006019	Pray that I will be given the message to speak and that I may fearlessly explain the mystery about the good news .
49006020	I was sent to do this work , and this is the reason I am in jail . So pray that I will be brave and will speak as I should .
49006023	I pray that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will give peace , love , and faith to every follower !
49006024	May God be kind to everyone who keeps on loving our Lord Jesus Christ .
50001001	From Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus . To all God's people who belong to Christ Jesus at Philippi and to all your bishops and deacons .
50001002	I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
50001003	Every time I think of you , I thank my God .
50001004	And whenever I mention you in my prayers , it makes me happy .
50001005	This is because you have taken part with me in spreading the good news from the first day you heard about it .
50001006	God is the one who began this good work in you , and I am certain that he won't stop before it is complete on the day that Christ Jesus returns .
50001007	You have a special place in my heart . So it is only natural for me to feel the way I do . All of you have helped in the work God has given me , as I defend the good news and tell about it here in jail .
50001008	God himself knows how much I want to see you . He knows I care for you in the same way Christ Jesus does .
50001009	I pray that your love will keep on growing and you will fully know and understand
50001010	how to make the right choices . Then you will still be pure and innocent when Christ returns . And until that day ,
50001011	Jesus Christ will keep you busy doing good deeds that bring glory and praise to God .
50001012	My dear friends , I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the good news .
50001013	The Roman guards and all the others know I am here in jail because I serve Christ .
50001014	Now most of the Lord's followers have become brave and are fearlessly telling the message .
50001015	Some are preaching about Christ because they are jealous and envious of us . Others are preaching because they want to help .
50001016	They love Christ and know I am here to defend the good news about him .
50001017	But the ones who are jealous of us are not sincere . They just want to cause trouble for me while I am in jail .
50001018	But that doesn't matter . All that matters is that people are telling about Christ , whether they are sincere or not . This is what makes me glad . I will keep on being glad ,
50001019	because I know that your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Christ Jesus will keep me safe .
50001020	I honestly expect and hope I will never do anything to be ashamed of . Whether I live or die , I always want to be as brave as I am now and bring honor to Christ .
50001021	If I live , it will be for Christ , and if I die , I will gain even more .
50001022	I don't know what to choose . I could keep on living and doing something useful .
50001023	It is a hard choice to make . I want to die and be with Christ , because this would be much better .
50001026	Then , when I visit you again , you will have good reason to take great pride in Christ Jesus because of me .
50001027	Above all else , you must live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ . Then , whether I visit you or not , I will hear that all of you think alike . I will know that you are working together and are struggling side by side to get others to believe the good news .
50001028	Be brave when you face your enemies . Your courage will show them that they are going to be destroyed , and it will show you that you will be saved . God will make all of this happen ,
50001029	and he has blessed you . Not only do you have faith in Christ , but you suffer for him .
50001030	You saw me suffer , and you still hear about my troubles . Now you must suffer in the same way .
50002001	Christ encourages you , and his love comforts you . God's Spirit unites you , and you are concerned for others .
50002002	Now make me completely happy ! Live in harmony by showing love for each other . Be united in what you think , as if you were only one person .
50002003	Don't be jealous or proud , but be humble and consider others more important than yourselves .
50002004	Care about them as much as you care about yourselves
50002005	and think the same way that Christ Jesus thought :
50002006	Christ was truly God . But he did not try to remain equal with God .
50002007	Instead he gave up everything and became a slave , when he became like one of us .
50002008	Christ was humble . He obeyed God and even died on a cross .
50002009	Then God gave Christ the highest place and honored his name above all others .
50002010	So at the name of Jesus everyone will bow down , those in heaven , on earth , and under the earth .
50002011	And to the glory of God the Father everyone will openly agree , “ Jesus Christ is Lord ! ”
50002012	My dear friends , you always obeyed when I was with you . Now that I am away , you should obey even more . So work with fear and trembling to discover what it really means to be saved .
50002013	God is working in you to make you willing and able to obey him .
50002014	Do everything without grumbling or arguing .
50002015	Then you will be the pure and innocent children of God . You live among people who are crooked and evil , but you must not do anything they can say is wrong . Try to shine as lights among the people of this world ,
50002016	as you hold firmly to the message that gives life . Then on the day when Christ returns , I can take pride in you . I can also know that my work and efforts were not useless .
50002017	Your faith in the Lord and your service are like a sacrifice offered to him . And my own blood may have to be poured out with the sacrifice . If this happens , I will be glad and rejoice with you .
50002018	In the same way , you should be glad and rejoice with me .
50002019	I want to be encouraged by news about you . So I hope the Lord Jesus will soon let me send Timothy to you .
50002020	I don't have anyone else who cares about you as much as he does .
50002021	The others think only about what interests them and not about what concerns Christ Jesus .
50002022	But you know what kind of person Timothy is . He has worked with me like a son in spreading the good news .
50002023	I hope to send him to you , as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me .
50002024	And I feel sure the Lord will also let me come soon .
50002025	I think I ought to send my dear friend Epaphroditus back to you . He is a follower and a worker and a soldier of the Lord , just as I am . You sent him to look after me ,
50002026	but now he is eager to see you . He is worried , because you heard he was sick .
50002027	In fact , he was very sick and almost died . But God was kind to him , and also to me , and he kept me from being burdened down with sorrow .
50002028	Now I am more eager than ever to send Epaphroditus back again . You will be glad to see him , and I won't have to worry any longer .
50002029	Be sure to give him a cheerful welcome , just as people who serve the Lord deserve .
50002030	He almost died working for Christ , and he risked his own life to do for me what you could not .
50003001	Finally , my dear friends , be glad that you belong to the Lord . It doesn't bother me to write the same things to you that I have written before . In fact , it is for your own good .
50003002	Watch out for those people who behave like dogs ! They are evil and want to do more than just circumcise you .
50003003	But we are the ones who are truly circumcised , because we worship by the power of God's Spirit and take pride in Christ Jesus . We don't brag about what we have done ,
50003004	although I could . Others may brag about themselves , but I have more reason to brag than anyone else .
50003005	I was circumcised when I was eight days old , and I am from the nation of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a true Hebrew . As a Pharisee , I strictly obeyed the Law of Moses .
50003006	And I was so eager I even made trouble for the church . I did everything the Law demands in order to please God .
50003007	But Christ has shown me that what I once thought was valuable is worthless .
50003008	Nothing is as wonderful as knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . I have given up everything else and count it all as garbage . All I want is Christ
50003009	and to know that I belong to him . I could not make myself acceptable to God by obeying the Law of Moses . God accepted me simply because of my faith in Christ .
50003010	All I want is to know Christ and the power that raised him to life . I want to suffer and die as he did ,
50003011	so that somehow I also may be raised to life .
50003012	I have not yet reached my goal , and I am not perfect . But Christ has taken hold of me . So I keep on running and struggling to take hold of the prize .
50003013	My friends , I don't feel I have already arrived . But I forget what is behind , and I struggle for what is ahead .
50003014	I run toward the goal , so I can win the prize of being called to heaven . This is the prize God offers because of what Christ Jesus has done .
50003015	All of us who are mature should think in this same way . And if any of you think differently , God will make it clear to you .
50003016	But we must keep going in the direction that we are now headed .
50003017	My friends , I want you to follow my example and learn from others who closely follow the example we set for you .
50003018	I often warned you that many people are living as enemies of the cross of Christ . And now with tears in my eyes , I warn you again
50003019	that they are headed for hell ! They worship their stomachs and brag about the disgusting things they do . All they can think about are the things of this world .
50003020	But we are citizens of heaven and are eagerly waiting for our Savior to come from there . Our Lord Jesus Christ
50003021	has power over everything , and he will make these poor bodies of ours like his own glorious body .
50004001	Dear friends , I love you and long to see you . Please keep on being faithful to the Lord . You are my pride and joy .
50004002	Euodia and Syntyche , you belong to the Lord , so I beg you to stop arguing with each other .
50004003	And , my true partner , I ask you to help them . These women have worked together with me and with Clement and with the others in spreading the good news . Their names are now written in the book of life .
50004004	Always be glad because of the Lord ! I will say it again : Be glad .
50004005	Always be gentle with others . The Lord will soon be here .
50004006	Don't worry about anything , but pray about everything . With thankful hearts offer up your prayers and requests to God .
50004007	Then , because you belong to Christ Jesus , God will bless you with peace that no one can completely understand . And this peace will control the way you think and feel .
50004008	Finally , my friends , keep your minds on whatever is true , pure , right , holy , friendly , and proper . Don't ever stop thinking about what is truly worthwhile and worthy of praise .
50004009	You know the teachings I gave you , and you know what you heard me say and saw me do . So follow my example . And God , who gives peace , will be with you .
50004010	The Lord has made me very grateful that at last you have thought about me once again . Actually , you were thinking about me all along , but you didn't have any chance to show it .
50004011	I am not complaining about having too little . I have learned to be satisfied with whatever I have .
50004012	I know what it is to be poor or to have plenty , and I have lived under all kinds of conditions . I know what it means to be full or to be hungry , to have too much or too little .
50004013	Christ gives me the strength to face anything .
50004014	It was good of you to help me when I was having such a hard time .
50004015	My friends at Philippi , you remember what it was like when I started preaching the good news in Macedonia . After I left there , you were the only church that became my partner by giving blessings and by receiving them in return .
50004016	Even when I was in Thessalonica , you helped me more than once .
50004017	I am not trying to get something from you , but I want you to receive the blessings that come from giving .
50004018	I have been paid back everything , and with interest . I am completely satisfied with the gifts you sent with Epaphroditus . They are like a sweet-smelling offering or like the right kind of sacrifice that pleases God .
50004019	I pray that God will take care of all your needs with the wonderful blessings that come from Christ Jesus !
50004020	May God our Father be praised forever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Give my greetings to all who are God's people because of Christ Jesus . The Lord's followers here with me send you their greetings .
50004022	All of God's people send their greetings , especially those in the service of the Emperor .
50004023	I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless your life !
51001001	From Paul , chosen by God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , and from Timothy , who is also a follower .
51001002	To God's people who live in Colossae and are faithful followers of Christ . I pray that God our Father will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
51001003	Each time we pray for you , we thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
51001004	We have heard of your faith in Christ and of your love for all God's people ,
51001005	because what you hope for is kept safe for you in heaven . You first heard about this hope when you believed the true message , which is the good news .
51001006	The good news is spreading all over the world with great success . It has spread in this same way among you , ever since the first day you learned the truth about God's wonderful kindness
51001007	from our good friend Epaphras . He works together with us for Christ and is a faithful worker for you .
51001008	He is also the one who told us about the love that God's Spirit has given you .
51001009	We have not stopped praying for you since the first day we heard about you . In fact , we always pray that God will show you everything he wants you to do and that you may have all the wisdom and understanding his Spirit gives .
51001010	Then you will live a life that honors the Lord , and you will always please him by doing good deeds . You will come to know God even better .
51001011	His glorious power will make you patient and strong enough to endure anything , and you will be truly happy .
51001012	I pray that you will be grateful to God for letting you have part in what he has promised his people in the kingdom of light .
51001013	God rescued us from the dark power of Satan and brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son ,
51001014	who forgives our sins and sets us free .
51001015	Christ is exactly like God , who cannot be seen . He is the first-born Son , superior to all creation .
51001016	Everything was created by him , everything in heaven and on earth , everything seen and unseen , including all forces and powers , and all rulers and authorities . All things were created by God's Son , and everything was made for him .
51001017	God's Son was before all else , and by him everything is held together .
51001018	He is the head of his body , which is the church . He is the very beginning , the first to be raised from death , so that he would be above all others .
51001019	God himself was pleased to live fully in his Son .
51001020	And God was pleased for him to make peace by sacrificing his blood on the cross , so that all beings in heaven and on earth would be brought back to God .
51001021	You used to be far from God . Your thoughts made you his enemies , and you did evil things .
51001022	But his Son became a human and died . So God made peace with you , and now he lets you stand in his presence as people who are holy and faultless and innocent .
51001023	But you must stay deeply rooted and firm in your faith . You must not give up the hope you received when you heard the good news . It was preached to everyone on earth , and I myself have become a servant of this message .
51001024	I am glad I can suffer for you . I am pleased also that in my own body I can continue the suffering of Christ for his body , the church .
51001025	God's plan was to make me a servant of his church and to send me to preach his complete message to you .
51001026	For ages and ages this message was kept secret from everyone , but now it has been explained to God's people .
51001027	God did this because he wanted you Gentiles to understand his wonderful and glorious mystery . And the mystery is that Christ lives in you , and he is your hope of sharing in God's glory .
51001028	We announce the message about Christ , and we use all our wisdom to warn and teach everyone , so all of Christ's followers will grow and become mature .
51001029	This is why I work so hard and use the mighty power he gives me .
51002001	I want you to know what a struggle I am going through for you , for God's people at Laodicea , and for all of those followers who have never met me .
51002002	I do it to encourage them . Then as their hearts are joined together in love , they will be wonderfully blessed with complete understanding . And they will truly know Christ . Not only is he the key to God's mystery ,
51002003	but all wisdom and knowledge are hidden away in him .
51002004	I tell you these things to keep you from being fooled by fancy talk .
51002005	Even though I am not with you , I keep thinking about you . I am glad to know that you are living as you should and your faith in Christ is strong .
51002006	You have accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord . Now keep on following him .
51002007	Plant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life . Be strong in your faith , just as you were taught . And be grateful .
51002008	Don't let anyone fool you by using senseless arguments . These arguments may sound wise , but they are only human teachings . They come from the powers of this world and not from Christ .
51002009	God lives fully in Christ .
51002010	And you are fully grown because you belong to Christ , who is over every power and authority .
51002011	Christ has also taken away your selfish desires , just as circumcision removes flesh from the body .
51002012	And when you were baptized , it was the same as being buried with Christ . Then you were raised to life because you had faith in the power of God , who raised Christ from death .
51002013	You were dead , because you were sinful and were not God's people . But God let Christ make you alive , when he forgave all our sins .
51002014	God wiped out the charges that were against us for disobeying the Law of Moses . He took them away and nailed them to the cross .
51002015	There Christ defeated all powers and forces . He let the whole world see them being led away as prisoners when he celebrated his victory .
51002016	Don't let anyone tell you what you must eat or drink . Don't let them say you must celebrate the New Moon festival , the Sabbath , or any other festival .
51002017	These things are only a shadow of what was to come . But Christ is real !
51002018	Don't be cheated by people who make a show of acting humble and who worship angels . They brag about seeing visions . But it is all nonsense , because their minds are filled with selfish desires .
51002019	They are no longer part of Christ , who is the head of the whole body . Christ gives the body its strength , and he uses its joints and muscles to hold it together , as it grows by the power of God .
51002020	You died with Christ . Now the forces of the universe don't have any power over you . Why do you live as if you had to obey such rules as ,
51002021	“ Don't handle this . Don't taste that . Don't touch this . ” ?
51002022	After these things are used , they are no longer good for anything . So why be bothered with the rules that humans have made up ?
51002023	Obeying these rules may seem to be the smart thing to do . They appear to make you love God more and to be very humble and to have control over your body . But they don't really have any power over our desires .
51003001	You have been raised to life with Christ . Now set your heart on what is in heaven , where Christ rules at God's right side .
51003002	Think about what is up there , not about what is here on earth .
51003003	You died , which means that your life is hidden with Christ , who sits beside God .
51003004	Christ gives meaning to your life , and when he appears , you will also appear with him in glory .
51003005	Don't be controlled by your body . Kill every desire for the wrong kind of sex . Don't be immoral or indecent or have evil thoughts . Don't be greedy , which is the same as worshiping idols .
51003006	God is angry with people who disobey him by doing these things .
51003007	And this is exactly what you did , when you lived among people who behaved in this way .
51003008	But now you must stop doing such things . You must quit being angry , hateful , and evil . You must no longer say insulting or cruel things about others .
51003009	And stop lying to each other . You have given up your old way of life with its habits .
51003010	Each of you is now a new person . You are becoming more and more like your Creator , and you will understand him better .
51003011	It doesn't matter if you are a Greek or a Jew , or if you are circumcised or not . You may even be a barbarian or a Scythian , and you may be a slave or a free person . Yet Christ is all that matters , and he lives in all of us .
51003012	God loves you and has chosen you as his own special people . So be gentle , kind , humble , meek , and patient .
51003013	Put up with each other , and forgive anyone who does you wrong , just as Christ has forgiven you .
51003014	Love is more important than anything else . It is what ties everything completely together .
51003015	Each one of you is part of the body of Christ , and you were chosen to live together in peace . So let the peace that comes from Christ control your thoughts . And be grateful .
51003016	Let the message about Christ completely fill your lives , while you use all your wisdom to teach and instruct each other . With thankful hearts , sing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs to God .
51003017	Whatever you say or do should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus , as you give thanks to God the Father because of him .
51003018	A wife must put her husband first . This is her duty as a follower of the Lord .
51003019	A husband must love his wife and not abuse her .
51003020	Children must always obey their parents . This pleases the Lord .
51003021	Parents , don't be hard on your children . If you are , they might give up .
51003022	Slaves , you must always obey your earthly masters . Try to please them at all times , and not just when you think they are watching . Honor the Lord and serve your masters with your whole heart .
51003023	Do your work willingly , as though you were serving the Lord himself , and not just your earthly master .
51003024	In fact , the Lord Christ is the one you are really serving , and you know he will reward you .
51003025	But Christ has no favorites ! He will punish evil people , just as they deserve .
51004001	Slave owners , be fair and honest with your slaves . Don't forget that you have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Never give up praying . And when you pray , keep alert and be thankful .
51004003	Be sure to pray that God will make a way for us to spread his message and explain the mystery about Christ , even though I am in jail for doing this .
51004004	Please pray that I will make the message as clear as possible .
51004005	When you are with unbelievers , always make good use of the time .
51004006	Be pleasant and hold their interest when you speak the message . Choose your words carefully and be ready to give answers to anyone who asks questions .
51004007	Tychicus is the dear friend , who faithfully works and serves the Lord with us , and he will give you the news about me .
51004008	I am sending him to cheer you up by telling you how we are getting along .
51004009	Onesimus , the dear and faithful follower from your own group , is coming with him . The two of them will tell you everything that has happened here .
51004010	Aristarchus is in jail with me . He sends greetings to you , and so does Mark , the cousin of Barnabas . You have already been told to welcome Mark , if he visits you .
51004011	Jesus , who is known as Justus , sends his greetings . These three men are the only Jewish followers who have worked with me for the kingdom of God . They have given me much comfort .
51004012	Your own Epaphras , who serves Christ Jesus , sends his greetings . He always prays hard that you may fully know what the Lord wants you to do and that you may do it completely .
51004013	I have seen how much trouble he has gone through for you and for the followers in Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Our dear doctor Luke sends you his greetings , and so does Demas .
51004015	Give my greetings to the followers at Laodicea , especially to Nympha and the church that meets in her home .
51004016	After this letter has been read to your people , be sure to have it read in the church at Laodicea . And you should read the letter that I have sent to them .
51004017	Remind Archippus to do the work that the Lord has given him to do .
51004018	I am signing this letter myself : PAUL . Don't forget that I am in jail . I pray that God will be kind to you .
52001001	From Paul , Silas , and Timothy . To the church in Thessalonica , the people of God the Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ . I pray that God will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
52001002	We thank God for you and always mention you in our prayers . Each time we pray ,
52001003	we tell God our Father about your faith and loving work and about your firm hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
52001004	My dear friends , God loves you , and we know he has chosen you to be his people .
52001005	When we told you the good news , it was with the power and assurance that come from the Holy Spirit , and not simply with words . You knew what kind of people we were and how we helped you .
52001006	So , when you accepted the message , you followed our example and the example of the Lord . You suffered , but the Holy Spirit made you glad .
52001007	You became an example for all the Lord's followers in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	And because of you , the Lord's message has spread everywhere in those regions . Now the news of your faith in God is known all over the world , and we don't have to say a thing about it .
52001009	Everyone is talking about how you welcomed us and how you turned away from idols to serve the true and living God .
52001010	They also tell how you are waiting for his Son Jesus to come from heaven . God raised him from death , and on the day of judgment Jesus will save us from God's anger .
52002001	My friends , you know our time with you wasn't wasted .
52002002	As you remember , we had been mistreated and insulted at Philippi . But God gave us the courage to tell you the good news about him , even though many people caused us trouble .
52002003	We didn't have any hidden motives when we won you over , and we didn't try to fool or trick anyone .
52002004	God was pleased to trust us with his message . We didn't speak to please people , but to please God who knows our motives .
52002005	You also know we didn't try to flatter anyone . God himself knows what we did wasn't a cover-up for greed .
52002006	We were not trying to get you or anyone else to praise us .
52002007	But as apostles , we could have demanded help from you . After all , Christ is the one who sent us . We chose to be like children or like a mother nursing her baby .
52002008	We cared so much for you , and you became so dear to us , that we were willing to give our lives for you when we gave you God's message .
52002009	My dear friends , you surely haven't forgotten our hard work and hardships . You remember how night and day we struggled to make a living , so we could tell you God's message without being a burden to anyone .
52002010	Both you and God are witnesses that we were pure and honest and innocent in our dealings with you followers of the Lord .
52002011	You also know we did everything for you that parents would do for their own children .
52002012	We begged , encouraged , and urged each of you to live in a way that would honor God . He is the one who chose you to share in his own kingdom and glory .
52002013	We always thank God that you believed the message we preached . It came from him , and it isn't something made up by humans . You accepted it as God's message , and now he is working in you .
52002014	My friends , you did just like God's churches in Judea and like the other followers of Christ Jesus there . And so , you were mistreated by your own people , in the same way they were mistreated by their people .
52002015	Those evil people killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and they even chased us away . God doesn't like what they do and neither does anyone else .
52002016	They keep us from speaking his message to the Gentiles and from leading them to be saved . They have always gone too far with their sins . Now God has finally become angry and will punish them .
52002017	My friends , we were kept from coming to you for a while , but we never stopped thinking about you . We were eager to see you and tried our best to visit you in person .
52002018	We really wanted to come . I myself tried several times , but Satan always stopped us .
52002019	After all , when the Lord Jesus appears , who else but you will give us hope and joy and be like a glorious crown for us ?
52002020	You alone are our glory and joy !
52003001	Finally , we couldn't stand it any longer . We decided to stay in Athens by ourselves
52003002	and send our friend Timothy to you . He works with us as God's servant and preaches the good news about Christ . We wanted him to make you strong in your faith and to encourage you .
52003003	We didn't want any of you to be discouraged by all these troubles . You knew we would have to suffer ,
52003004	because when we were with you , we told you this would happen . And we did suffer , as you well know .
52003005	At last , when I could not wait any longer , I sent Timothy to find out about your faith . I hoped Satan had not tempted you and made all our work useless .
52003006	Timothy has now come back from his visit with you and has told us about your faith and love . He also said that you always have happy memories of us and that you want to see us as much as we want to see you .
52003007	My friends , even though we have a lot of trouble and suffering , your faith makes us feel better about you .
52003008	Your strong faith in the Lord is like a breath of new life .
52003009	How can we possibly thank God enough for all the happiness you have brought us ?
52003010	Day and night we sincerely pray that we will see you again and help you to have an even stronger faith .
52003011	We pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus will let us visit you .
52003012	May the Lord make your love for each other and for everyone else grow by leaps and bounds . This is how our love for you has grown .
52003013	And when our Lord comes with all his people , I pray he will make your hearts pure and innocent in the sight of God the Father .
52004001	Finally , my dear friends , since you belong to the Lord Jesus , we beg and urge you to live as we taught you . Then you will please God . You are already living that way , but try even harder .
52004002	Remember the instructions we gave you as followers of the Lord Jesus .
52004003	God wants you to be holy , so don't be immoral in matters of sex .
52004004	Respect and honor your wife .
52004005	Don't be a slave of your desires or live like people who don't know God .
52004006	You must not cheat any of the Lord's followers in matters of sex . Remember , we warned you that he punishes everyone who does such things .
52004007	God didn't choose you to be filthy , but to be pure .
52004008	So if you don't obey these rules , you are not really disobeying us . Instead , you are disobeying God , who gives you his Holy Spirit .
52004009	We don't have to write you about the need to love each other . God has taught you to do this ,
52004010	and you already have shown your love for all his people in Macedonia . But , my dear friends , we ask you to do even more .
52004011	Try your best to live quietly , to mind your own business , and to work hard , just as we taught you to do .
52004012	Then you will be respected by people who are not followers of the Lord , and you won't have to depend on anyone .
52004013	My friends , we want you to understand how it will be for those followers who have already died . Then you won't grieve over them and be like people who don't have any hope .
52004014	We believe Jesus died and was raised to life . We also believe that when God brings Jesus back again , he will bring with him all who had faith in Jesus before they died .
52004015	Our Lord Jesus told us that when he comes , we won't go up to meet him ahead of his followers who have already died .
52004016	With a loud command and with the shout of the chief angel and a blast of God's trumpet , the Lord will return from heaven . Then those who had faith in Christ before they died will be raised to life .
52004017	Next , all of us who are still alive will be taken up into the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the sky . From that time on we will all be with the Lord forever .
52004018	Encourage each other with these words .
52005001	I don't need to write you about the time or date when all this will happen .
52005002	You surely know that the Lord's return will be as a thief coming at night .
52005003	People will think they are safe and secure . But destruction will suddenly strike them like the pains of a woman about to give birth . And they won't escape .
52005004	My dear friends , you don't live in darkness , and so that day won't surprise you like a thief .
52005005	You belong to the light and live in the day . We don't live in the night or belong to the dark .
52005006	Others may sleep , but we should stay awake and be alert .
52005007	People sleep during the night , and some even get drunk .
52005008	But we belong to the day . So we must stay sober and let our faith and love be like a suit of armor . Our firm hope that we will be saved is our helmet .
52005009	God doesn't intend to punish us , but wants us to be saved by our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005010	Christ died for us , so we could live with him , whether we are alive or dead when he comes .
52005011	This is why you must encourage and help each other , just as you are already doing .
52005012	My friends , we ask you to be thoughtful of your leaders who work hard and tell you how to live for the Lord .
52005013	Show them great respect and love because of their work . Try to get along with each other .
52005014	My friends , we beg you to warn anyone who isn't living right . Encourage anyone who feels left out , help all who are weak , and be patient with everyone .
52005015	Don't be hateful to people , just because they are hateful to you . Rather , be good to each other and to everyone else .
52005016	Always be joyful
52005017	and never stop praying .
52005018	Whatever happens , keep thanking God because of Jesus Christ . This is what God wants you to do .
52005019	Don't turn away God's Spirit
52005020	or ignore prophecies .
52005021	Put everything to the test . Accept what is good
52005022	and don't have anything to do with evil .
52005023	I pray that God , who gives peace , will make you completely holy . And may your spirit , soul , and body be kept healthy and faultless until our Lord Jesus Christ returns .
52005024	The one who chose you can be trusted , and he will do this .
52005025	Friends , please pray for us .
52005026	Give the Lord's followers a warm greeting .
52005027	In the name of the Lord I beg you to read this letter to all his followers .
52005028	I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you !
53001001	From Paul , Silas , and Timothy . To the church in Thessalonica , the people of God our Father and of the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001002	I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
53001003	My dear friends , we always have good reason to thank God for you , because your faith in God and your love for each other keep growing all the time .
53001004	This is why we brag about you to all of God's churches . We tell them how patient you are and how you keep on having faith , even though you are going through a lot of trouble and suffering .
53001005	All this shows that God judges fairly and is making you fit to share in his kingdom for which you are suffering .
53001006	It is only right for God to punish everyone who is causing you trouble ,
53001007	but he will give you relief from your troubles . God will do the same for us , when the Lord Jesus comes from heaven with his powerful angels
53001008	and with a flaming fire . Our Lord Jesus will punish anyone who doesn't know God and won't obey his message .
53001009	Their punishment will be eternal destruction , and they will be kept far from the presence of our Lord and his glorious strength .
53001010	This will happen on the day when the Lord returns to be praised and honored by all who have faith in him and belong to him . This includes you , because you believed what we said .
53001011	God chose you , and we keep praying that God will make you worthy of being his people . We pray for God's power to help you do all the good things you hope to do and your faith makes you want to do .
53001012	Then , because of the undeserved grace of God and our Lord Jesus Christ , you will bring honor to the name of our Lord Jesus , and he will bring honor to you .
53002001	When our Lord Jesus returns , we will be gathered up to meet him . So I ask you , my friends ,
53002002	not to be easily upset or disturbed by people who claim the Lord has already come . They may say they heard this directly from the Holy Spirit , or from someone else , or even that they read it in one of our letters .
53002003	But don't be fooled ! People will rebel against God . Then before the Lord returns , the wicked one who is doomed to be destroyed will appear .
53002004	He will brag and oppose everything holy or sacred . He will even sit in God's temple and claim to be God .
53002005	Don't you remember I told you this while I was still with you ?
53002006	You already know what is holding this wicked one back until it is time for him to come .
53002007	His mysterious power is already at work , but someone is holding him back . And the wicked one won't appear until this someone is out of the way .
53002008	Then he will appear , but the Lord Jesus will kill him simply by breathing on him . He will be completely destroyed by the Lord's glorious return .
53002009	When the wicked one appears , Satan will pretend to work all kinds of miracles , wonders , and signs .
53002010	Lost people will be fooled by his evil deeds . They could be saved , but they will refuse to love the truth and accept it .
53002011	So God will make sure they are fooled into believing a lie .
53002012	All of them will be punished , because they would rather do evil than believe the truth .
53002013	My friends , the Lord loves you , and it is only natural for us to thank God for you . God chose you to be the first ones to be saved . His Spirit made you holy , and you put your faith in the truth .
53002014	God used our preaching as his way of inviting you to share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	My friends , this is why you must remain faithful and follow closely what we taught you in person and by our letters .
53002016	God our Father loves us . He treats us with undeserved grace and has given us eternal comfort and a wonderful hope . We pray that our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father
53002017	will encourage you and help you always to do and say the right thing .
53003001	Finally , our friends , please pray for us . This will help the message about the Lord to spread quickly , and others will respect it , just as you do .
53003002	Pray that we may be kept safe from worthless and evil people . After all , not everyone has faith .
53003003	But the Lord can be trusted to make you strong and protect you from harm .
53003004	He has made us sure that you are obeying what we taught you and that you will keep on obeying .
53003005	I pray that the Lord will guide you to be as loving as God and as patient as Christ .
53003006	My dear friends , in the name of the Lord Jesus , I beg you not to have anything to do with any of your people who loaf around and refuse to obey the instructions we gave you .
53003007	You surely know that you should follow our example . We didn't waste our time loafing ,
53003008	and we didn't accept food from anyone without paying for it . We didn't want to be a burden to any of you , so night and day we worked as hard as we could .
53003009	We had the right not to work , but we wanted to set an example for you .
53003010	We also gave you this rule : If you don't work , you don't eat .
53003011	Now we learn that some of you just loaf around and won't do any work , except the work of a busybody .
53003012	So , for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ , we ask and beg these people to settle down and start working for a living .
53003013	Dear friends , you must never become tired of doing right .
53003014	Be on your guard against any followers who refuse to obey what we have written in this letter . Put them to shame by not having anything to do with them .
53003015	Don't consider them your enemies . Instead , speak kindly to them as you would to any other follower .
53003016	I pray that the Lord , who gives peace , will always bless you with peace . May the Lord be with all of you .
53003017	I always sign my letters as I am now doing : PAUL .
53003018	I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to all of you .
54001001	From Paul . God our Savior and Christ Jesus commanded me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus , who gives us hope .
54001002	Timothy , because of our faith , you are like a son to me . I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind and merciful to you . May they bless you with peace !
54001003	When I was leaving for Macedonia , I asked you to stay on in Ephesus and warn certain people there to stop spreading their false teachings .
54001004	You needed to warn them to stop wasting their time on senseless stories and endless lists of ancestors . Such things only cause arguments . They don't help anyone to do God's work that can only be done by faith .
54001005	You must teach people to have genuine love , as well as a good conscience and true faith .
54001006	There are some who have given up these for nothing but empty talk .
54001007	They want to be teachers of the Law of Moses . But they don't know what they are talking about , even though they think they do .
54001008	We know the Law is good , if it is used in the right way .
54001009	We also understand it wasn't given to control people who please God , but to control lawbreakers , criminals , godless people , and sinners . It is for wicked and evil people , and for murderers , who would even kill their own parents .
54001010	The Law was written for people who are sexual perverts or who live as homosexuals or are kidnappers or liars or won't tell the truth in court . It is for anything else that opposes the correct teaching
54001011	of the good news the glorious and wonderful God has given me .
54001012	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me the strength for my work because he knew he could trust me .
54001013	I used to say terrible and insulting things about him , and I was cruel . But Christ had mercy on me because I didn't know what I was doing , and I had not yet put my faith in him .
54001014	Christ Jesus our Lord treated me with undeserved grace and has greatly blessed my life with faith and love just like his own .
54001015	“ Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners . ” This saying is true , and it can be trusted . I was the worst sinner of all !
54001016	But since I was worse than anyone else , God had mercy on me and let me be an example of the endless patience of Christ Jesus . He did this so that others would put their faith in Christ and have eternal life .
54001017	I pray that honor and glory will always be given to the only God , who lives forever and is the invisible and eternal King ! Amen .
54001018	Timothy , my son , the instructions I am giving you are based on what some prophets once said about you . If you follow these instructions , you will fight like a good soldier .
54001019	You will be faithful and have a clear conscience . Some people have made a mess of their faith because they didn't listen to their consciences .
54001020	Two of them are Hymenaeus and Alexander . I have given these men over to the power of Satan , so they will learn not to oppose God .
54002001	First of all , I ask you to pray for everyone . Ask God to help and bless them all , and tell God how thankful you are for each of them .
54002002	Pray for kings and others in power , so we may live quiet and peaceful lives as we worship and honor God .
54002003	This kind of prayer is good , and it pleases God our Savior .
54002004	God wants everyone to be saved and to know the whole truth , which is ,
54002005	There is only one God , and Christ Jesus is the only one who can bring us to God . Jesus was truly human , and he gave himself to rescue all of us .
54002006	God showed us this at the right time .
54002008	I want everyone everywhere to lift innocent hands toward heaven and pray , without being angry or arguing with each other .
54002009	I would like for women to wear modest and sensible clothes . They should not have fancy hairdos , or wear expensive clothes , or put on jewelry made of gold or pearls .
54002010	Women who claim to love God should do helpful things for others ,
54002011	and they should learn by being quiet and paying attention .
54002012	They should be silent and not be allowed to teach or to tell men what to do .
54002013	After all , Adam was created before Eve ,
54002014	and the man Adam wasn't the one who was fooled . It was the woman Eve who was completely fooled and sinned .
54002015	But women will be saved by having children , if they stay faithful , loving , holy , and modest .
54003001	It is true that anyone who desires to be a church official wants to be something worthwhile .
54003002	That's why officials must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage . They must be self-controlled , sensible , well-behaved , friendly to strangers , and able to teach .
54003003	They must not be heavy drinkers or troublemakers . Instead , they must be kind and gentle and not love money .
54003004	Church officials must be in control of their own families , and they must see that their children are obedient and always respectful .
54003005	If they don't know how to control their own families , how can they look after God's people ?
54003006	They must not be new followers of the Lord . If they are , they might become proud and be doomed along with the devil .
54003007	Finally , they must be well-respected by people who are not followers . Then they won't be trapped and disgraced by the devil .
54003008	Church officers should be serious . They must not be liars , heavy drinkers , or greedy for money .
54003009	And they must have a clear conscience and hold firmly to what God has shown us about our faith .
54003010	They must first prove themselves . Then if no one has anything against them , they can serve as officers .
54003011	Women must also be serious . They must not gossip or be heavy drinkers , and they must be faithful in everything they do .
54003012	Church officers must be faithful in marriage . They must be in full control of their children and everyone else in their home .
54003013	Those who serve well as officers will earn a good reputation and will be highly respected for their faith in Christ Jesus .
54003014	I hope to visit you soon . But I am writing these instructions ,
54003015	so if I am delayed , you will know how everyone who belongs to God's family ought to behave . After all , the church of the living God is the strong foundation of truth .
54003016	Here is the great mystery of our religion : Christ came as a human . The Spirit proved that he pleased God , and he was seen by angels . Christ was preached to the nations . People in this world put their faith in him , and he was taken up to glory .
54004001	God's Spirit clearly says that in the last days many people will turn from their faith . They will be fooled by evil spirits and by teachings that come from demons .
54004002	They will also be fooled by the false claims of liars whose consciences have lost all feeling . These liars
54004003	will forbid people to marry or to eat certain foods . But God created these foods to be eaten with thankful hearts by his followers who know the truth .
54004004	Everything God created is good . And if you give thanks , you may eat anything .
54004005	What God has said and your prayer will make it fit to eat .
54004006	If you teach these things to other followers , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus . You will show you have grown up on the teachings about our faith and on the good instructions you have obeyed .
54004007	Don't have anything to do with worthless , senseless stories . Work hard to be truly religious .
54004011	Teach these things and tell everyone to do what you say .
54004012	Don't let anyone make fun of you , just because you are young . Set an example for other followers by what you say and do , as well as by your love , faith , and purity .
54004013	Until I arrive , be sure to keep on reading the Scriptures in worship , and don't stop preaching and teaching .
54004014	Use the gift you were given when the prophets spoke and the group of church leaders blessed you by placing their hands on you .
54004015	Remember these things and think about them , so everyone can see how well you are doing .
54004016	Be careful about the way you live and about what you teach . Keep on doing this , and you will save not only yourself , but the people who hear you .
54005001	Don't correct an older man . Encourage him , as you would your own father . Treat younger men as you would your own brother ,
54005002	and treat older women as you would your own mother . Show the same respect to younger women that you would to your sister .
54005003	Take care of any widow who is really in need .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , they should learn to serve God by taking care of her , as she once took care of them . This is what God wants them to do .
54005005	A widow who is really in need is one who doesn't have any relatives . She has faith in God , and she keeps praying to him night and day , asking for his help .
54005006	A widow who thinks only about having a good time is already dead , even though she is still alive .
54005007	Tell all this to everyone , so they will do the right thing .
54005008	People who don't take care of their relatives , and especially their own families , have given up their faith . They are worse than someone who doesn't have faith in the Lord .
54005009	For a widow to be put on the list of widows , she must be at least 60 years old , and she must have been faithful in marriage .
54005010	She must also be well-known for doing all sorts of good things , such as raising children , giving food to strangers , welcoming God's people into her home , helping people in need , and always making herself useful .
54005011	Don't put young widows on the list . They may later have a strong desire to get married . Then they will turn away from Christ
54005012	and become guilty of breaking their promise to him .
54005013	Besides , they will become lazy and get into the habit of going from house to house . Next , they will start gossiping and become busybodies , talking about things that are none of their business .
54005014	I would prefer that young widows get married , have children , and look after their families . Then the enemy won't have any reason to say insulting things about us .
54005015	Look what's already happened to some of the young widows ! They have turned away to follow Satan .
54005016	If a woman who is a follower has any widows in her family , she should help them . This will keep the church from having that burden , and then the church can help widows who are really in need .
54005017	Church leaders who do their job well deserve to be paid twice as much , especially if they work hard at preaching and teaching .
54005018	It is just as the Scriptures say , “ Don't muzzle an ox when you are using it to grind grain . ” You also know the saying , “ Workers are worth their pay . ”
54005019	Don't listen to any charge against a church leader , unless at least two or three people bring the same charges .
54005020	But if any of the leaders should keep on sinning , they must be corrected in front of the whole group , as a warning to everyone else .
54005021	In the presence of God and Christ Jesus and their chosen angels , I order you to follow my instructions ! Be fair with everyone , and don't have any favorites .
54005022	Don't be too quick to accept people into the service of the Lord by placing your hands on them . Don't sin because others do , but stay close to God .
54005023	Stop drinking only water . Take a little wine to help your stomach trouble and the other illnesses you often have .
54005024	Some people get caught in their sins almost at once , even before the time of judgment . But other people's sins don't show up until later .
54005025	It is the same with good deeds . Some are easily seen , but none of them can be hidden .
54006001	If you are a slave , you should respect and honor your owner . This will keep people from saying bad things about God and about our teaching .
54006002	If any of you slaves have owners who are followers , you should show them respect . After all , they are also followers of Christ , and he loves them . So you should serve and help them the best you can . These are the things you must teach and tell the people to do .
54006003	Anyone who teaches something different disagrees with the correct and godly teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ .
54006004	Those people who disagree are proud of themselves , but they don't really know a thing . Their minds are sick , and they like to argue over words . They cause jealousy , disagreements , unkind words , evil suspicions ,
54006005	and nasty quarrels . They have wicked minds and have missed out on the truth . These people think religion is supposed to make you rich .
54006006	And religion does make your life rich , by making you content with what you have .
54006007	We didn't bring anything into this world , and we won't take anything with us when we leave .
54006008	So we should be satisfied just to have food and clothes .
54006009	People who want to be rich fall into all sorts of temptations and traps . They are caught by foolish and harmful desires that drag them down and destroy them .
54006010	The love of money causes all kinds of trouble . Some people want money so much they have given up their faith and caused themselves a lot of pain .
54006011	Timothy , you belong to God , so keep away from all these evil things . Try your best to please God and to be like him . Be faithful , loving , dependable , and gentle .
54006012	Fight a good fight for the faith and claim eternal life . God offered it to you when you clearly told about your faith , while so many people listened .
54006013	Now I ask you to make a promise . Make it in the presence of God , who gives life to all , and in the presence of Christ Jesus , who openly told Pontius Pilate about his faith .
54006014	Promise to obey completely and fully all that you have been told until our Lord Jesus Christ returns .
54006015	The glorious God is the only Ruler , the King of kings and Lord of lords . At the time that God has already decided , he will send Jesus Christ back again .
54006016	Only God lives forever ! And he lives in light that no one can come near . No human has ever seen God or ever can see him . God will be honored , and his power will last forever . Amen .
54006017	Warn the rich people of this world not to be proud or to trust in wealth that is easily lost . Tell them to have faith in God , who is rich and blesses us with everything we need to enjoy life .
54006018	Instruct them to do as many good deeds as they can and to help everyone . Remind the rich to be generous and share what they have .
54006019	This will lay a solid foundation for the future , so they will know what true life is like .
54006020	Timothy , guard what God has placed in your care ! Don't pay any attention to godless and stupid talk that sounds smart but really isn't .
54006021	Some people have even lost their faith by believing this talk . I pray that the Lord will be kind to all of you !
55001001	From Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus . God himself chose me to be an apostle , and he gave me the promised life that Jesus Christ makes possible .
55001002	Timothy , you are like a dear child to me . I pray that God our Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will be kind and merciful to you and will bless you with peace !
55001003	Night and day I mention you in my prayers . I am always grateful for you , as I pray to the God my ancestors and I have served with a clear conscience .
55001004	I remember how you cried , and I want to see you , because this would make me truly happy .
55001005	I also remember the genuine faith of your mother Eunice . Your grandmother Lois had the same sort of faith , and I am sure you have it as well .
55001006	So I ask you to make full use of the gift God gave you when I placed my hands on you . Use it well .
55001007	God's Spirit doesn't make cowards out of us . The Spirit gives us power , love , and self-control .
55001008	Don't be ashamed to speak for our Lord . And don't be ashamed of me , just because I am in jail for serving him . Use the power that comes from God and join with me in suffering for telling the good news .
55001009	God saved us and chose us to be his holy people . We did nothing to deserve this , but God planned it because he is so kind . Even before time began God planned for Christ Jesus to show kindness to us .
55001010	Now Christ Jesus has come to offer us God's gift of undeserved grace . Christ our Savior defeated death and brought us the good news . It shines like a light and offers life that never ends .
55001011	My work is to be a preacher , an apostle , and a teacher .
55001012	This is why I am suffering now . But I am not ashamed ! I know the one I have faith in , and I am sure he can guard until the last day what he has trusted me with .
55001013	Now follow the example of the correct teaching I gave you , and let the faith and love of Christ Jesus be your model .
55001014	You have been trusted with a wonderful treasure . Guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit , who lives within us .
55001015	You know that everyone in Asia has turned against me , especially Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	I pray that the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus . He often cheered me up and wasn't ashamed of me when I was put in jail .
55001017	Then after he arrived in Rome , he searched everywhere until he found me .
55001018	I pray that the Lord Jesus will ask God to show mercy to Onesiphorus on the day of judgment . You know how much he helped me in Ephesus .
55002001	Timothy , my child , you must let Christ Jesus make you strong by his gift of undeserved grace .
55002002	You have often heard me teach . Now I want you to tell these same things to followers who can be trusted to tell others .
55002003	As a good soldier of Christ Jesus you must endure your share of suffering .
55002004	Soldiers on duty don't work at outside jobs . They try only to please their commanding officer .
55002005	No one wins an athletic contest without obeying the rules .
55002006	And farmers who work hard are the first to eat what grows in their field .
55002007	If you keep in mind what I have told you , the Lord will help you understand completely .
55002008	Keep your mind on Jesus Christ ! He was from the family of David and was raised from death , just as my good news says .
55002009	And because of this message , I am locked up in jail and treated like a criminal . But God's good news isn't locked in jail ,
55002010	and so I am willing to put up with anything . Then God's special people will be saved and given eternal glory because they belong to Christ Jesus .
55002011	Here is a true message : “ If we died with Christ , we will live with him .
55002012	If we don't give up , we will rule with him . If we deny that we know him , he will deny that he knows us .
55002013	If we are not faithful , he will still be faithful . Christ cannot deny who he is . ”
55002014	Don't let anyone forget these things . And with God as your witness , you must warn them not to argue about words . These arguments don't help anyone . In fact , they ruin everyone who listens to them .
55002015	Do your best to win God's approval as a worker who doesn't need to be ashamed and who teaches only the true message .
55002016	Keep away from worthless and useless talk . It only leads people farther away from God .
55002017	That sort of talk is like a sore that won't heal . And Hymenaeus and Philetus have been talking this way
55002018	by teaching that the dead have already been raised to life . This is far from the truth , and it is destroying the faith of some people .
55002019	But the foundation God has laid is solid . On it is written , “ The Lord knows who his people are . So everyone who worships the Lord must turn away from evil . ”
55002020	In a large house some dishes are made of gold or silver , while others are made of wood or clay . Some of these are special , and others are not .
55002021	This is also how it is with people . The ones who stop doing evil and make themselves pure will become special . Their lives will be holy and pleasing to their Master , and they will be able to do all kinds of good deeds .
55002022	Run from temptations that capture young people . Always do the right thing . Be faithful , loving , and easy to get along with . Worship with people whose hearts are pure .
55002023	Stay away from stupid and senseless arguments . These only lead to trouble ,
55002024	and God's servants must not be troublemakers . They must be kind to everyone , and they must be good teachers and very patient .
55002025	Be humble when you correct people who oppose you . Maybe God will lead them to turn to him and learn the truth .
55002026	They have been trapped by the devil , and he makes them obey him , but God may help them escape .
55003001	You can be certain that in the last days there will be some very hard times .
55003002	People will love only themselves and money . They will be proud , stuck-up , rude , and disobedient to their parents . They will also be ungrateful , godless ,
55003003	heartless , and hateful . Their words will be cruel , and they will have no self-control or pity . These people will hate everything good .
55003004	They will be sneaky , reckless , and puffed up with pride . Instead of loving God , they will love pleasure .
55003005	Even though they will make a show of being religious , their religion won't be real . Don't have anything to do with such people .
55003006	Some men fool whole families , just to get power over those women who are slaves of sin and are controlled by all sorts of desires .
55003007	These women always want to learn something new , but they never can discover the truth .
55003008	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , these people are enemies of the truth . Their minds are sick , and their faith isn't real .
55003009	But they won't get very far with their foolishness . Soon everyone will know the truth about them , just as Jannes and Jambres were found out .
55003010	Timothy , you know what I teach and how I live . You know what I want to do and what I believe . You have seen how patient and loving I am , and how in the past I put up with
55003011	trouble and suffering in the cities of Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . Yet the Lord rescued me from all those terrible troubles .
55003012	In fact , anyone who belongs to Christ Jesus and wants to live right will have trouble from others .
55003013	But evil people who pretend to be what they are not will become worse than ever , as they fool others and are fooled themselves .
55003014	Keep on being faithful to what you were taught and to what you believed . After all , you know who taught you these things .
55003015	Since childhood , you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to make you wise enough to have faith in Christ Jesus and be saved .
55003016	Everything in the Scriptures is God's Word . All of it is useful for teaching and helping people and for correcting them and showing them how to live .
55003017	The Scriptures train God's servants to do all kinds of good deeds .
55004001	When Christ Jesus comes as king , he will be the judge of everyone , whether they are living or dead . So with God and Christ as witnesses , I command you
55004002	to preach God's message . Do it willingly , even if it isn't the popular thing to do . You must correct people and point out their sins . But also cheer them up , and when you instruct them , always be patient .
55004003	The time is coming when people won't listen to good teaching . Instead , they will look for teachers who will please them by telling them only what they are itching to hear .
55004004	They will turn from the truth and eagerly listen to senseless stories .
55004005	But you must stay calm and be willing to suffer . You must work hard , telling the good news and to do your job well .
55004006	Now the time has come for me to die . My life is like a drink offering being poured out on the altar .
55004007	I have fought well . I have finished the race , and I have been faithful .
55004008	So a crown will be given to me for pleasing the Lord . He judges fairly , and on the day of judgment he will give a crown to me and to everyone else who wants him to appear with power .
55004009	Come to see me as soon as you can .
55004010	Demas loves the things of this world so much that he left me and went to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus has gone to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke has stayed with me . Mark can be very helpful to me , so please find him and bring him with you .
55004012	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring the coat I left at Troas with Carpus . Don't forget to bring the scrolls , especially the ones made of leather .
55004014	Alexander , the metalworker , has hurt me in many ways . But the Lord will pay him back for what he has done .
55004015	Alexander opposes what we preach , so you had better watch out for him .
55004016	When I was first put on trial , no one helped me . In fact , everyone deserted me . I hope it won't be held against them .
55004017	But the Lord stood beside me . He gave me the strength to tell his full message , so that all Gentiles would hear it . And I was kept safe from hungry lions .
55004018	The Lord will always keep me from being harmed by evil , and he will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom . Praise him forever and ever ! Amen .
55004019	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and to the family of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed at Corinth . Trophimus was sick when I left him at Miletus .
55004021	Do your best to come before winter . Eubulus , Pudens , Linus , and Claudia send you their greetings , and so do the rest of the Lord's followers .
55004022	I pray that the Lord will bless your life and will be kind to you .
56001001	From Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ . I encourage God's own people to have more faith and to understand the truth about religion .
56001002	Then they will have the hope of eternal life God promised long ago . And God never tells a lie !
56001003	So , at the proper time , God our Savior gave this message and told me to announce what he had said .
56001004	Titus , because of our faith , you are like a son to me . I pray that God our Father and Christ Jesus our Savior will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
56001005	I left you in Crete to do what had been left undone and to appoint leaders for the churches in each town . As I told you ,
56001006	they must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage . Their children must be followers of the Lord and not have a reputation for being wild and disobedient .
56001007	Church officials are in charge of God's work , and so they must also have a good reputation . They must not be bossy , quick-tempered , heavy drinkers , bullies , or dishonest in business .
56001008	Instead , they must be friendly to strangers and enjoy doing good things . They must also be sensible , fair , pure , and self-controlled .
56001009	They must stick to the true message they were taught , so their good teaching can help others and correct everyone who opposes it .
56001010	There are many who don't respect authority , and they fool others by talking nonsense . This is especially true of some Jewish followers .
56001011	But you must make them be quiet . They are after money , and they upset whole families by teaching what they should not .
56001012	It is like one of their own prophets once said , “ The people of Crete always tell lies . They are greedy and lazy like wild animals . ”
56001013	This surely is a true saying . And you should be hard on such people , so you can help them grow stronger in their faith .
56001014	Don't pay any attention to any of those senseless Jewish stories and human commands . These are made up by people who won't obey the truth .
56001015	Everything is pure for someone whose heart is pure . But nothing is pure for an unbeliever with a dirty mind . That person's mind and conscience are destroyed .
56001016	Such people claim to know God , but their actions prove they really don't . They are disgusting . They won't obey God , and they are too worthless to do anything good .
56002001	Titus , you must teach only what is correct .
56002002	Tell the older men to have self-control and to be serious and sensible . Their faith , love , and patience must never fail .
56002003	Tell the older women to behave as those who love the Lord should . They must not gossip about others or be slaves of wine . They must teach what is proper ,
56002004	so the younger women will be loving wives and mothers .
56002005	Each of the younger women must be sensible and kind , as well as a good homemaker , who puts her own husband first . Then no one can say insulting things about God's message .
56002006	Tell the young men to have self-control in everything .
56002007	Always set a good example for others . Be sincere and serious when you teach .
56002008	Use clean language that no one can criticize . Do this , and your enemies will be too ashamed to say anything against you .
56002009	Tell slaves always to please their owners by obeying them in everything . Slaves must not talk back to their owners
56002010	or steal from them . They must be completely honest and trustworthy . Then everyone will show great respect for what is taught about God our Savior .
56002011	God has shown us undeserved grace by coming to save all people .
56002012	He taught us to give up our wicked ways and our worldly desires and to live decent and honest lives in this world .
56002013	We are filled with hope , as we wait for the glorious return of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ .
56002014	He gave himself to rescue us from everything evil and to make our hearts pure . He wanted us to be his own people and to be eager to do right .
56002015	Teach these things , as you use your full authority to encourage and correct people . Make sure you earn everyone's respect .
56003001	Remind your people to obey the rulers and authorities and not to be rebellious . They must always be ready to do something helpful
56003002	and not say cruel things or argue . They should be gentle and kind to everyone .
56003003	We used to be stupid , disobedient , and foolish , as well as slaves of all sorts of desires and pleasures . We were evil and jealous . Everyone hated us , and we hated everyone .
56003004	God our Savior showed us how good and kind he is .
56003005	He saved us because of his mercy , and not because of any good things we have done . God washed us by the power of the Holy Spirit . He gave us new birth and a fresh beginning .
56003006	God sent Jesus Christ our Savior to give us his Spirit .
56003007	Jesus treated us much better than we deserve . He made us acceptable to God and gave us the hope of eternal life . These teachings are useful and helpful for everyone . I want you to insist that the people follow them , so that all who have faith in God will be sure to do good deeds .
56003009	But don't have anything to do with stupid arguments about ancestors . And stay away from disagreements and quarrels about the Law of Moses . Such arguments are useless and senseless .
56003010	Warn troublemakers once or twice . Then don't have anything else to do with them .
56003011	You know their minds are twisted , and their own sins show how guilty they are .
56003012	I plan to send Artemas or Tychicus to you . After he arrives , please try your best to meet me at Nicopolis . I have decided to spend the winter there .
56003013	When Zenas the lawyer and Apollos get ready to leave , help them as much as you can , so they won't have need of anything .
56003014	Our people should learn to spend their time doing something useful and worthwhile .
56003015	Greetings to you from everyone here . Greet all of our friends who share in our faith . I pray that the Lord will be kind to all of you !
57001001	From Paul , who is in jail for serving Christ Jesus , and from Timothy , who is like a brother because of our faith . Philemon , you work with us and are very dear to us . This letter is to you
57001002	and to the church that meets in your home . It is also to our dear friend Apphia and to Archippus , who serves the Lord as we do .
57001003	I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace !
57001004	Philemon , each time I mention you in my prayers , I thank God .
57001005	I hear about your faith in our Lord Jesus and about your love for all God's people .
57001006	As you share your faith with others , I pray they may come to know all the blessings Christ has given us .
57001007	My friend , your love has made me happy and has greatly encouraged me . It has also cheered the hearts of God's people .
57001008	Christ gives me the courage to tell you what to do .
57001009	But I would rather ask you to do it simply because of love . Yes , as someone in jail for Christ ,
57001010	I beg you to help Onesimus ! He is like a son to me because I led him to Christ here in jail .
57001011	Before this , he was useless to you , but now he is useful both to you and to me .
57001012	Sending Onesimus back to you makes me very sad .
57001013	I would like to keep him here with me , where he could take your place in helping me while I am here in prison for preaching the good news .
57001014	But I won't do anything unless you agree to it first . I want your act of kindness to come from your heart , and not be something you feel forced to do .
57001015	Perhaps Onesimus was taken from you for a little while so you could have him back for good ,
57001016	but not as a slave . Onesimus is much more than a slave . To me he is a dear friend , but to you he is even more , both as a person and as a follower of the Lord .
57001017	If you consider me a friend because of Christ , then welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me .
57001018	If he has cheated you or owes you anything , charge it to my account .
57001019	With my own hand I write : I , PAUL , WILL PAY YOU BACK . But don't forget you owe me your life .
57001020	My dear friend and follower of Christ our Lord , please cheer me up by doing this for me .
57001021	I am sure you will do all I have asked , and even more .
57001022	Please get a room ready for me . I hope your prayers will be answered , and I can visit you .
57001023	Epaphras is also here in jail for being a follower of Christ Jesus . He sends his greetings ,
57001024	and so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , who work together with me .
57001025	I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you !
58001001	Long ago in many ways and at many times God's prophets spoke his message to our ancestors .
58001002	But now at last , God sent his Son to bring his message to us . God created the universe by his Son , and everything will someday belong to the Son .
58001003	God's Son has all the brightness of God's own glory and is like him in every way . By his own mighty word , he holds the universe together . After the Son had washed away our sins , he sat down at the right side of the glorious God in heaven .
58001004	He had become much greater than the angels , and the name he was given is far greater than any of theirs .
58001005	God has never said to any of the angels , “ You are my Son , because today I have become your Father ! ” Neither has God said to any of them , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son ! ”
58001006	When God brings his first-born Son into the world , he commands all of his angels to worship him .
58001007	And when God speaks about the angels , he says , “ I change my angels into wind and my servants into flaming fire . ”
58001008	But God says about his Son , “ You are God , and you will rule as King forever ! Your royal power brings about justice .
58001009	You loved justice and hated evil , and so I , your God , have chosen you . I appointed you and made you happier than any of your friends . ”
58001010	The Scriptures also say , “ In the beginning , Lord , you were the one who laid the foundation of the earth and created the heavens .
58001011	They will all disappear and wear out like clothes , but you will last forever .
58001012	You will roll them up like a robe and change them like a garment . But you are always the same , and you will live forever . ”
58001013	God never said to any of the angels , “ Sit at my right side until I make your enemies into a footstool for you ! ”
58001014	Angels are merely spirits sent to serve people who are going to be saved .
58002001	We must give our full attention to what we were told , so we won't drift away .
58002002	The message spoken by angels proved to be true , and all who disobeyed or rejected it were punished as they deserved .
58002003	So if we refuse this great way of being saved , how can we hope to escape ? The Lord himself was the first to tell about it , and people who heard the message proved to us that it was true .
58002004	God himself showed that his message was true by working all kinds of powerful miracles and wonders . He also gave his Holy Spirit to anyone he chose to .
58002005	We know that God did not put the future world under the power of angels .
58002006	Somewhere in the Scriptures someone says to God , “ What makes you care about us humans ? Why are you concerned for weaklings such as we ?
58002007	You made us lower than the angels for a while . Yet you have crowned us with glory and honor .
58002008	And you have put everything under our power ! ” God has put everything under our power and has not left anything out of our power . But we still don't see it all under our control .
58002009	What we do see is Jesus , who for a little while was made lower than the angels . Because of God's gift of undeserved grace , Jesus died for everyone . And now that Jesus has suffered and died , he is crowned with glory and honor !
58002010	Everything belongs to God , and all things were created by his power . So God did the right thing when he made Jesus perfect by suffering , as Jesus led many of God's children to be saved and to share in his glory .
58002011	Jesus and the people he makes holy all belong to the same family . This is why he isn't ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
58002012	He even said to God , “ I will tell them your name and sing your praises when they come together to worship . ”
58002013	He also said , “ I will trust God . ” Then he said , “ Here I am with the children God has given me . ”
58002014	We are people of flesh and blood . This is why Jesus became one of us . He died to destroy the devil , who had power over death .
58002015	But he also died to rescue all of us who live each day in fear of dying .
58002016	Jesus clearly did not come to help angels , but he did come to help Abraham's descendants .
58002017	He had to be one of us , so he could serve God as our merciful and faithful high priest and sacrifice himself for the forgiveness of our sins .
58002018	And now that Jesus has suffered and was tempted , he can help anyone else who is tempted .
58003001	My friends , God has chosen you to be his holy people . So think about Jesus , the one we call our apostle and high priest !
58003002	Jesus was faithful to God , who appointed him , just as Moses was faithful in serving all God's people .
58003003	But Jesus deserves more honor than Moses , just as the builder of a house deserves more honor than the house .
58003004	Of course , every house is built by someone , and God is really the one who built everything .
58003005	Moses was a faithful servant and told God's people what would be said in the future .
58003006	But Christ is the Son in charge of God's people . And we are those people , if we keep on being brave and don't lose hope .
58003007	It is just as the Holy Spirit says , “ If you hear God's voice today ,
58003008	don't be stubborn ! Don't rebel like those people who were tested in the desert .
58003009	For forty years your ancestors tested God and saw the things he did .
58003010	“ Then God got tired of them and said , ‘ You people never show good sense , and you don't understand what I want you to do . ’
58003011	God became angry and told the people , ‘ You will never enter my place of rest ! ’ ”
58003012	My friends , watch out ! Don't let evil thoughts or doubts make any of you turn from the living God .
58003013	You must encourage one another each day . And you must keep on while there is still a time that can be called “ today . ” If you don't , then sin may fool some of you and make you stubborn .
58003014	We were sure about Christ when we first became his people . So let's hold tightly to our faith until the end .
58003015	The Scriptures say , “ If you hear his voice today , don't be stubborn like those who rebelled . ”
58003016	Who were those people that heard God's voice and rebelled ? Weren't they the same ones that came out of Egypt with Moses ?
58003017	Who were the people that made God angry for 40 years ? Weren't they the ones that sinned and died in the desert ?
58003018	And who did God say would never enter his place of rest ? Weren't they the ones that disobeyed him ?
58003019	We see that those people did not enter the place of rest because they did not have faith .
58004001	The promise to enter the place of rest is still good , and we must take care that none of you miss out .
58004002	We have heard the message , just as they did . But they failed to believe what they heard , and the message did not do them any good .
58004003	Only people who have faith will enter the place of rest . It is just as the Scriptures say , “ God became angry and told the people , ‘ You will never enter my place of rest ! ’ ” God said this , even though everything has been ready from the time of creation .
58004004	In fact , somewhere the Scriptures say that by the seventh day , God had finished his work , and so he rested .
58004005	We also read that he later said , “ You people will never enter my place of rest ! ”
58004006	This means that the promise to enter is still good , because those who first heard about it disobeyed and did not enter .
58004007	Much later God told David to make the promise again , just as I have already said , “ If you hear his voice today , don't be stubborn ! ”
58004008	If Joshua had really given the people rest , there would not be any need for God to talk about another day of rest .
58004009	But God has promised us a Sabbath when we will rest , even though it has not yet come .
58004010	On that day God's people will rest from their work , just as God rested from his work .
58004011	We should do our best to enter the place of rest , so none of us will disobey and miss going there , as they did .
58004012	God's word is alive and powerful ! It is sharper than any double-edged sword . His word can cut through our spirits and souls and through our joints and marrow , until it discovers the desires and thoughts of our hearts .
58004013	Nothing is hidden from God ! He sees through everything , and we will have to tell him the truth .
58004014	We have a great high priest , who has gone into heaven , and he is Jesus the Son of God . This is why we must hold on to what we have said about him .
58004015	Jesus understands every weakness of ours , because he was tempted in every way that we are . But he did not sin !
58004016	So whenever we are in need , we should come bravely before the throne of our merciful God . There we will be treated with undeserved grace , and we will find help .
58005001	Every high priest is appointed to help others by offering gifts and sacrifices to God because of their sins .
58005002	A high priest has weaknesses of his own , and he feels sorry for foolish and sinful people .
58005003	This is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins and for the sins of others .
58005004	But no one can have the honor of being a high priest simply by wanting to be one . Only God can choose a priest , and God is the one who chose Aaron .
58005005	This is how it was with Christ . He became a high priest , but not just because he wanted the honor of being one . It was God who told him , “ You are my Son , because today I have become your Father ! ” “ You are a priest forever just like Melchizedek . ”
58005007	God had the power to save Jesus from death . And while Jesus was on earth , he begged God with loud crying and tears to save him . He truly worshiped God , and God listened to his prayers .
58005008	Jesus is God's own Son , but still he had to suffer before he could learn what it really means to obey God .
58005009	Suffering made Jesus perfect , and now he can save forever all who obey him .
58005010	This is because God chose him to be a high priest like Melchizedek .
58005011	Much more could be said about this subject . But it is hard to explain , and all of you are slow to understand .
58005012	By now you should have been teachers , but once again you need to be taught the simplest things about what God has said . You need milk instead of solid food .
58005013	People who live on milk are like babies who don't really know what is right .
58005014	Solid food is for mature people who have been trained to know right from wrong .
58006001	We must try to become mature and start thinking about more than just the basic things we were taught about Christ . We shouldn't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God .
58006002	And we shouldn't need to keep teaching about baptisms or about the laying on of hands or about people being raised from death and the future judgment .
58006003	Let's grow up , if God is willing .
58006007	A field is useful to farmers , if there is enough rain to make good crops grow . In fact , God will bless such a field .
58006008	But land that produces only thornbushes is worthless . It is likely to fall under God's curse , and in the end it will be set on fire .
58006009	My friends , we are talking this way . But we are sure that you are doing those really good things people do when they are being saved .
58006010	God is always fair . He will remember how you helped his people in the past and how you are still helping them . You belong to God , and he won't forget the love you have shown his people .
58006011	We wish each of you would always be eager to show how strong and lasting your hope really is .
58006012	Then you would never be lazy . You would be following the example of those who had faith and were patient until God kept his promise to them .
58006013	No one is greater than God . So he made a promise in his own name when he said to Abraham ,
58006014	“ I , the Lord , will bless you with many descendants ! ”
58006015	Then after Abraham had been very patient , he was given what God had promised .
58006016	When anyone wants to settle an argument , they make a vow by using the name of someone or something greater than themselves .
58006017	So when God wanted to prove for certain his promise to his people could not be broken , he made a vow .
58006018	God cannot tell lies ! And so his promises and vows are two things that can never be changed . We have run to God for safety . Now his promises should greatly encourage us to take hold of the hope that is right in front of us .
58006019	This hope is like a firm and steady anchor for our souls . In fact , hope reaches behind the curtain and into the most holy place .
58006020	Jesus has gone there ahead of us , and he is our high priest forever , just like Melchizedek .
58007001	Melchizedek was both king of Salem and priest of God Most High . He was the one who went out and gave Abraham his blessing , when Abraham returned from killing the kings .
58007002	Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had . The meaning of the name Melchizedek is “ King of Justice . ” But since Salem means “ peace , ” he is also “ King of Peace . ”
58007003	We are not told he had a father or mother or ancestors or beginning or end . He is like the Son of God and will be a priest forever .
58007004	Notice how great Melchizedek was ! Our famous ancestor Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had taken from his enemies .
58007005	The Law teaches that even Abraham's descendants must give a tenth of what they possess . And they are to give this to their own relatives , who are the descendants of Levi and are priests .
58007006	Although Melchizedek wasn't a descendant of Levi , Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had . Then Melchizedek blessed Abraham , who had been given God's promise .
58007007	Everyone agrees a person who gives a blessing is greater than the one who receives the blessing .
58007008	Priests are given a tenth of what people earn . But all priests die , except Melchizedek , and the Scriptures teach that he is alive .
58007009	Levi's descendants are now the ones who receive a tenth from people . We could even say that when Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth , Levi also gave him a tenth .
58007010	This is because Levi was born later into the family of Abraham , who gave a tenth to Melchizedek .
58007011	Even though the Law of Moses says the priests must be descendants of Levi , those priests cannot make anyone perfect . So there needs to be a priest like Melchizedek , rather than one from the priestly family of Aaron .
58007012	And when the rules for selecting a priest are changed , the Law must also be changed .
58007013	The person we are talking about is our Lord , who came from a tribe that had never had anyone to serve as a priest at the altar .
58007014	Everyone knows he came from the tribe of Judah , and Moses never said priests would come from that tribe .
58007015	All of this becomes clearer , when someone who is like Melchizedek is appointed to be a priest .
58007016	That person wasn't appointed because of his ancestors , but because his life can never end .
58007017	The Scriptures say about him , “ You are a priest forever , just like Melchizedek . ”
58007022	This means that Jesus guarantees us a better agreement with God .
58007023	There have been a lot of other priests , and all of them have died .
58007024	But Jesus will never die , and so he will be a priest forever !
58007025	He is forever able to save the people he leads to God , because he always lives to speak to God for them .
58007026	Jesus is the high priest we need . He is holy and innocent and faultless , and not at all like us sinners . Jesus is honored above all beings in heaven ,
58007027	and he is better than any other high priest . Jesus doesn't need to offer sacrifices each day for his own sins and then for the sins of the people . He offered a sacrifice once for all , when he gave himself .
58007028	The Law appoints priests who have weaknesses . But God's promise , which came later than the Law , appoints his Son . And he is the perfect high priest forever .
58008001	What I mean is we have a high priest who sits at the right side of God's great throne in heaven .
58008002	He also serves as the priest in the most holy place inside the real tent there in heaven . This tent of worship was set up by the Lord , not by humans .
58008003	Since all priests must offer gifts and sacrifices , Christ also needed to have something to offer .
58008004	If he were here on earth , he would not be a priest at all , because here the Law appoints other priests to offer sacrifices .
58008005	But the tent where they serve is just a copy and a shadow of the real one in heaven . Before Moses made the tent , he was told , “ Be sure to make it exactly like the pattern you were shown on the mountain ! ”
58008006	Now Christ has been appointed to serve as a priest in a much better way , and he has given us much assurance of a better agreement .
58008007	If the first agreement with God had been all right , there would not have been any need for another one .
58008008	But the Lord found fault with it and said , “ I tell you the time will come , when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah .
58008009	It won't be like the agreement that I made with their ancestors , when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt . They broke their agreement with me , and I stopped caring about them !
58008010	“ But now I tell the people of Israel this is my new agreement : ‘ The time will come when I , the Lord , will write my laws on their minds and hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
58008011	Not one of them will have to teach another to know me , their Lord . ’ “ All of them will know me , no matter who they are .
58008012	I will treat them with kindness , even though they are wicked . I will forget their sins . ”
58008013	When the Lord talks about a new agreement , he means that the first one is out of date . And anything that is old and useless will soon disappear .
58009001	The first promise included rules for worship and a tent for worship here on earth .
58009002	The first part of the tent was called the holy place , and a lampstand , a table , and the sacred loaves of bread were kept there .
58009003	Behind the curtain was the most holy place .
58009004	The gold altar for burning incense was in this holy place . The gold-covered sacred chest was also there , and inside it were three things . First , there was a gold jar filled with manna . Then there was Aaron's walking stick that sprouted . Finally , there were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments written on them .
58009005	On top of the chest were the glorious creatures with wings opened out above the place of mercy . Now isn't the time to go into detail about these things .
58009006	But this is how everything was when the priests went each day into the first part of the tent to do their duties .
58009007	However , only the high priest could go into the second part of the tent , and he went in only once a year . Each time he carried blood to offer for his sins and for any sins that the people had committed without meaning to .
58009008	All of this is the Holy Spirit's way of saying no one could enter the most holy place while the tent was still the place of worship .
58009009	This also has a meaning for today . It shows we cannot make our consciences clear by offering gifts and sacrifices .
58009010	These rules are merely about such things as eating and drinking and ceremonies for washing ourselves . And rules about physical things will last only until the time comes to change them for something better .
58009011	Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here . He also went into a much better tent that wasn't made by humans and that doesn't belong to this world .
58009012	Then Christ went once for all into the most holy place and freed us from sin forever . He did this by offering his own blood instead of the blood of goats and bulls .
58009013	According to the Law of Moses , those people who become unclean are not fit to worship God . Yet they will be considered clean , if they are sprinkled with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a sacrificed calf .
58009014	But Christ was sinless , and he offered himself as an eternal and spiritual sacrifice to God . This is why his blood is much more powerful and makes our consciences clear . Now we can serve the living God and no longer do things that lead to death .
58009015	Christ died to rescue those who had sinned and broken the old agreement . Now he brings his chosen ones a new agreement with its guarantee of God's eternal blessings !
58009016	In fact , making an agreement of this kind is like writing a will . This is because the one who makes the will must die before it is of any use .
58009017	In other words , a will doesn't go into effect as long as the one who made it is still alive .
58009018	Blood was also used to put the first agreement into effect .
58009019	Moses told the people all the Law said they must do . Then he used red wool and a hyssop plant to sprinkle the people and the book of the Law with the blood of bulls and goats and with water .
58009020	He told the people , “ With this blood God makes his agreement with you . ”
58009021	Moses also sprinkled blood on the tent and on everything else used in worship .
58009022	The Law says that almost everything must be sprinkled with blood , and no sins can be forgiven unless blood is offered .
58009023	These things are only copies of what is in heaven , and so they had to be made holy by these ceremonies . But the real things in heaven must be made holy by something better .
58009024	This is why Christ did not go into a tent made by humans and was only a copy of the real one . Instead , he went into heaven and is now there with God to help us .
58009025	Christ did not have to offer himself many times . He wasn't like a high priest who goes into the most holy place each year to offer the blood of an animal .
58009026	If he had offered himself every year , he would have suffered many times since the creation of the world . But instead , near the end of time he offered himself once and for all , so he could be a sacrifice that does away with sin .
58009027	We die only once , and then we are judged .
58009028	So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people . But when he comes again , it will not be to take away sin . He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him .
58010001	The Law of Moses is like a shadow of the good things to come . This shadow isn't the good things themselves , because it cannot free people from sin by the sacrifices offered year after year .
58010002	If there were worshipers who already have their sins washed away and their consciences made clear , there would not be any need to go on offering sacrifices .
58010005	When Christ came into the world , he said to God , “ Sacrifices and offerings are not what you want , but you have given me my body .
58010006	No , you are not pleased with animal sacrifices and offerings for sin . ”
58010007	Then Christ said , “ And so , my God , I have come to do what you want , as the Scriptures say . ”
58010008	The Law teaches that offerings and sacrifices must be made because of sin . But why did Christ mention these things and say that God did not want them ?
58010009	Well , it was to do away with offerings and sacrifices and to replace them . This is what he meant by saying to God , “ I have come to do what you want . ”
58010010	So we are made holy because Christ obeyed God and offered himself once for all .
58010011	The priests do their work each day , and they keep on offering sacrifices that can never take away sins .
58010012	But Christ offered himself as a sacrifice that is good forever . Now he is sitting at God's right side ,
58010013	and he will stay there until his enemies are put under his power .
58010014	By his one sacrifice he has forever set free from sin the people he brings to God .
58010015	The Holy Spirit also speaks of this by telling us that the Lord said ,
58010016	“ When the time comes , I will make an agreement with them . I will write my laws on their minds and hearts .
58010017	Then I will forget about their sins and no longer remember their evil deeds . ”
58010018	When sins are forgiven , there is no more need to offer sacrifices .
58010019	My friends , the blood of Jesus gives us courage to enter the most holy place
58010020	by a new way that leads to life ! And this way takes us through the curtain that is Christ himself .
58010021	We have a great high priest who is in charge of God's house .
58010022	So let's come near God with pure hearts and a confidence that comes from having faith . Let's keep our hearts pure , our consciences free from evil , and our bodies washed with clean water .
58010023	We must hold tightly to the hope we say is ours . After all , we can trust the one who made the agreement with us .
58010024	We should keep on encouraging each other to be thoughtful and to do helpful things .
58010025	Some people have given up the habit of meeting for worship , but we must not do that . We should keep on encouraging each other , especially since you know that the day of the Lord's coming is getting closer .
58010026	No sacrifices can be made for people who decide to sin after they find out about the truth .
58010027	They are God's enemies , and all they can look forward to is a terrible judgment and a furious fire .
58010028	If two or more witnesses accused someone of breaking the Law of Moses , that person could be put to death .
58010029	But it is much worse to dishonor God's Son and to disgrace the blood of the promise that made us holy . And it is just as bad to insult the Holy Spirit , who shows us mercy .
58010030	We know that God has said he will punish and take revenge . We also know that the Scriptures say the Lord will judge his people .
58010031	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God !
58010032	Don't forget all the hard times you went through when you first received the light .
58010033	Sometimes you were abused and mistreated in public , and at other times you shared in the sufferings of others .
58010034	You were kind to people in jail . And you gladly let your possessions be taken away , because you knew you had something better , something that would last forever .
58010035	Keep on being brave ! It will bring you great rewards .
58010036	Learn to be patient , so you will please God and be given what he has promised .
58010037	As the Scriptures say , “ God is coming soon ! It won't be very long .
58010038	The people God accepts will live because of their faith . But he isn't pleased with anyone who turns back . ”
58011001	Faith makes us sure of what we hope for and gives us proof of what we cannot see .
58011002	It was their faith that made our ancestors pleasing to God .
58011003	Because of our faith , we know that the world was made at God's command . We also know that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen .
58011004	Because Abel had faith , he offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did . God was pleased with him and his gift , and even though Abel is now dead , his faith still speaks for him .
58011005	Enoch had faith and did not die . He pleased God , and God took him up to heaven . This is why his body was never found .
58011006	But without faith no one can please God . We must believe that God is real and rewards everyone who searches for him .
58011007	Because Noah had faith , he was warned about something that had not yet happened . He obeyed and built a boat that saved him and his family . In this way the people of the world were judged , and Noah was given the blessings that come to everyone who pleases God .
58011008	Abraham had faith and obeyed God . He was told to go to the land that God had said would be his , and he left for a country he had never seen .
58011009	Because Abraham had faith , he lived as a stranger in the promised land . He lived there in a tent , and so did Isaac and Jacob , who were later given the same promise .
58011010	Abraham did this , because he was waiting for the eternal city God had planned and built .
58011011	Even when Sarah was too old to have children , she had faith that God would do what he had promised , and she had a son .
58011012	Her husband Abraham was almost dead , but he became the ancestor of many people . In fact , there are as many of them as there are stars in the sky or grains of sand along the seashore .
58011013	Every one of those people died . But they still had faith , even though they had not received what they had been promised . They were glad just to see these things from far away , and they agreed that they were only strangers and foreigners on this earth .
58011014	When people talk this way , it is clear they are looking for a place to call their own .
58011015	If they had been talking about the land where they had once lived , they could have gone back at any time .
58011016	But they were looking forward to a better home in heaven . This is why God wasn't ashamed for them to call him their God . He even built a city for them .
58011019	because he was sure that God could raise people to life . This was just like getting Isaac back from death .
58011020	Isaac had faith , and he promised blessings to Jacob and Esau .
58011021	Later , when Jacob was about to die , he leaned on his walking stick and worshiped . Then because of his faith he blessed each of Joseph's sons .
58011022	And right before Joseph died , he had faith that God would lead the people of Israel out of Egypt . So he told them to take his bones with them .
58011023	Because Moses' parents had faith , they kept him hidden until he was three months old . They saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid to disobey the king's orders .
58011024	Then after Moses grew up , his faith made him refuse to be called the king's grandson .
58011025	He chose to be mistreated with God's people instead of having the good time that sin could bring for a little while .
58011026	Moses knew that the treasures of Egypt were not as wonderful as what he would receive from suffering for the Messiah , and he looked forward to his reward .
58011027	Because of his faith , Moses left Egypt . Moses had seen the invisible God and wasn't afraid of the king's anger .
58011028	His faith also made him celebrate Passover . He sprinkled the blood of animals on the doorposts , so that the first-born sons of the people of Israel would not be killed by the destroying angel .
58011029	Because of their faith , the people walked through the Red Sea on dry land . But when the Egyptians tried to do it , they were drowned .
58011030	God's people had faith , and when they had walked around the city of Jericho for seven days , its walls fell down .
58011031	Rahab had been a prostitute , but she had faith and welcomed the spies . So she wasn't killed with the people who disobeyed .
58011032	What else can I say ? There isn't enough time to tell about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
58011033	Their faith helped them conquer kingdoms , and because they did right , God made promises to them . They closed the jaws of lions
58011034	and put out raging fires and escaped from the swords of their enemies . Although they were weak , they were given the strength and power to chase foreign armies away .
58011035	Some women received their loved ones back from death . Many of these people were tortured , but they refused to be released . They were sure they would get a better reward when the dead are raised to life .
58011036	Others were made fun of and beaten with whips , and some were chained in jail .
58011037	Still others were stoned to death or sawed in two or killed with swords . Some had nothing but sheep skins or goat skins to wear . They were poor , mistreated , and tortured .
58011038	The world did not deserve these good people , who had to wander in deserts and on mountains and had to live in caves and holes in the ground .
58011039	All of them pleased God because of their faith ! But still they died without being given what had been promised .
58011040	This was because God had something better in store for us . And he did not want them to reach the goal of their faith without us .
58012001	Such a large crowd of witnesses is all around us ! So we must get rid of everything that slows us down , especially the sin that just won't let go . And we must be determined to run the race that is ahead of us .
58012002	We must keep our eyes on Jesus , who leads us and makes our faith complete . He endured the shame of being nailed to a cross , because he knew later on he would be glad he did . Now he is seated at the right side of God's throne !
58012003	So keep your mind on Jesus , who put up with many insults from sinners . Then you won't get discouraged and give up .
58012004	None of you have yet been hurt in your battle against sin .
58012005	But you have forgotten that the Scriptures say to God's children , “ When the Lord punishes you , don't make light of it , and when he corrects you , don't be discouraged .
58012006	The Lord corrects the people he loves and disciplines those he calls his own . ”
58012007	Be patient when you are being corrected ! This is how God treats his children . Don't all parents correct their children ?
58012008	God corrects all his children , and if he doesn't correct you , then you don't really belong to him .
58012009	Our earthly fathers correct us , and we still respect them . Isn't it even better to be given true life by letting our spiritual Father correct us ?
58012010	Our human fathers correct us for a short time , and they do it as they think best . But God corrects us for our own good , because he wants us to be holy , as he is .
58012011	It is never fun to be corrected . In fact , at the time it is always painful . But if we learn to obey by being corrected , we will do right and live at peace .
58012012	Now stand up straight ! Stop your knees from shaking
58012013	and walk a straight path . Then lame people will be healed , instead of getting worse .
58012014	Try to live at peace with everyone ! Live a clean life . If you don't , you will never see the Lord .
58012015	Make sure no one misses out on God's wonderful kindness . Don't let anyone become bitter and cause trouble for the rest of you .
58012016	Watch out for immoral and ungodly people like Esau , who sold his future blessing for only one meal .
58012017	You know how he later wanted it back . But there was nothing he could do to change things , even though he begged his father and cried .
58012018	You have not come to a place like Mount Sinai that can be seen and touched . There is no flaming fire or dark cloud or storm
58012019	or trumpet sound . The people of Israel heard a voice speak . But they begged it to stop ,
58012020	because they could not obey its commands . They were even told to kill any animal that touched the mountain .
58012021	The sight was so frightening that Moses said he shook with fear .
58012022	You have now come to Mount Zion and to the heavenly Jerusalem . This is the city of the living God , where thousands and thousands of angels have come to celebrate .
58012023	Here you will find all of God's dearest children , whose names are written in heaven . And you will find God himself , who judges everyone . Here also are the spirits of those good people who have been made perfect .
58012024	And Jesus is here ! He is the one who makes God's new agreement with us , and his sprinkled blood says much better things than the blood of Abel .
58012025	Make sure you obey the one who speaks to you . The people did not escape , when they refused to obey the one who spoke to them at Mount Sinai . Do you think you can possibly escape , if you refuse to obey the one who speaks to you from heaven ?
58012026	When God spoke the first time , his voice shook only the earth . This time he has promised to shake the earth once again , and heaven too .
58012027	The words “ once again ” mean that these created things will someday be shaken and removed . Then what cannot be shaken will last .
58012028	We should be grateful we were given a kingdom that cannot be shaken . And in this kingdom we please God by worshiping him and by showing him great honor and respect .
58012029	Our God is like a destructive fire !
58013001	Keep being concerned about each other as the Lord's followers should .
58013002	Be sure to welcome strangers into your home . By doing this , some people have welcomed angels as guests , without even knowing it .
58013003	Remember the Lord's people who are in jail and be concerned for them . Don't forget those who are suffering , but imagine you are there with them .
58013004	Have respect for marriage . Always be faithful to your partner , because God will punish anyone who is immoral or unfaithful in marriage .
58013005	Don't fall in love with money . Be satisfied with what you have . The Lord has promised that he will not leave us or desert us .
58013006	This should make you feel like saying , “ The Lord helps me ! Why should I be afraid of what people can do to me ? ”
58013007	Don't forget about your leaders who taught you God's message . Remember what kind of lives they lived and try to have faith like theirs .
58013008	Jesus Christ never changes ! He is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
58013009	Don't be fooled by any kind of strange teachings . It is better to receive strength from God's gift of undeserved grace than to depend on certain foods . After all , these foods don't really help the people who eat them .
58013010	But we have an altar where even the priests who serve in the place of worship have no right to eat .
58013011	After the high priest offers the blood of animals as a sin offering , the bodies of those animals are burned outside the camp .
58013012	Jesus himself suffered outside the city gate , so his blood would make people holy .
58013013	This is why we should go outside the camp to Jesus and share in his disgrace .
58013014	On this earth we don't have a city that lasts forever , but we are waiting for such a city .
58013015	Our sacrifice is to keep offering praise to God in the name of Jesus .
58013016	But don't forget to help others and to share your possessions with them . This too is like offering a sacrifice that pleases God .
58013017	Obey your leaders and do what they say . They are watching over you , and they must answer to God . So don't make them sad as they do their work . Make them happy . Otherwise , they won't be able to help you at all .
58013018	Pray for us . Our consciences are clear , and we always try to live right .
58013019	I especially want you to pray that I can visit you again soon .
58013020	God gives peace , and he raised our Lord Jesus Christ from death . Now Jesus is like a Great Shepherd whose blood was used to make God's eternal agreement with his flock .
58013021	I pray God will make you ready to obey him and that you will always be eager to do right . May Jesus help you do what pleases God . To Jesus Christ be glory forever and ever ! Amen .
58013022	My friends , I have written only a short letter to encourage you , and I beg you to pay close attention to what I have said .
58013023	By now you surely must know that our friend Timothy is out of jail . If he gets here in time , I will bring him with me when I come to visit you .
58013024	Please give my greetings to your leaders and to the rest of the Lord's people . His followers from Italy send you their greetings .
58013025	I pray that God will be kind to all of you !
59001001	From James , a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ . Greetings to the twelve tribes scattered all over the world .
59001002	My friends , be glad , even if you have a lot of trouble .
59001003	You know you learn to endure by having your faith tested .
59001004	But you must learn to endure everything , so you will be completely mature and not lacking in anything .
59001005	If any of you need wisdom , you should ask God , and it will be given to you . God is generous and won't correct you for asking .
59001006	But when you ask for something , you must have faith and not doubt . Anyone who doubts is like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm .
59001009	Any of God's people who are poor should be glad he thinks so highly of them .
59001010	But any who are rich should be glad when God makes them humble . Rich people will disappear like wild flowers
59001011	scorched by the burning heat of the sun . The flowers lose their blossoms , and their beauty is destroyed . This is how the rich will disappear , as they go about their business .
59001012	God will bless you , if you don't give up when your faith is being tested . He will reward you with a glorious life , just as he rewards everyone who loves him .
59001013	Don't blame God when you are tempted ! God cannot be tempted by evil , and he doesn't use evil to tempt others .
59001014	We are tempted by our own desires that drag us off and trap us .
59001015	Our desires make us sin , and when sin is finished with us , it leaves us dead .
59001016	Don't be fooled , my dear friends .
59001017	Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father who created all the lights in the heavens . He is always the same and never makes dark shadows by changing .
59001018	He wanted us to be his own special people , and so he sent the true message to give us new birth .
59001019	My dear friends , you should be quick to listen and slow to speak or to get angry .
59001020	If you are angry , you cannot do any of the good things God wants done .
59001021	You must stop doing anything immoral or evil . Instead be humble and accept the message planted in you to save you .
59001022	Obey God's message ! Don't fool yourselves by just listening to it .
59001023	If you hear the message and don't obey it , you are like people who stare at themselves in a mirror
59001024	and forget what they look like as soon as they leave .
59001025	But you must never stop looking at the perfect law that sets you free . God will bless you in everything you do , if you listen and obey , and don't just hear and forget .
59001026	If you think you are being religious , but can't control your tongue , you are fooling yourself , and your religion is useless .
59001027	Religion that pleases God the Father must be pure and spotless . You must help needy orphans and widows and not let this world make you evil .
59002001	My friends , if you have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ , you won't treat some people better than others .
59002002	Suppose a rich person wearing fancy clothes and a gold ring comes to one of your meetings . And suppose a poor person dressed in worn-out clothes also comes .
59002003	You must not give the best seat to the one in fancy clothes and tell the one who is poor to stand at the side or sit on the floor .
59002004	This is the same as saying that some people are better than others , and you would be acting like a crooked judge .
59002005	My dear friends , pay attention . God has given a lot of faith to the poor people in this world . God has also promised them a share in his kingdom that he will give to everyone who loves him .
59002006	You mistreat the poor . But isn't it the rich who boss you around and drag you off to court ?
59002007	Aren't they the ones who make fun of your Lord ?
59002008	You will do all right , if you obey the most important law in the Scriptures . It is the law that commands us to love others as much as we love ourselves .
59002009	But if you treat some people better than others , you have done wrong , and the Scriptures teach that you have sinned .
59002010	If you obey every law except one , you are still guilty of breaking them all .
59002011	The same God who told us to be faithful in marriage also told us not to murder . So even if you are faithful in marriage , but murder someone , you still have broken God's Law .
59002012	Speak and act like people who will be judged by the law that sets us free .
59002013	Do this , because on the day of judgment there will be no pity for those who have not had pity on others . But even in judgment , God is merciful !
59002014	My friends , what good is it to say you have faith , when you don't do anything to show you really do have faith ? Can this kind of faith save you ?
59002015	If you know someone who doesn't have any clothes or food ,
59002016	you shouldn't just say , “ I hope all goes well for you . I hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat . ” What good is it to say this , unless you do something to help ?
59002017	Faith that doesn't lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead !
59002018	Suppose someone disagrees and says , “ It is possible to have faith without doing kind deeds . ” I would answer , “ Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds , and I will prove that I have faith by doing them . ”
59002019	You surely believe there is only one God . That's fine . Even demons believe this , and it makes them shake with fear .
59002020	Does some stupid person want proof that faith without deeds is useless ?
59002021	Well , our ancestor Abraham pleased God by putting his son Isaac on the altar to sacrifice him .
59002022	Now you see how Abraham's faith and deeds worked together . He proved his faith was real by what he did .
59002023	This is what the Scriptures mean by saying , “ Abraham had faith in God , and God accepted him . ” That's how Abraham became God's friend .
59002024	You can now see that we please God by what we do and not only by what we believe .
59002025	For example , Rahab had been a prostitute . But she pleased God when she welcomed the spies and sent them home by another way .
59002026	Anyone who doesn't breathe is dead , and faith that doesn't do anything is just as dead !
59003001	My friends , we should not all try to become teachers . In fact , teachers will be judged more strictly than others .
59003002	All of us do many wrong things . But if you can control your tongue , you are mature and able to control your whole body .
59003003	By putting a bit into the mouth of a horse , we can turn the horse in different directions .
59003004	It takes strong winds to move a large sailing ship , but the captain uses only a small rudder to make it go in any direction .
59003005	Our tongues are small too , and yet they brag about big things . It takes only a spark to start a forest fire !
59003006	The tongue is like a spark . It is an evil power that dirties the rest of the body and sets a person's entire life on fire with flames that come from hell itself .
59003007	All kinds of animals , birds , reptiles , and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed .
59003008	But our tongues get out of control . They are restless and evil , and always spreading deadly poison .
59003011	Can clean water and dirty water both flow from the same spring ?
59003012	Can a fig tree produce olives or a grapevine produce figs ? Does fresh water come from a well full of salt water ?
59003013	Are any of you wise or sensible ? Then show it by living right and by being humble and wise in everything you do .
59003014	But if your heart is full of bitter jealousy and selfishness , don't brag or lie to cover up the truth .
59003015	This kind of wisdom doesn't come from above . It is earthly and selfish and comes from the devil himself .
59003016	Whenever people are jealous or selfish , they cause trouble and do all sorts of cruel things .
59003017	But the wisdom that comes from above leads us to be pure , friendly , gentle , sensible , kind , helpful , genuine , and sincere .
59003018	When peacemakers plant seeds of peace , they will harvest justice .
59004001	Why do you fight and argue with each other ? Isn't it because you are full of selfish desires that fight to control your body ?
59004002	You want something you don't have , and you will do anything to get it . You will even kill ! But you still cannot get what you want , and you won't get it by fighting and arguing . You should pray for it .
59004003	Yet even when you do pray , your prayers are not answered , because you pray just for selfish reasons .
59004004	You people aren't faithful to God ! Don't you know if you love the world , you are God's enemies ? And if you decide to be a friend of the world , you make yourself an enemy of God .
59004005	Do you doubt the Scriptures that say , “ God truly cares about the Spirit he has put in us ” ?
59004006	In fact , God treats us with even greater kindness , just as the Scriptures say , “ God opposes everyone who is proud , but he blesses all who are humble with undeserved grace . ”
59004007	Surrender to God ! Resist the devil , and he will run from you .
59004008	Come near to God , and he will come near to you . Clean up your lives , you sinners . Purify your hearts , you people who can't make up your mind .
59004009	Be sad and sorry and weep . Stop laughing and start crying . Be gloomy instead of glad .
59004010	Be humble in the Lord's presence , and he will honor you .
59004011	My friends , don't say cruel things about others ! If you do , or if you condemn others , you are condemning God's Law . And if you condemn the Law , you put yourself above the Law and refuse to obey either it
59004012	or God who gave it . God is our judge , and he can save or destroy us . What right do you have to condemn anyone ?
59004013	You should know better than to say , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to the city . We will do business there for a year and make a lot of money ! ”
59004014	What do you know about tomorrow ? How can you be so sure about your life ? It is nothing more than mist that appears for only a little while before it disappears .
59004015	You should say , “ If the Lord lets us live , we will do these things . ”
59004016	Yet you are stupid enough to brag , and it is wrong to be so proud .
59004017	If you don't do what you know is right , you have sinned .
59005001	You rich people should cry and weep ! Terrible things are going to happen to you .
59005002	Your treasures have already rotted , and moths have eaten your clothes .
59005003	Your money has rusted , and the rust will be evidence against you , as it burns your body like fire . Yet you keep on storing up wealth in these last days .
59005004	You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields , and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you . The Lord All-Powerful has surely heard the cries of the workers who harvested your crops .
59005005	While here on earth , you have thought only of filling your own stomachs and having a good time . But now you are like fat cattle on their way to be butchered .
59005006	You have condemned and murdered innocent people , who couldn't even fight back .
59005007	My friends , be patient until the Lord returns . Think of farmers who wait patiently for the autumn and spring rains to make their valuable crops grow .
59005008	Be patient like those farmers and don't give up . The Lord will soon be here !
59005009	Don't grumble about each other or you will be judged , and the judge is right outside the door .
59005010	My friends , follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord . They were patient , even when they had to suffer .
59005011	In fact , we praise the ones who endured the most . You remember how patient Job was and how the Lord finally helped him . The Lord did this because he is so merciful and kind .
59005012	My friends , above all else , don't take an oath . You must not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else . “ Yes ” or “ No ” is all you need to say . If you say anything more , you will be condemned .
59005013	If you are having trouble , you should pray . And if you are feeling good , you should sing praises .
59005014	If you are sick , ask the church leaders to come and pray for you . Ask them to put olive oil on you in the name of the Lord .
59005015	If you have faith when you pray for sick people , they will get well . The Lord will heal them , and if they have sinned , he will forgive them .
59005016	If you have sinned , you should tell each other what you have done . Then you can pray for one another and be healed . The prayer of an innocent person is powerful , and it can help a lot .
59005017	Elijah was just as human as we are , and for three and a half years his prayers kept the rain from falling .
59005018	But when he did pray for rain , it fell from the skies and made the crops grow .
59005019	My friends , if any followers have wandered away from the truth , you should try to lead them back .
59005020	If you turn sinners from the wrong way , you will save them from death , and many of their sins will be forgiven .
60001001	From Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ . To God's people who are scattered like foreigners in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia .
60001002	God the Father decided to choose you as his people , and his Spirit has made you holy . You have obeyed Jesus Christ and are sprinkled with his blood . I pray that God will be kind to you and will keep on giving you peace !
60001003	Praise God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . God is so good , and by raising Jesus from death , he has given us new life and a hope that lives on .
60001004	God has something stored up for you in heaven , where it will never decay or be ruined or disappear .
60001005	You have faith in God , whose power will protect you until the last day . Then he will save you , just as he has always planned to do .
60001006	On that day you will be glad , even if you have to go through many hard trials for a while .
60001007	Your faith will be like gold that has been tested in a fire . And these trials will prove that your faith is worth much more than gold that can be destroyed . They will show that you will be given praise and honor and glory when Jesus Christ returns .
60001008	You have never seen Jesus , and you don't see him now . But still you love him and have faith in him , and no words can tell how glad and happy
60001009	you are to be saved . This is why you have faith .
60001010	Some prophets told how God would treat you with undeserved grace , and they searched hard to find out more about the way you would be saved .
60001011	The Spirit of Christ was in them and was telling them how Christ would suffer and would then be given great honor . So they searched to find out exactly who Christ would be and when this would happen .
60001012	But they were told that they were serving you and not themselves . They preached to you by the power of the Holy Spirit , who was sent from heaven . And their message was only for you , even though angels would like to know more about it .
60001013	Be alert and think straight . Put all your hope in how God will treat you with undeserved grace when Jesus Christ appears .
60001014	Behave like obedient children . Don't let your lives be controlled by your desires , as they used to be .
60001015	Always live as God's holy people should , because God is the one who chose you , and he is holy .
60001016	That's why the Scriptures say , “ I am the holy God , and you must be holy too . ”
60001017	You say that God is your Father , but God doesn't have favorites ! He judges all people by what they do . So you must honor God while you live as strangers here on earth .
60001018	You were rescued from the useless way of life you learned from your ancestors . But you know you were not rescued by such things as silver or gold that don't last forever .
60001019	You were rescued by the precious blood of Christ , that spotless and innocent lamb .
60001020	Christ was chosen even before the world was created , but because of you , he did not come until these last days .
60001021	And when he did come , it was to lead you to have faith in God , who raised him from death and honored him in a glorious way . This is why you have put your faith and hope in God .
60001022	You obeyed the truth , and your souls were made pure . Now you sincerely love each other . But you must keep on loving with all your heart .
60001023	Do this because God has given you new birth by his message that lives on forever .
60001024	The Scriptures say , “ Humans wither like grass , and their glory fades like wild flowers . Grass dries up , and flowers fall to the ground .
60001025	But what the Lord has said will stand forever . ” Our good news to you is what the Lord has said .
60002001	Stop being hateful ! Quit trying to fool people , and start being sincere . Don't be jealous or say cruel things about others .
60002002	Be like newborn babies who are thirsty for the pure spiritual milk that will help you grow and be saved .
60002003	You have already found out how good the Lord really is .
60002004	Come to Jesus Christ . He is the living stone people have rejected , but which God has chosen and highly honored .
60002005	And now you are living stones being used to build a spiritual house . You are also a group of holy priests , and with the help of Jesus Christ you will offer sacrifices that please God .
60002006	It is just as God says in the Scriptures , “ Look ! I am placing in Zion a choice and precious cornerstone . No one who has faith in this one will be disappointed . ”
60002007	You are followers of the Lord , and this stone is precious to you . But it isn't precious to those who refuse to follow him . They are the builders who tossed aside the stone that turned out to be the most important one of all .
60002008	They disobeyed the message and stumbled and fell over this stone , because they were doomed .
60002009	But you are God's chosen and special people . You are a group of royal priests and a holy nation . God has brought you out of darkness into his marvelous light . Now you must tell all the wonderful things he has done . The Scriptures say ,
60002010	“ Once you were nobody . Now you are God's people . At one time no one had mercy on you . Now God has treated you with kindness . ”
60002011	Dear friends , you are foreigners and strangers on this earth . So I beg you not to surrender to those desires that fight against you .
60002012	Always let others see you behaving properly , even though they may still accuse you of doing wrong . Then on the day of judgment , they will honor God by telling the good things they saw you do .
60002013	The Lord wants you to obey all human authorities , especially the Emperor , who rules over everyone .
60002014	You must also obey governors , because they are sent by the Emperor to punish criminals and to praise good citizens .
60002015	God wants you to silence stupid and ignorant people by doing right .
60002016	You are free , but still you are God's servants , and you must not use your freedom as an excuse for doing wrong .
60002017	Respect everyone and show special love for God's people . Honor God and respect the Emperor .
60002018	Servants , you must obey your masters and always show respect to them . Do this , not only to those who are kind and thoughtful , but also to those who are cruel .
60002019	God will bless you , even if others treat you unfairly for being loyal to him .
60002020	You don't gain anything by being punished for some wrong you have done . But God will bless you , if you have to suffer for doing something good .
60002021	After all , God chose you to suffer as you follow in the footsteps of Christ , who set an example by suffering for you .
60002022	Christ did not sin or ever tell a lie .
60002023	Although he was abused , he never tried to get even . And when he suffered , he made no threats . Instead , he had faith in God , who judges fairly .
60002024	Christ carried the burden of our sins . He was nailed to the cross , so we would stop sinning and start living right . By his cuts and bruises you are healed .
60002025	You had wandered away like sheep . Now you have returned to the one who is your shepherd and protector .
60003001	If you are a wife , you must put your husband first . Even if he opposes our message , you will win him over by what you do . No one else will have to say anything to him ,
60003002	because he will see how you honor God and live a pure life .
60003003	Don't depend on things like fancy hairdos or gold jewelry or expensive clothes to make you look beautiful .
60003004	Be beautiful in your heart by being gentle and quiet . This kind of beauty will last , and God considers it very special .
60003005	Long ago those women who worshiped God and put their hope in him made themselves beautiful by putting their husbands first .
60003006	For example , Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him her master . You are her true children , if you do right and don't let anything frighten you .
60003007	If you are a husband , you should be thoughtful of your wife . Treat her with honor , because she isn't as strong as you are , and she shares with you in the gift of life . Then nothing will stand in the way of your prayers .
60003008	Finally , all of you should agree and have concern and love for each other . You should also be kind and humble .
60003009	Don't be hateful and insult people just because they are hateful and insult you . Instead , treat everyone with kindness . You are God's chosen ones , and he will bless you . The Scriptures say ,
60003010	“ Do you really love life ? Do you want to be happy ? Then stop saying cruel things and quit telling lies .
60003011	Give up your evil ways and do right , as you find and follow the road to peace .
60003012	The Lord watches over everyone who obeys him , and he listens to their prayers . But he opposes everyone who does evil . ”
60003013	Can anyone really harm you for being eager to do good deeds ?
60003014	Even if you have to suffer for doing good things , God will bless you . So stop being afraid and don't worry about what people might do .
60003015	Honor Christ and let him be the Lord of your life . Always be ready to give an answer when someone asks you about your hope .
60003016	Give a kind and respectful answer and keep your conscience clear . This way you will make people ashamed for saying bad things about your good conduct as a follower of Christ .
60003017	You are better off to obey God and suffer for doing right than to suffer for doing wrong .
60003018	Christ died once for our sins . An innocent person died for those who are guilty . Christ did this to bring you to God , when his body was put to death and his spirit was made alive .
60003019	Christ then preached to the spirits that were being kept in prison .
60003020	They had disobeyed God while Noah was building the boat , but God had been patient with them . Eight people went into that boat and were brought safely through the flood .
60003021	Those flood waters were like baptism that now saves you . But baptism is more than just washing your body . It means turning to God with a clear conscience , because Jesus Christ was raised from death .
60003022	Christ is now in heaven , where he sits at the right side of God . All angels , authorities , and powers are under his control .
60004001	Christ suffered here on earth . Now you must be ready to suffer as he did , because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning .
60004002	It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life .
60004003	You have already lived long enough like people who don't know God . You were immoral and followed your evil desires . You went around drinking and partying and carrying on . In fact , you even worshiped disgusting idols .
60004004	Now your former friends wonder why you have stopped running around with them , and they curse you for it .
60004005	But they will have to answer to God , who judges the living and the dead .
60004006	The good news has even been preached to the dead , so that after they have been judged for what they have done in this life , their spirits will live with God .
60004007	Everything will soon come to an end . So be serious and be sensible enough to pray .
60004008	Most important of all , you must sincerely love each other , because love wipes away many sins .
60004009	Welcome people into your home and don't grumble about it .
60004010	Each of you has been blessed with one of God's many wonderful gifts to be used in the service of others . So use your gift well .
60004011	If you have the gift of speaking , preach God's message . If you have the gift of helping others , do it with the strength that God supplies . Everything should be done in a way that will bring honor to God because of Jesus Christ , who is glorious and powerful forever . Amen .
60004012	Dear friends , don't be surprised or shocked that you are going through testing that is like walking through fire .
60004013	Be glad for the chance to suffer as Christ suffered . It will prepare you for even greater happiness when he makes his glorious return .
60004014	Count it a blessing when you suffer for being a Christian . This shows that God's glorious Spirit is with you .
60004015	But you deserve to suffer if you are a murderer , a thief , a crook , or a busybody .
60004016	Don't be ashamed to suffer for being a Christian . Praise God that you belong to him .
60004017	God has already begun judging his own people . And if his judgment begins with us , imagine how terrible it will be for those who refuse to obey his message . The Scriptures say ,
60004018	“ If good people barely escape , what will happen to sinners and to others who don't respect God ? ”
60004019	If you suffer for obeying God , you must have complete faith in your faithful Creator and keep on doing right .
60005001	Church leaders , I am writing to encourage you . I too am a leader , as well as a witness to Christ's suffering , and I will share in his glory when it is shown to us .
60005002	Just as shepherds watch over their sheep , you must watch over everyone God has placed in your care . Do it willingly in order to please God , and not simply because you think you must . Let it be something you want to do , instead of something you do merely to make money .
60005003	Don't be bossy to those people who are in your care , but set an example for them .
60005004	Then when Christ the Chief Shepherd returns , you will be given a crown that will never lose its glory .
60005005	All of you young people should obey your elders . In fact , everyone should be humble toward everyone else . The Scriptures say , “ God opposes proud people , but he helps everyone who is humble . ”
60005006	Be humble in the presence of God's mighty power , and he will honor you when the time comes .
60005007	God cares for you , so turn all your worries over to him .
60005008	Be on your guard and stay awake . Your enemy , the devil , is like a roaring lion , sneaking around to find someone to attack .
60005009	But you must resist the devil and stay strong in your faith . You know that all over the world the Lord's followers are suffering just as you are .
60005010	But God shows undeserved kindness to everyone . That's why he appointed Christ Jesus to choose you to share in his eternal glory . You will suffer for a while , but God will make you complete , steady , strong , and firm .
60005011	God will be in control forever ! Amen .
60005012	Silvanus helped me write this short letter , and I consider him a faithful follower of the Lord . I wanted to encourage you and tell you how kind God really is , so you will keep on having faith in him .
60005013	Greetings from the Lord's followers in Babylon . They are God's chosen ones . Mark , who is like a son to me , sends his greetings too .
60005014	Give each other a warm greeting . I pray that God will give peace to everyone who belongs to Christ .
61001001	From Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ . To everyone who shares with us in the privilege of believing that our God and Savior Jesus Christ will do what is just and fair .
61001002	I pray that God will be kind to you and will let you live in perfect peace ! May you keep learning more and more about God and our Lord Jesus .
61001003	We have everything we need to live a life that pleases God . It was all given to us by God's own power , when we learned he had invited us to share in his wonderful goodness .
61001004	God made great and marvelous promises , so his nature would become part of us . Then we could escape our evil desires and the corrupt influences of this world .
61001005	Do your best to improve your faith by adding goodness , understanding ,
61001006	self-control , patience , devotion to God ,
61001007	concern for others , and love .
61001008	If you keep growing in this way , it will show that what you know about our Lord Jesus Christ has made your lives useful and meaningful .
61001009	But if you don't grow , you are like someone who is nearsighted or blind , and you have forgotten that your past sins are forgiven .
61001010	My friends , you must do all you can to show God has really chosen and selected you . If you keep on doing this , you won't stumble and fall .
61001011	Then our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will give you a glorious welcome into his kingdom that will last forever .
61001012	You are holding firmly to the truth you were given . But I am still going to remind you of these things .
61001013	In fact , I think I should keep on reminding you until I leave this body .
61001014	And our Lord Jesus Christ has already told me that I will soon leave it behind .
61001015	This is why I am doing my best to make sure that each of you remembers all of this after I am gone .
61001016	When we told you about the power and the return of our Lord Jesus Christ , we were not telling clever stories someone had made up . But with our own eyes we saw his true greatness .
61001017	God , our great and wonderful Father , truly honored him by saying , “ This is my own dear Son , and I am pleased with him . ”
61001018	We were there with Jesus on the holy mountain and heard this voice speak from heaven .
61001019	All of this makes us even more certain that what the prophets said is true . So you should pay close attention to their message , as you would to a lamp shining in some dark place . You must keep on paying attention until daylight comes and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	But you need to realize that no one alone can understand any of the prophecies in the Scriptures .
61001021	The prophets did not think these things up on their own , but they were guided by the Spirit of God .
61002001	Sometimes false prophets spoke to the people of Israel . False teachers will also sneak in and speak harmful lies to you . But these teachers don't really belong to the Master who paid a great price for them , and they will quickly destroy themselves .
61002002	Many people will follow their evil ways and cause others to tell lies about the true way .
61002003	They will be greedy and cheat you with smooth talk . But long ago God decided to punish them , and God doesn't sleep .
61002004	God did not have pity on the angels that sinned . He had them tied up and thrown into the dark pits of hell until the time of judgment .
61002005	And during Noah's time , God did not have pity on the ungodly people of the world . He destroyed them with a flood , though he did save eight people , including Noah , who preached the truth .
61002006	God punished the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes , and this is a warning to anyone else who wants to sin .
61002009	This shows that the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their sufferings and to punish evil people while they wait for the day of judgment .
61002010	The Lord is especially hard on people who disobey him and don't think of anything except their own filthy desires . They are reckless and proud and are not afraid of cursing the glorious beings in heaven .
61002011	Although angels are more powerful than these evil beings , even the angels don't dare to accuse them to the Lord .
61002012	These people are no better than senseless animals that live by their feelings and are born to be caught and killed . They speak evil of things they don't know anything about . But their own corrupt deeds will destroy them .
61002013	They have done evil , and they will be rewarded with evil . They think it is fun to have wild parties during the day . They are immoral , and the meals they eat with you are spoiled by the shameful and selfish way they carry on .
61002014	All they think about is having sex with someone else's husband or wife . There is no end to their wicked deeds . They trick people who are easily fooled , and their minds are filled with greedy thoughts . But they are headed for trouble !
61002015	They have left the true road and have gone down the wrong path by following the example of the prophet Balaam . He was the son of Beor and loved what he got from being a crook .
61002016	But a donkey corrected him for this evil deed . It spoke to him with a human voice and made him stop his foolishness .
61002017	These people are like dried up water holes and clouds blown by a windstorm . The darkest part of hell is waiting for them .
61002018	They brag out loud about their stupid nonsense . And by being vulgar and crude , they trap people who have barely escaped from living the wrong kind of life .
61002019	They promise freedom to everyone . But they are merely slaves of filthy living , because people are slaves of whatever controls them .
61002020	When they learned about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they escaped from the filthy things of this world . But they are again caught up and controlled by these filthy things , and now they are in worse shape than they were at first .
61002021	They would have been better off if they had never known about the right way . Even after they knew what was right , they turned their backs on the holy commandments they were given .
61002022	What happened to them is just like the true saying , “ A dog will come back to lick up its own vomit . A pig that has been washed will roll in the mud . ”
61003001	My dear friends , this is the second letter I have written to encourage you to do some honest thinking . I don't want you to forget
61003002	what God's prophets said would happen . You must never forget what the holy prophets taught in the past . And you must remember what the apostles told you our Lord and Savior has commanded us to do .
61003003	But first you must realize that in the last days some people won't think about anything except their own selfish desires . They will make fun of you
61003004	and say , “ Didn't your Lord promise to come back ? Yet the first leaders have already died , and the world hasn't changed a bit . ”
61003005	They will say this because they want to forget that long ago the heavens and the earth were made at God's command . The earth came out of water and was made from water .
61003006	Later it was destroyed by the waters of a mighty flood .
61003007	But God has commanded the present heavens and earth to remain until the day of judgment . Then they will be set on fire , and ungodly people will be destroyed .
61003008	Dear friends , don't forget that for the Lord one day is the same as 1,000 years , and 1,000 years is the same as one day .
61003009	The Lord isn't slow about keeping his promises , as some people think he is . In fact , God is patient , because he wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost .
61003010	The day of the Lord's return will surprise us like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a loud noise , and the heat will melt the whole universe . Then the earth and everything on it will be seen for what they are .
61003011	Everything will be destroyed . So you should serve and honor God by the way you live .
61003012	You should look forward to the day when God judges everyone , and you should try to make it come soon . On that day the heavens will be destroyed by fire , and everything else will melt in the heat .
61003013	But God has promised us a new heaven and a new earth , where justice will rule . We are really looking forward to this !
61003014	My friends , while you are waiting , you should make certain the Lord finds you pure , spotless , and living at peace .
61003015	Don't forget that the Lord is patient because he wants people to be saved . This is also what our dear friend Paul said when he wrote you with the wisdom God had given him .
61003016	Paul talks about these same things in all his letters , but part of what he says is hard to understand . Some ignorant and unsteady people even destroy themselves by twisting what he said . They do the same thing with other Scriptures too .
61003017	My dear friends , you have been warned ahead of time ! So don't let the errors of evil people lead you down the wrong path and make you lose your balance .
61003018	Let the gift of undeserved grace and the understanding that come from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ help you keep on growing . Praise Jesus now and forever ! Amen .
62001001	The Word that gives life was from the beginning , and this is the one our message is about . Our ears have heard , our eyes have seen , and our hands have touched this Word .
62001002	The one who gives life appeared ! We saw it happen , and we are witnesses to what we have seen . Now we are telling you about this eternal life that was with the Father and appeared to us .
62001003	We are telling you what we have seen and heard , so you may share in this life with us . And we share in it with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ .
62001004	We are writing to tell you these things , because this makes us truly happy .
62001005	Jesus told us God is light and doesn't have any darkness in him . Now we are telling you .
62001006	If we say we share in life with God and keep on living in the dark , we are lying and are not living by the truth .
62001007	But if we live in the light , as God does , we share in life with each other . And the blood of his Son Jesus washes all our sins away .
62001008	If we say we have not sinned , we are fooling ourselves , and the truth isn't in our hearts .
62001009	But if we confess our sins to God , he can always be trusted to forgive us and take our sins away .
62001010	If we say we have not sinned , we make God a liar , and his message isn't in our hearts .
62002001	My children , I am writing this so you won't sin . But if you do sin , Jesus Christ always does the right thing , and he will speak to the Father for us .
62002002	Christ is the sacrifice that takes away our sins and the sins of all the world's people .
62002003	When we obey God , we are sure we know him .
62002004	But if we claim to know him and don't obey him , we are lying and the truth isn't in our hearts .
62002005	We truly love God only when we obey him as we should , and then we know we belong to him .
62002006	If we say we are his , we must follow the example of Christ .
62002007	My dear friends , I am not writing to give you a new commandment . It is the same one you were first given , and it is the message you heard .
62002008	But it really is a new commandment , and you know its true meaning , just as Christ does . You can see the darkness fading away and the true light already shining .
62002009	If we claim to be in the light and hate someone , we are still in the dark .
62002010	But if we love others , we are in the light , and we don't cause problems for them .
62002011	If we hate others , we are living and walking in the dark . We don't know where we are going , because we can't see in the dark .
62002012	Children , I am writing you , because your sins have been forgiven in the name of Christ .
62002013	Parents , I am writing you , because you have known the one who was there from the beginning . Young people , I am writing you , because you have defeated the evil one .
62002014	Children , I am writing you , because you have known the Father . Parents , I am writing you , because you have known the one who was there from the beginning . Young people , I am writing you , because you are strong . God's message is firm in your hearts , and you have defeated the evil one .
62002015	Don't love the world or anything that belongs to the world . If you love the world , you cannot love the Father .
62002016	Our foolish pride comes from this world , and so do our selfish desires and our desire to have everything we see . None of this comes from the Father .
62002017	The world and the desires it causes are disappearing . But if we obey God , we will live forever .
62002018	Children , this is the last hour . You heard that the enemy of Christ would appear at this time , and many of Christ's enemies have already appeared . So we know the last hour is here .
62002019	These people came from our own group , yet they were not really part of us . If they had been part of us , they would have stayed with us . But they left , which proves they did not belong to our group .
62002020	Christ , the Holy One , has blessed you , and now all of you understand .
62002021	I did not need to write you about the truth , since you already know it . You also know that liars do not belong to the truth .
62002022	And a liar is anyone who says Jesus isn't truly Christ . Anyone who says this is an enemy of Christ and rejects both the Father and the Son .
62002023	If we reject the Son , we reject the Father . But if we say we accept the Son , we have the Father .
62002024	Keep thinking about the message you first heard , and you will always be one in your heart with the Son and with the Father .
62002025	The Son has promised us eternal life .
62002026	I am writing to warn you about those people who are misleading you .
62002027	But Christ has blessed you with the Holy Spirit . Now the Spirit stays in you , and you don't need any teachers . The Spirit is truthful and teaches you everything . So stay one in your heart with Christ , just as the Spirit has taught you to do .
62002028	Children , stay one in your hearts with Christ . Then when he returns , we will have confidence and won't have to hide in shame .
62002029	You know Christ always does right and everyone who does right is a child of God .
62003001	Think how much the Father loves us . He loves us so much that he lets us be called his children , as we truly are . But since the people of this world did not know who Christ is , they don't know who we are .
62003002	My dear friends , we are already God's children , though what we will be hasn't yet been seen . But we do know when Christ returns , we will be like him , because we will see him as he truly is .
62003003	This hope makes us keep ourselves holy , just as Christ is holy .
62003004	Everyone who sins breaks God's law , because sin is the same as breaking God's law .
62003005	You know Christ came to take away our sins . He isn't sinful ,
62003006	and people who stay one in their hearts with him won't keep on sinning . If they do keep on sinning , they don't know Christ , and they have never seen him .
62003007	Children , don't be fooled . Anyone who does right is good , just like Christ himself .
62003008	Anyone who keeps on sinning belongs to the devil . He has sinned from the beginning , but the Son of God came to destroy all that he has done .
62003009	God's children cannot keep on being sinful . His life-giving power lives in them and makes them his children , so they cannot keep on sinning .
62003010	You can tell God's children from the devil's children , because those who belong to the devil refuse to do right or to love each other .
62003011	From the beginning you were told we must love each other .
62003012	Don't be like Cain , who belonged to the devil and murdered his own brother . Why did he murder him ? He did it because his brother was good , and he was evil .
62003013	My friends , don't be surprised if the people of this world hate you .
62003014	Our love for each other proves we have gone from death to life . But if you don't love each other , you are still under the power of death .
62003015	If you hate each other , you are murderers , and we know murderers do not have eternal life .
62003016	We know what love is because Jesus gave his life for us . This is why we must give our lives for each other .
62003017	If we have all we need and see one of our own people in need , we must have pity on that person , or else we cannot say we love God .
62003018	Children , you show love for others by truly helping them , and not merely by talking about it .
62003019	When we love others , we know we belong to the truth , and we feel at ease in the presence of God .
62003020	But even if we don't feel at ease , God is greater than our feelings , and he knows everything .
62003021	Dear friends , if we feel at ease in the presence of God , we will have the courage to come near him .
62003022	He will give us whatever we ask , because we obey him and do what pleases him .
62003023	God wants us to have faith in his Son Jesus Christ and to love each other . This is also what Jesus taught us to do .
62003024	If we obey God's commandments , we will stay one in our hearts with him , and he will stay one with us . The Spirit he has given us is proof that we are one with him .
62004001	Dear friends , don't believe everyone who claims to have the Spirit of God . Test them all to find out if they really do come from God . Many false prophets have already gone out into the world ,
62004002	and you can know which ones come from God . His Spirit says that Jesus Christ had a truly human body .
62004003	But when someone doesn't say this about Jesus , you know this person has a spirit that doesn't come from God and is the enemy of Christ . You knew this enemy was coming into the world and now is already here .
62004004	Children , you belong to God , and you have defeated these enemies . God's Spirit is in you and is more powerful than the one who is in the world .
62004005	These enemies belong to this world , and the world listens to them , because they speak its language .
62004006	We belong to God , and everyone who knows God will listen to us . But the people who don't know God won't listen to us . This is how we can tell the Spirit that speaks the truth from the one that tells lies .
62004007	My dear friends , we must love each other . Love comes from God , and when we love each other , it shows we have been given new life . We are now God's children , and we know him .
62004008	God is love , and anyone who doesn't love others has never known him .
62004009	God showed his love for us when he sent his only Son into the world to give us life .
62004010	Real love isn't our love for God , but his love for us . God sent his Son to be the sacrifice by which our sins are forgiven .
62004011	Dear friends , since God loved us this much , we must love each other .
62004012	No one has ever seen God . But if we love each other , God lives in us , and his love is truly in our hearts .
62004013	God has given us his Spirit . This is how we know we are one with him , just as he is one with us .
62004014	God sent his Son to be the Savior of the world . We saw his Son and are now telling others about him .
62004015	God stays one with everyone who openly says Jesus is the Son of God . This is how we stay one with God
62004016	and are sure God loves us . God is love . If we keep on loving others , we will stay one in our hearts with God , and he will stay one with us .
62004017	If we truly love others and live as Christ did in this world , we won't be worried about the day of judgment .
62004018	A real love for others will chase those worries away . The thought of being punished is what makes us afraid . It shows we have not really learned to love .
62004019	We love because God loved us first .
62004020	But if we say we love God and don't love each other , we are liars . We cannot see God . So how can we love God , if we don't love the people we can see ?
62004021	The commandment that God has given us is : “ Love God and love each other ! ”
62005001	If we believe Jesus is truly Christ , we are God's children . Everyone who loves the Father will also love his children .
62005002	If we love and obey God , we know we will love his children .
62005003	We show our love for God by obeying his commandments , and they are not hard to follow .
62005004	Every child of God can defeat the world , and our faith is what gives us this victory .
62005005	No one can defeat the world without having faith in Jesus as the Son of God .
62005006	Water and blood came out from the side of Jesus Christ . It wasn't just water , but water and blood . The Spirit tells about this , because the Spirit is truthful .
62005007	In fact , there are three who tell about it .
62005008	They are the Spirit , the water , and the blood , and they all agree .
62005009	We believe what people tell us . But we can trust what God says even more , and God is the one who has spoken about his Son .
62005010	If we have faith in God's Son , we have believed what God has said . But if we don't believe what God has said about his Son , it is the same as calling God a liar .
62005011	God has also said he gave us eternal life and this life comes to us from his Son .
62005012	And so , if we have God's Son , we have this life . But if we don't have the Son , we don't have this life .
62005013	All of you have faith in the Son of God , and I have written to let you know you have eternal life .
62005014	We are certain God will hear our prayers when we ask for what pleases him .
62005015	And if we know God listens when we pray , we are sure our prayers have already been answered .
62005016	Suppose you see one of our people commit a sin that isn't a deadly sin . You can pray , and this person will be given eternal life . But the sin must not be one that is deadly .
62005017	Everything that is wrong is sin , but not all sins are deadly .
62005018	We are sure God's children do not keep on sinning . God's own Son protects them , and the devil cannot harm them .
62005019	We are certain we come from God and the rest of the world is under the power of the devil .
62005020	We know that Jesus Christ the Son of God has come and has shown us the true God . And because of Jesus , we now belong to the true God who gives eternal life .
62005021	Children , you must stay away from idols .
63001001	From the church leader . To a very special woman and her children . I truly love all of you , and so does everyone else who knows the truth .
63001002	We love you because the truth is now in our hearts , and it will be there forever .
63001003	I pray that God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son will be kind and merciful to us ! May they give us peace and truth and love .
63001004	I was very glad to learn that some of your children are obeying the truth , as the Father told us to do .
63001005	Dear friend , I am not writing to tell you and your children to do something you have not done before . I am writing to tell you to love each other , which is the first thing you were told to do .
63001006	Love means we do what God tells us . And from the beginning , he told you to love him .
63001007	Many liars have gone out into the world . These deceitful liars are saying Jesus Christ did not have a truly human body . But they are liars and the enemies of Christ .
63001008	So be sure not to lose what we have worked for . If you do , you won't be given your full reward .
63001009	Don't keep changing what you were taught about Christ , or else God will no longer be with you . But if you hold firmly to what you were taught , both the Father and the Son will be with you .
63001010	If people won't agree to this teaching , don't welcome them into your home or even greet them .
63001011	Greeting them is the same as taking part in their evil deeds .
63001012	I have much more to tell you , but I don't want to write it with pen and ink . I want to come and talk to you in person , because this will make us really happy .
63001013	Greetings from the children of your very special sister .
64001001	From the church leader . To my dear friend Gaius . I love you because we follow the truth ,
64001002	dear friend , and I pray all goes well for you . I hope you are as strong in body , as I know you are in spirit .
64001003	It makes me very happy when the Lord's followers come by and speak openly of how you obey the truth .
64001004	Nothing brings me greater happiness than to hear that my children are obeying the truth .
64001005	Dear friend , you have always been faithful in helping other followers of the Lord , even the ones you didn't know before .
64001006	They have told the church about your love . They say you were good enough to welcome them and to send them on their mission in a way God's servants deserve .
64001007	When they left to tell others about the Lord , they decided not to accept help from anyone who wasn't a follower .
64001008	We must support people like them , so we can take part in what they are doing to spread the truth .
64001009	I wrote to the church . But Diotrephes likes to be the number-one leader , and he won't pay any attention to us .
64001010	So if I come , I will remind him of how he has been attacking us with gossip . Not only has he been doing this , but he refuses to welcome any of the Lord's followers who come by . And when other church members want to welcome them , he puts them out of the church .
64001011	Dear friend , don't imitate the evil deeds of others , but follow the example of people who do kind deeds . They are God's children , but those who are always doing evil have never seen God .
64001012	Everyone speaks well of Demetrius , and so does the true message that he teaches . I also speak well of him , and you know what I say is true .
64001013	I have much more to say to you , but I don't want to write it with pen and ink .
64001014	I hope to see you soon , and then we can talk in person .
64001015	I pray that God will bless you with peace ! Your friends send their greetings . Please give a personal greeting to each of our friends .
65001001	From Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James . To all who are chosen and loved by God the Father and are kept safe by Jesus Christ .
65001002	I pray that God will greatly bless you with mercy , peace , and love !
65001003	My dear friends , I really wanted to write you about God's saving power at work in our lives . But instead , I must write and ask you to defend the faith that God has once for all given to his people .
65001004	Some godless people have sneaked in among us and are saying , “ God treats us much better than we deserve , and so it is all right to be immoral . ” They even deny we must obey Jesus Christ as our only Master and Lord . But long ago the Scriptures warned that these godless people were doomed .
65001005	Don't forget what happened to those people the Lord rescued from Egypt . Some of them did not have faith , and he later destroyed them .
65001006	You also know about the angels who didn't do their work and left their proper places . God chained them with everlasting chains and is now keeping them in dark pits until the great day of judgment .
65001007	We should also be warned by what happened to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the nearby towns . Their people became immoral and committed all sorts of sexual sins . Then God made an example of them and punished them with eternal fire .
65001008	The people I am talking about are behaving just like those dreamers who destroyed their own bodies . They reject all authority and insult angels .
65001009	Even Michael , the chief angel , didn't dare to insult the devil , when the two of them were arguing about the body of Moses . All Michael said was , “ The Lord will punish you ! ”
65001010	But these people insult powers they don't know anything about . They are like senseless animals that end up getting destroyed , because they live only by their feelings .
65001011	Now they are in for real trouble . They have followed Cain's example and have made the same mistake that Balaam did by caring only for money . They have also rebelled against God , just as Korah did . Because of all this , they will be destroyed .
65001012	These people are filthy minded , and by their shameful and selfish actions they spoil the meals you eat together . They are like clouds blown along by the wind , but never bringing any rain . They are like leafless trees , uprooted and dead , and unable to produce fruit .
65001013	Their shameful deeds show up like foam on wild ocean waves . They are like wandering stars forever doomed to the darkest pits of hell .
65001014	Enoch was the seventh person after Adam , and he was talking about these people when he said :
65001016	These people grumble and complain and live by their own selfish desires . They brag about themselves and flatter others to get what they want .
65001017	My dear friends , remember the warning you were given by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
65001018	They told you that near the end of time , selfish and godless people would start making fun of God .
65001019	And now these people are already making you turn against each other . They think only about this life , and they don't have God's Spirit .
65001020	Dear friends , keep building on the foundation of your most holy faith , as the Holy Spirit helps you to pray .
65001021	And keep in step with God's love , as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to show how kind he is by giving you eternal life .
65001022	Be helpful to all who may have doubts .
65001023	Rescue any who need to be saved , as you would rescue someone from a fire . Then with fear in your own hearts , have mercy on everyone who needs it . But hate even the clothes of those who have been made dirty by their filthy deeds .
66001001	This is what God showed to Jesus Christ , so that he could tell his servants what must happen soon . Christ then sent his angel with the message to his servant John .
66001002	And John told everything he had seen about God's message and about what Jesus Christ had said and done .
66001003	God will bless everyone who reads this prophecy to others , and he will bless everyone who hears and obeys it . The time is almost here .
66001004	From John to the seven churches in Asia . I pray that you will be blessed with kindness and peace from God , who is and was and is coming . May you receive kindness and peace from the seven spirits before the throne of God .
66001005	May kindness and peace be yours from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness . Jesus was the first to conquer death , and he is the ruler of all earthly kings . Christ loves us , and by his blood he set us free from our sins .
66001006	He lets us rule as kings and serve God his Father as priests . To him be glory and power forever and ever ! Amen .
66001007	Look ! He is coming with the clouds . Everyone will see him , even the ones who stuck a sword through him . All people on earth will weep because of him . Yes , it will happen ! Amen .
66001008	The Lord God says , “ I am Alpha and Omega , the one who is and was and is coming . I am God All-Powerful ! ”
66001009	I am John , a follower together with all of you . We suffer because Jesus is our king , but he gives us the strength to endure . I was sent to Patmos Island , because I had preached God's message and had told about Jesus .
66001010	On the Lord's day the Spirit took control of me , and behind me I heard a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet .
66001011	The voice said , “ Write in a book what you see . Then send it to the seven churches in Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia , and Laodicea . ”
66001012	When I turned to see who was speaking to me , I saw seven gold lampstands .
66001013	There with the lampstands was someone who seemed to be the Son of Man . He was wearing a robe that reached down to his feet , and a gold cloth was wrapped around his chest .
66001014	His head and his hair were white as wool or snow , and his eyes looked like flames of fire .
66001015	His feet were glowing like bronze being heated in a furnace , and his voice sounded like the roar of a waterfall .
66001016	He held seven stars in his right hand , and a sharp double-edged sword was coming from his mouth . His face was shining as bright as the sun at noon .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead person . But he put his right hand on me and said :
66002008	This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Smyrna :
66002012	This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Pergamum :
66002018	This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Thyatira :
66003007	This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Philadelphia :
66003014	This is what you must write to the angel of the church in Laodicea :
66004001	After this , I looked and saw a door that opened into heaven . Then the voice that had spoken to me at first and that sounded like a trumpet said , “ Come up here ! I will show you what must happen next . ”
66004002	Right then the Spirit took control of me , and there in heaven I saw a throne and someone sitting on it .
66004003	The one who was sitting there sparkled like precious stones of jasper and carnelian . A rainbow that looked like an emerald surrounded the throne .
66004004	Twenty-four other thrones were in a circle around that throne . And on each of these thrones there was an elder dressed in white clothes and wearing a gold crown .
66004005	Flashes of lightning and roars of thunder came out from the throne in the center of the circle . Seven torches , which are the seven spirits of God , were burning in front of the throne .
66004006	Also in front of the throne was something that looked like a glass sea , clear as crystal . Around the throne in the center were four living creatures covered front and back with eyes .
66004007	The first creature was like a lion , the second one was like a bull , the third one had the face of a human , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
66004008	Each of the four living creatures had six wings , and their bodies were covered with eyes . Day and night they never stopped singing , “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord , the all-powerful God , who was and is and is coming ! ”
66004009	The living creatures kept praising , honoring , and thanking the one who sits on the throne and who lives forever and ever .
66004010	At the same time the 24 elders knelt down before the one sitting on the throne . And as they worshiped the one who lives forever , they placed their crowns in front of the throne and said ,
66004011	“ Our Lord and God , you are worthy to receive glory , honor , and power . You created all things , and by your decision they are and were created . ”
66005001	In the right hand of the one sitting on the throne I saw a scroll that had writing on the inside and on the outside . And it was sealed in seven places .
66005002	I saw a mighty angel ask with a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? ”
66005003	No one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it .
66005004	I cried hard because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , “ Stop crying and look ! The one who is called both the ‘ Lion from the Tribe of Judah ’ and ‘ King David's Great Descendant ’ has won the victory . He will open the scroll and its seven seals . ”
66005006	Then I looked and saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb looked as if it had once been killed . It had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God , sent out to all the earth .
66005007	The Lamb went over and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat on the throne .
66005008	After he had taken it , the four living creatures and the 24 elders knelt down before him . Each of them had a harp and a gold bowl full of incense , which are the prayers of God's people .
66005009	Then they sang a new song , “ You are worthy to receive the scroll and open its seals , because you were killed . And with your own blood you bought for God people from every tribe , language , nation , and race .
66005010	You let them become kings and serve God as priests , and they will rule on earth . ”
66005011	As I looked , I heard the voices of a large number of angels around the throne and the voices of the living creatures and of the elders . There were millions and millions of them ,
66005012	and they were saying in a loud voice , “ The Lamb who was killed is worthy to receive power , riches , wisdom , strength , honor , glory , and praise . ”
66005013	Then I heard all beings in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea offer praise . Together , all of them were saying , “ Praise , honor , glory , and strength forever and ever to the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb ! ”
66005014	The four living creatures said “ Amen , ” while the elders knelt down and worshiped .
66006001	At the same time I saw the Lamb open the first of the seven seals , I heard one of the four living creatures shout with a voice like thunder . It said , “ Come out ! ”
66006002	Then I saw a white horse . Its rider carried a bow and was given a crown . He had already won some victories , and he went out to win more .
66006003	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , “ Come out ! ”
66006004	Then another horse came out . It was fiery red . And its rider was given the power to take away all peace from the earth , so people would slaughter one another . He was also given a big sword .
66006005	When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ Come out ! ” Then I saw a black horse , and its rider had a balance scale in one hand .
66006006	I heard what sounded like a voice from somewhere among the four living creatures . It said , “ A liter of wheat will cost you a whole day's wages ! Three liters of barley will cost you a day's wages too . But don't ruin the olive oil or the wine . ”
66006007	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ Come out ! ”
66006008	Then I saw a pale green horse . Its rider was named Death , and Death's Kingdom followed close behind . They were given power over one fourth of the earth , and they could kill its people with swords , famines , diseases , and wild animals .
66006009	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of everyone who had been killed for speaking God's message and telling about their faith .
66006010	They shouted , “ Master , you are holy and faithful ! How long will it be before you judge and punish the people of this earth who killed us ? ”
66006011	Then each of those who had been killed was given a white robe and told to rest for a little while . They had to wait until the complete number of the Lord's other servants and followers would be killed .
66006012	When I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal , I looked and saw a great earthquake . The sun turned as dark as sackcloth , and the moon became red as blood .
66006013	The stars in the sky fell to earth , just like figs shaken loose by a windstorm .
66006014	Then the sky was rolled up like a scroll , and all mountains and islands were moved from their places .
66006015	The kings of the earth , its famous people , and its military leaders hid in caves or behind rocks on the mountains . They hid there together with the rich and the powerful and with all the slaves and free people .
66006016	Then they shouted to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us ! Hide us from the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb .
66006017	That terrible day has come ! God and the Lamb will show their anger , and who can face it ? ”
66007003	“ Don't harm the earth or the sea or any tree ! Wait until I have marked the foreheads of the servants of our God . ”
66007004	Then I heard how many people had been marked on the forehead . There were 144,000 , and they came from every tribe of Israel :
66007005	12,000 from Judah , 12,000 from Reuben , 12,000 from Gad ,
66007006	12,000 from Asher , 12,000 from Naphtali , 12,000 from Manasseh ,
66007007	12,000 from Simeon , 12,000 from Levi , 12,000 from Issachar ,
66007008	12,000 from Zebulun , 12,000 from Joseph , and 12,000 from Benjamin .
66007009	After this , I saw a large crowd with more people than could be counted . They were from every race , tribe , nation , and language , and they stood before the throne and before the Lamb . They wore white robes and held palm branches in their hands ,
66007010	as they shouted , “ Our God , who sits upon the throne , has the power to save his people , and so does the Lamb . ”
66007011	The angels who stood around the throne knelt in front of it with their faces to the ground . The elders and the four living creatures knelt there with them . Then they all worshiped God
66007012	and said , “ Amen ! Praise , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and strength belong to our God forever and ever ! Amen ! ”
66007013	One of the elders asked me , “ Do you know who these people are that are dressed in white robes ? Do you know where they come from ? ”
66007014	“ Sir , ” I answered , “ you must know . ” Then he told me : “ These are the ones who have gone through the great suffering . They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and have made them white .
66007015	And so they stand before the throne of God and worship him in his temple day and night . The one who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them .
66007016	They will never hunger or thirst again , and they won't be troubled by the sun or any scorching heat .
66007017	The Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd . He will lead them to streams of life-giving water , and God will wipe all tears from their eyes . ”
66008001	When the Lamb opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	I noticed that the seven angels who stood before God were each given a trumpet .
66008003	Another angel , who had a gold container for incense , came and stood at the altar . This one was given a lot of incense to offer with the prayers of God's people on the gold altar in front of the throne .
66008004	Then the smoke of the incense , together with the prayers of God's people , went up to God from the hand of the angel .
66008005	After this , the angel filled the incense container with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth . Thunder roared , lightning flashed , and the earth shook .
66008006	The seven angels now got ready to blow their trumpets .
66008007	When the first angel blew his trumpet , hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth . A third of the earth , a third of the trees , and a third of all green plants were burned .
66008008	When the second angel blew his trumpet , something like a great fiery mountain was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea turned to blood ,
66008009	a third of the living creatures in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	When the third angel blew his trumpet , a great star fell from heaven . It was burning like a torch , and it fell on a third of the rivers and on a third of the springs of water .
66008011	The name of the star was Bitter , and a third of the water turned bitter . Many people died because the water was so bitter .
66008012	When the fourth angel blew his trumpet , a third of the sun , a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . They each lost a third of their light . So during a third of the day there was no light , and a third of the night was also without light .
66008013	Then I looked and saw a lone eagle flying across the sky . It was shouting , “ Trouble , trouble , trouble to everyone who lives on earth ! The other three angels are now going to blow their trumpets . ”
66009001	When the fifth angel blew his trumpet , I saw a star fall from the sky to earth . It was given the key to the tunnel that leads down to the deep pit .
66009002	As it opened the tunnel , smoke poured out like the smoke of a great furnace . The sun and the air turned dark because of the smoke .
66009003	Locusts came out of the smoke and covered the earth . They were given the same power that scorpions have .
66009004	The locusts were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or any tree . They were to punish only those people who did not have God's mark on their foreheads .
66009005	The locusts were allowed to make them suffer for five months , but not to kill them . The suffering they caused was like the sting of a scorpion .
66009006	In those days people will want to die , but they will not be able to . They will hope for death , but it will escape from them .
66009007	These locusts looked like horses ready for battle . On their heads they wore something like gold crowns , and they had human faces .
66009008	Their hair was like a woman's long hair , and their teeth were like those of a lion .
66009009	On their chests they wore armor made of iron . Their wings roared like an army of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle .
66009010	Their tails were like a scorpion's tail with a stinger that had the power to hurt someone for five months .
66009011	Their king was the angel in charge of the deep pit . In Hebrew his name was Abaddon , and in Greek it was Apollyon .
66009012	The first horrible thing has now happened ! But wait . Two more horrible things will happen soon .
66009013	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet . I heard a voice speak from the four corners of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God .
66009014	The voice spoke to this angel and said , “ Release the four angels who are tied up beside the great Euphrates River . ”
66009015	The four angels had been prepared for this very hour and day and month and year . Now they were set free to kill a third of all people .
66009016	By listening , I could tell there were more than 200,000,000 war horses .
66009017	In my vision their riders wore fiery-red , dark-blue , and yellow armor on their chests . The heads of the horses looked like lions , with fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
66009018	One third of all people were killed by the three terrible troubles caused by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
66009019	The horses had powerful mouths , and their tails were like poisonous snakes that bite and hurt .
66009020	The people who lived through these terrible troubles did not turn away from the idols they had made , and they did not stop worshiping demons . They kept on worshiping idols that were made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood . Not one of these idols could see , hear , or walk .
66009021	No one stopped murdering or practicing witchcraft or being immoral or stealing .
66010001	I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven . This one was covered with a cloud , and a rainbow was over his head . His face was like the sun , his legs were like columns of fire ,
66010002	and with his hand he held a little scroll that had been unrolled . He stood there with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
66010003	Then he shouted with a voice that sounded like a growling lion . Thunder roared seven times .
66010004	After the thunder stopped , I was about to write what it had said . But a voice from heaven shouted , “ Keep it secret ! Don't write these things . ”
66010005	The angel I had seen standing on the sea and the land then held his right hand up toward heaven .
66010006	He made a promise in the name of God who lives forever and who created heaven , earth , the sea , and every living creature . The angel said , “ You won't have to wait any longer .
66010007	God told his secret plans to his servants the prophets , and it will all happen by the time the seventh angel sounds his trumpet . ”
66010008	Once again the voice from heaven spoke to me . It said , “ Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel standing on the sea and the land . ”
66010009	When I went over to ask the angel for the little scroll , the angel said , “ Take the scroll and eat it ! Your stomach will turn sour , but the taste in your mouth will be sweet as honey . ”
66010010	I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it . The taste was sweet as honey , but my stomach turned sour .
66010011	Then some voices said , “ Keep on telling what will happen to the people of many nations , races , and languages , and also to kings . ”
66011001	An angel gave me a measuring stick and said :
66011004	These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand in the presence of the Lord who rules the earth .
66011005	Any enemy who tries to harm them will be destroyed by the fire that comes out of their mouths .
66011006	They have the power to lock up the sky and to keep rain from falling while they are prophesying . And whenever they want to , they can turn water to blood and cause all kinds of terrible troubles on earth .
66011007	After the two witnesses have finished preaching God's message , the beast that lives in the deep pit will come up and fight against them . It will win the battle and kill them .
66011008	Their bodies will be left lying in the streets of the same great city where their Lord was nailed to a cross . And this city is spiritually like the city of Sodom or the country of Egypt .
66011009	For three and a half days the people of every nation , tribe , language , and race will stare at the bodies of these two witnesses and refuse to let them be buried .
66011010	Everyone on earth will celebrate and be happy . They will give gifts to each other , because of what happened to the two prophets who caused them so much trouble .
66011011	But three and a half days later , God will breathe life into their bodies . They will stand up , and everyone who sees them will be terrified .
66011012	The witnesses then heard a loud voice from heaven , saying , “ Come up here . ” And while their enemies were watching , they were taken up to heaven in a cloud .
66011013	At that same moment there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city . Seven thousand people were killed , and the rest were frightened and praised the God who rules in heaven .
66011014	The second horrible thing has now happened ! And the third one will be here soon .
66011015	At the sound of the seventh trumpet , loud voices were heard in heaven . They said , “ Now the kingdom of this world belongs to our Lord and to his Chosen One ! And he will rule forever and ever ! ”
66011016	Then the 24 elders , who were seated on thrones in God's presence , knelt down and worshiped him .
66011017	They said , “ Lord God All-Powerful , you are and you were , and we thank you . You used your great power and started ruling .
66011018	When the nations got angry , you became angry too ! Now the time has come for the dead to be judged . It is time for you to reward your servants the prophets and all your people who honor your name , no matter who they are . It is time to destroy everyone who has destroyed the earth . ”
66011019	The door to God's temple in heaven was then opened , and the sacred chest could be seen inside the temple . I saw lightning and heard roars of thunder . The earth trembled and huge hailstones fell to the ground .
66012001	Something important appeared in the sky . It was a woman whose clothes were the sun . The moon was under her feet , and a crown made of twelve stars was on her head .
66012002	She was about to give birth , and she was crying because of the great pain .
66012003	Something else appeared in the sky . It was a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns , and a crown on each of its seven heads .
66012004	With its tail , it dragged a third of the stars from the sky and threw them down to the earth . Then the dragon turned toward the woman , because it wanted to eat her child as soon as it was born .
66012005	The woman gave birth to a son , who would rule all nations with an iron rod . The boy was snatched away . He was taken to God and placed on his throne .
66012006	The woman ran into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her . There she would be taken care of for 1,260 days .
66012007	A war broke out in heaven . Michael and his angels were fighting against the dragon and its angels .
66012008	But the dragon lost the battle . It and its angels were forced out of their places in heaven
66012009	and were thrown down to the earth . Yes , that old snake and his angels were thrown out of heaven ! That snake , who fools everyone on earth , is known as the devil and Satan .
66012010	Then I heard a voice from heaven shout , “ Our God has shown his saving power , and his kingdom has come ! God's own Chosen One has shown his authority . Satan accused our people in the presence of God day and night . Now he has been thrown out !
66012011	“ Our people defeated Satan because of the blood of the Lamb and the message of God . They were willing to give up their lives .
66012012	“ The heavens should rejoice , together with everyone who lives there . But pity the earth and the sea , because the devil was thrown down to the earth . He knows his time is short , and he is very angry . ”
66012013	When the dragon realized it had been thrown down to the earth , it tried to make trouble for the woman who had given birth to a son .
66012014	But the woman was given two wings like those of a huge eagle , so she could fly into the desert . There she would escape from the snake and be taken care of for a time , two times , and half a time .
66012015	The snake then spewed out water like a river to sweep the woman away .
66012016	But the earth helped her and swallowed the water that had come from the dragon's mouth .
66012017	This made the dragon terribly angry with the woman . So it started a war against the rest of her children . They are the people who obey God and are faithful to what Jesus did and taught .
66013001	The dragon stood on the beach beside the sea . I looked and saw a beast coming up from the sea . This one had ten horns and seven heads , and a crown was on each of its ten horns . On each of its heads were names that were an insult to God .
66013002	The beast I saw had the body of a leopard , the feet of a bear , and the mouth of a lion . The dragon handed over its own power and throne and great authority to this beast .
66013003	One of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded , but now it was well . Everyone on earth marveled at this beast ,
66013004	and they worshiped the dragon who had given its authority to the beast . They also worshiped the beast and said , “ No one is like this beast ! No one can fight against it . ”
66013005	The beast was allowed to brag and claim to be God , and for 42 months it was allowed to rule .
66013006	The beast cursed God , and it cursed the name of God . It even cursed the place where God lives , as well as everyone who lives in heaven with God .
66013007	It was allowed to fight against God's people and defeat them . It was also given authority over the people of every tribe , nation , language , and race .
66013008	The beast was worshiped by everyone whose name wasn't written before the time of creation in the book of the Lamb who was killed .
66013009	If you have ears , then listen !
66013010	If you are doomed to be captured , you will be captured . If you are doomed to be killed by a sword , you will be killed by a sword . This means God's people must learn to endure and be faithful !
66013011	I now saw another beast . This one came out of the ground . It had two horns like a lamb , but spoke like a dragon .
66013012	It worked for the beast whose fatal wound had been healed . And it used all its authority to force the earth and its people to worship that beast .
66013013	It worked mighty miracles , and while people watched , it even made fire come down from the sky .
66013014	This second beast fooled people on earth by working miracles for the first one . Then it talked them into making an idol in the form of the beast that did not die after being wounded by a sword .
66013015	It was allowed to put breath into the idol , so it could speak . Everyone who refused to worship the idol of the beast was put to death .
66013016	All people were forced to put a mark on their right hand or forehead . Whether they were powerful or weak , rich or poor , free people or slaves ,
66013017	they all had to have this mark , or else they could not buy or sell anything . This mark stood for the name of the beast and for the number of its name .
66013018	You need wisdom to understand the number of the beast ! But if you are smart enough , you can figure this out . Its number is 666 , and it stands for a person .
66014001	I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion ! With him were 144,000 , who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads .
66014002	Then I heard a sound from heaven that was like a roaring flood or loud thunder or even like the music of harps .
66014003	And a new song was being sung in front of God's throne and in front of the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn that song , except the 144,000 who had been rescued from the earth .
66014004	All of these are pure virgins , and they follow the Lamb wherever he leads . They have been rescued to be presented to God and the Lamb as the most precious people on earth .
66014005	They never tell lies , and they are innocent .
66014006	I saw another angel . This one was flying across the sky and had the eternal good news to announce to the people of every race , tribe , language , and nation on earth .
66014007	The angel shouted , “ Worship and honor God ! The time has come for him to judge everyone . Kneel down before the one who created heaven and earth , the oceans , and every stream . ”
66014008	A second angel followed and said , “ The great city of Babylon has fallen ! This is the city that made all nations drunk and immoral . Now God is angry , and Babylon has fallen . ”
66014009	Finally , a third angel came and shouted :
66014012	God's people must learn to endure . They must also obey his commands and have faith in Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Put this in writing . From now on , the Lord will bless everyone who has faith in him when they die . ” The Spirit answered , “ Yes , they will rest from their hard work , and they will be rewarded for what they have done . ”
66014014	I looked and saw a bright cloud , and someone who seemed to be the Son of Man was sitting on the cloud . He wore a gold crown on his head and held a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	An angel came out of the temple and shouted , “ Start cutting with your sickle ! Harvest season is here , and all crops on earth are ripe . ”
66014016	The one on the cloud swung his sickle and harvested the crops .
66014017	Another angel with a sharp sickle then came out of the temple in heaven .
66014018	After this , an angel with power over fire came from the altar and shouted to the angel who had the sickle . He said , “ All grapes on earth are ripe ! Harvest them with your sharp sickle . ”
66014019	The angel swung his sickle on earth and cut off its grapes . He threw them into a pit where they were trampled on as a sign of God's anger .
66014020	The pit was outside the city , and when the grapes were mashed , blood flowed out . The blood turned into a river that was about 300 kilometers long and almost deep enough to cover a horse .
66015001	After this , I looked at the sky and saw something else that was strange and important . Seven angels were bringing the seven last terrible troubles . When these are ended , God will no longer be angry .
66015002	Then I saw something that looked like a glass sea mixed with fire , and people were standing on it . They were the ones who had defeated the beast and the idol and the number that tells the name of the beast . God had given them harps ,
66015003	and they were singing the song his servant Moses and the Lamb had sung . They were singing , “ Lord God All-Powerful , you have done great and marvelous things . You are the ruler of all nations , and you do what is right and fair .
66015004	Lord , who doesn't honor and praise your name ? You alone are holy , and all nations will come and worship you , because you have shown that you judge with fairness . ”
66015005	After this , I noticed something else in heaven . The sacred tent used for a temple was open .
66015006	And the seven angels who were bringing the terrible troubles were coming out of it . They were dressed in robes of pure white linen and wore belts made of pure gold .
66015007	One of the four living creatures gave each of the seven angels a bowl made of gold . These bowls were filled with the anger of God who lives forever and ever .
66015008	The temple quickly filled with smoke from the glory and power of God . No one could enter it until the seven angels had finished pouring out the seven last troubles .
66016001	From the temple I heard a voice shout to the seven angels , “ Go and empty the seven bowls of God's anger on the earth . ”
66016002	The first angel emptied his bowl on the earth . At once ugly and painful sores broke out on everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the idol .
66016003	The second angel emptied his bowl on the sea . At once the sea turned into blood like that of a dead person , and every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	The third angel emptied his bowl into the rivers and streams . At once they turned to blood .
66016005	Then I heard the angel , who has power over water , say , “ You have always been , and you always will be the holy God . You had the right to judge in this way .
66016006	They poured out the blood of your people and your prophets . So you gave them blood to drink as they deserve ! ”
66016007	After this , I heard the altar shout , “ Yes , Lord God All-Powerful , your judgments are honest and fair . ”
66016008	The fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun , and it began to scorch people like fire .
66016009	Everyone was scorched by its great heat , and all of them cursed the name of God who had power over these terrible troubles . But no one turned to God and praised him .
66016010	The fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast . At once darkness covered its kingdom , and its people began biting their tongues in pain .
66016011	And because of their painful sores , they cursed the God who rules in heaven . But still they did not stop doing evil things .
66016012	The sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great Euphrates River , and it completely dried up to make a road for the kings from the east .
66016013	An evil spirit that looked like a frog came out of the mouth of the dragon . One also came out of the mouth of the beast , and another out of the mouth of the false prophet .
66016014	These evil spirits had the power to work miracles . They went to every king on earth , to bring them together for a war against God All-Powerful . But that will be the day of God's great victory .
66016015	Remember Christ says , “ When I come , it will surprise you like a thief ! But God will bless you , if you are awake and ready . Then you won't have to walk around naked and be ashamed . ”
66016016	Those armies came together in a place that in Hebrew is called Armagedon .
66016017	As soon as the seventh angel emptied his bowl in the air , a loud voice from the throne in the temple shouted , “ It's done ! ”
66016018	There were flashes of lightning , roars of thunder , and the worst earthquake in all history .
66016019	The great city of Babylon split into three parts , and the cities of other nations fell . So God made Babylon drink from the wine cup filled with his anger .
66016020	Every island ran away , and the mountains disappeared .
66016021	Hailstones , weighing about 50 kilograms each , fell from the sky on people . Finally , the people cursed God , because the hail was so terrible .
66017001	One of the seven angels who had emptied the bowls came over and said to me , “ Come on ! I will show you how God will punish that shameless prostitute who sits on many oceans .
66017002	Every king on earth has slept with her , and her shameless ways are like wine that has made everyone on earth drunk . ”
66017003	With the help of the Spirit , the angel took me into a desert , where I saw a woman sitting on a red beast . The beast was covered with names that were an insult to God , and it had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet robes , and she wore jewelry made of gold , precious stones , and pearls . In her hand she held a gold cup filled with the filthy and nasty things she had done .
66017005	On her forehead a mysterious name was written :
66018001	I saw another angel come from heaven . This one had great power , and the earth was bright because of his glory .
66018002	The angel shouted , “ Fallen ! Powerful Babylon has fallen and is now the home of demons . It is the den of every filthy spirit and of all unclean birds , and every dirty and hated animal .
66018003	Babylon's evil and immoral wine has made all nations drunk . Every king on earth has slept with her , and every merchant on earth is rich because of her evil desires . ”
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven shout , “ My people , you must escape from Babylon . Don't take part in her sins and share her punishment .
66018005	Her sins are piled as high as heaven . God has remembered the evil she has done .
66018006	Treat her as she has treated others . Make her pay double for what she has done . Make her drink twice as much of what she mixed for others .
66018007	That woman honored herself with a life of luxury . Reward her now with suffering and pain . “ Deep in her heart Babylon said , ‘ I am the queen ! Never will I be a widow or know what it means to be sad . ’
66018008	And so , in a single day she will suffer the pain of sorrow , hunger , and death . Fire will destroy her dead body , because her judge is the powerful Lord God . ”
66018009	Every king on earth who slept with her and shared in her luxury will mourn . They will weep , when they see the smoke from that fire .
66018010	Her sufferings will frighten them , and they will stand at a distance and say , “ Pity that great and powerful city ! Pity Babylon ! In a single hour her judgment has come . ”
66018011	Every merchant on earth will mourn , because there is no one to buy their goods .
66018012	There won't be anyone to buy their gold , silver , jewels , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , scarlet cloth , sweet-smelling wood , fancy carvings of ivory and wood , as well as things made of bronze , iron , or marble .
66018013	No one will buy their cinnamon , spices , incense , myrrh , frankincense , wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , chariots , slaves , and other humans .
66018014	Babylon , the things your heart desired have all escaped from you . Every luxury and all your glory will be lost forever . You will never get them back .
66018015	The merchants had become rich because of her . But when they saw her sufferings , they were terrified . They stood at a distance , crying and mourning .
66018016	Then they shouted , “ Pity the great city of Babylon ! She dressed in fine linen and wore purple and scarlet cloth . She had jewelry made of gold and precious stones and pearls .
66018017	Yet in a single hour her riches disappeared . ” Every ship captain and passenger and sailor stood at a distance , together with everyone who does business by traveling on the sea .
66018018	When they saw the smoke from her fire , they shouted , “ This was the greatest city ever ! ”
66018019	They cried loudly , and in their sorrow they threw dust on their heads , as they said , “ Pity the great city of Babylon ! Everyone who sailed the seas became rich from her treasures . But in a single hour the city was destroyed .
66018020	The heavens should be happy with God's people and apostles and prophets . God has punished her for them . ”
66018021	A powerful angel then picked up a huge stone and threw it into the sea . The angel said , “ This is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down , never to rise again .
66018022	The music of harps and singers and of flutes and trumpets will no longer be heard . No workers will ever set up shop in that city , and the sound of grinding grain will be silenced forever .
66018023	Lamps will no longer shine anywhere in Babylon , and couples will never again say wedding vows there . Her merchants ruled the earth , and by her witchcraft she fooled all nations .
66018024	On the streets of Babylon is found the blood of God's people and of his prophets , and everyone else . ”
66019001	After this , I heard what sounded like a lot of voices in heaven , and they were shouting , “ Praise the Lord ! To our God belongs the glorious power to save ,
66019002	because his judgments are honest and fair . That filthy prostitute ruined the earth with shameful deeds . But God has judged her and made her pay the price for murdering his servants . ”
66019003	Then the crowd shouted , “ Praise the Lord ! Smoke will never stop rising from her burning body . ”
66019004	After this , the 24 elders and the four living creatures all knelt before the throne of God and worshiped him . They said , “ Amen ! Praise the Lord ! ”
66019005	From the throne a voice said , “ If you worship and fear our God , give praise to him , no matter who you are . ”
66019006	Then I heard what seemed to be a large crowd that sounded like a roaring flood and loud thunder all mixed together . They were saying , “ Praise the Lord ! Our Lord God All-Powerful now rules as king .
66019007	So we will be glad and happy and give him praise . The wedding day of the Lamb is here , and his bride is ready .
66019008	She will be given a wedding dress made of pure and shining linen . This linen stands for the good things God's people have done . ”
66019009	Then the angel told me , “ Put this in writing . God will bless everyone who is invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb . ” The angel also said , “ These things God has said are true . ”
66019010	I knelt at the feet of the angel and began to worship him . But the angel said , “ Don't do that ! I am a servant , just like you and everyone else who tells about Jesus . Don't worship anyone but God . Everyone who tells about Jesus does it by the power of the Spirit . ”
66019011	I looked and saw heaven was open , and a white horse was there . Its rider was called Faithful and True , and he is always fair when he judges or goes to war .
66019012	He had eyes like flames of fire , and he was wearing a lot of crowns . His name was written on him , but he was the only one who knew what the name meant .
66019013	The rider wore a robe that was covered with blood , and he was known as “ The Word of God . ”
66019014	He was followed by armies from heaven that rode on white horses and were dressed in pure white linen .
66019015	From his mouth a sharp sword went out to attack the nations . He will rule them with an iron rod and will show the fierce anger of God All-Powerful by trampling the grapes in the pit where wine is made .
66019016	On the part of the robe that covered his thigh was written , “ KING OF KINGS AND
66019017	I then saw an angel standing on the sun , and he shouted to all the birds flying in the sky , “ Come and join in God's great feast !
66019018	You can eat the flesh of kings , rulers , leaders , horses , riders , free people , slaves , important people , and everyone else . ”
66019019	I also saw the beast and all kings of the earth come together . They fought against the rider on the white horse and against his army .
66019020	But the beast was captured and so was the false prophet . This is the same prophet who had worked miracles for the beast , so he could fool everyone who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the idol . The beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into a lake of burning sulfur .
66019021	But the rest of their army was killed by the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse . Then birds stuffed themselves on the dead bodies .
66020001	I saw an angel come down from heaven , carrying the key to the deep pit and a big chain .
66020002	He chained the dragon for 1,000 years . It is that old snake , who is also known as the devil and Satan .
66020003	Then the angel threw the dragon into the pit . He locked and sealed it , so 1,000 years would go by before the dragon could fool the nations again . But after that , it would have to be set free for a little while .
66020004	I saw thrones , and sitting on those thrones were the ones who had been given the right to judge . I also saw the souls of the people who had their heads cut off because they had told about Jesus and preached God's message . They were the same ones who had not worshiped the beast or the idol , and they had refused to let its mark be put on their foreheads or hands . They will come to life and rule with Christ for 1,000 years .
66020007	At the end of the 1,000 years , Satan will be set free .
66020008	He will fool the countries of Gog and Magog , which are at the far ends of the earth , and their people will follow him into battle . They will have as many followers as there are grains of sand along the beach ,
66020009	and they will march all the way across the earth . They will surround the camp of God's people and the city God loves . But fire will come down from heaven and destroy the whole army .
66020010	Then the devil who fooled them will be thrown into the lake of fire and burning sulfur . He will be there with the beast and the false prophet , and they will be in pain day and night forever and ever .
66020011	I saw a great white throne with someone sitting on it . Earth and heaven tried to run away , but there was no place for them to go .
66020012	I also saw all the dead people standing in front of that throne . Every one of them was there , no matter who they had once been . Several books were opened , and then the book of life was opened . The dead were judged by what those books said they had done .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead people who were in it , and death and its kingdom also gave up their dead . Then everyone was judged by what they had done .
66020014	Afterwards , death and its kingdom were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death .
66020015	Anyone whose name wasn't written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	I saw a new heaven and a new earth . The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared , and so had the sea .
66021002	Then I saw New Jerusalem , the holy city , coming down from God in heaven . It was like a bride dressed in her wedding gown and ready to meet her husband .
66021003	I heard a loud voice shout from the throne :
66021005	Then the one sitting on the throne said :
66021009	I saw one of the seven angels who had the bowls filled with the seven last terrible troubles . The angel came to me and said , “ Come on ! I will show you the one who will be the bride and wife of the Lamb . ”
66021010	Then with the help of the Spirit , he took me to the top of a very high mountain . There he showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down from God in heaven .
66021011	The glory of God made the city bright . It was dazzling and crystal clear like a precious jasper stone .
66021012	The city had a high and thick wall with twelve gates , and each one of them was guarded by an angel . On each of the gates was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
66021013	Three of these gates were on the east , three were on the north , three more were on the south , and the other three were on the west .
66021014	The city was built on twelve foundation stones . On each of the stones was written the name of one of the Lamb's twelve apostles .
66021015	The angel who spoke to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city and its gates and its walls .
66021016	The city was shaped like a cube , because it was just as high as it was wide . When the angel measured the city , it was about 2,400 kilometers high and 2,400 kilometers wide .
66021017	Then the angel measured the wall , and by our measurements it was about 60 meters high .
66021018	The wall was built of jasper , and the city was made of pure gold , clear as crystal .
66021019	Each of the twelve foundations was a precious stone . The first was jasper , the second was sapphire , the third was agate , the fourth was emerald ,
66021020	the fifth was onyx , the sixth was carnelian , the seventh was chrysolite , the eighth was beryl , the ninth was topaz , the tenth was chrysoprase , the eleventh was jacinth , and the twelfth was amethyst .
66021021	Each of the twelve gates was a solid pearl . The streets of the city were made of pure gold , clear as crystal .
66021022	I did not see a temple there . The Lord God All-Powerful and the Lamb were its temple .
66021023	And the city did not need the sun or the moon . The glory of God was shining on it , and the Lamb was its light .
66021024	Nations will walk by the light of that city , and kings will bring their riches there .
66021025	Its gates are always open during the day , and night never comes .
66021026	The glorious treasures of nations will be brought into the city .
66021027	But nothing unworthy will be allowed to enter . No one who is dirty-minded or who tells lies will be there . Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life will be in the city .
66022001	The angel showed me a river that was crystal clear , and its waters gave life . The river came from the throne where God and the Lamb were seated .
66022002	Then it flowed down the middle of the city's main street . On each side of the river are trees that grow a different kind of fruit each month of the year . The fruit gives life , and the leaves are used as medicine to heal the nations .
66022003	God's curse will no longer be on the people of that city . He and the Lamb will be seated there on their thrones , and its people will worship God
66022004	and will see him face to face . God's name will be written on the foreheads of the people .
66022005	Never again will night appear , and no one who lives there will ever need a lamp or the sun . The Lord God will be their light , and they will rule forever .
66022006	Then I was told :
66022008	My name is John , and I am the one who heard and saw these things . Then after I had heard and seen all this , I knelt down and began to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown it to me .
66022009	But the angel said ,
66022012	Then I was told :
66022017	The Spirit and the bride say , “ Come ! ” Everyone who hears this should say , “ Come ! ” If you are thirsty , come ! If you want life-giving water , come and take it . It's free !
66022018	Here is my warning for everyone who hears the prophecies in this book :
66022020	The one who has spoken these things says , “ I am coming soon ! ” So , Lord Jesus , please come soon !
66022021	I pray that the Lord Jesus will be kind to all of you .
