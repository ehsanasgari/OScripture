40001001	This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David , the son of Abraham :
40001002	Abraham was the father of Isaac , Isaac the father of Jacob , Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers ,
40001003	Judah the father of Perez and Zerah , whose mother was Tamar , Perez the father of Hezron , Hezron the father of Ram ,
40001004	Ram the father of Amminadab , Amminadab the father of Nahshon , Nahshon the father of Salmon ,
40001005	Salmon the father of Boaz , whose mother was Rahab , Boaz the father of Obed , whose mother was Ruth , Obed the father of Jesse ,
40001006	and Jesse the father of King David . David was the father of Solomon , whose mother had been Uriah's wife ,
40001007	Solomon the father of Rehoboam , Rehoboam the father of Abijah , Abijah the father of Asa ,
40001008	Asa the father of Jehoshaphat , Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram , Jehoram the father of Uzziah ,
40001009	Uzziah the father of Jotham , Jotham the father of Ahaz , Ahaz the father of Hezekiah ,
40001010	Hezekiah the father of Manasseh , Manasseh the father of Amon , Amon the father of Josiah ,
40001011	and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon .
40001012	After the exile to Babylon : Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel , Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel ,
40001013	Zerubbabel the father of Abihud , Abihud the father of Eliakim , Eliakim the father of Azor ,
40001014	Azor the father of Zadok , Zadok the father of Akim , Akim the father of Elihud ,
40001015	Elihud the father of Eleazar , Eleazar the father of Matthan , Matthan the father of Jacob ,
40001016	and Jacob the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , and Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah .
40001017	Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David , fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon , and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah .
40001018	This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about : His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph , but before they came together , she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit .
40001019	Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law , and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace , he had in mind to divorce her quietly .
40001020	But after he had considered this , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , " Joseph son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife , because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit .
40001021	She will give birth to a son , and you are to give him the name Jesus , because he will save his people from their sins . "
40001022	All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet :
40001023	" The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son , and they will call him Immanuel " ( which means " God with us " ) .
40001024	When Joseph woke up , he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife .
40001025	But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son . And he gave him the name Jesus .
40002001	After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea , during the time of King Herod , Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
40002002	and asked , " Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews ? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him . "
40002003	When King Herod heard this he was disturbed , and all Jerusalem with him .
40002004	When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law , he asked them where the Messiah was to be born .
40002005	" In Bethlehem in Judea , " they replied , " for this is what the prophet has written :
40002006	" ' But you , Bethlehem , in the land of Judah ,
40002007	Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared .
40002008	He sent them to Bethlehem and said , " Go and search carefully for the child . As soon as you find him , report to me , so that I too may go and worship him . "
40002009	After they had heard the king , they went on their way , and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was .
40002010	When they saw the star , they were overjoyed .
40002011	On coming to the house , they saw the child with his mother Mary , and they bowed down and worshiped him . Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh .
40002012	And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod , they returned to their country by another route .
40002013	When they had gone , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream . " Get up , " he said , " take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt . Stay there until I tell you , for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him . "
40002014	So he got up , took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt ,
40002015	where he stayed until the death of Herod . And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet : " Out of Egypt I called my son . "
40002016	When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi , he was furious , and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under , in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi .
40002017	Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled :
40002018	" A voice is heard in Ramah ,
40002019	After Herod died , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40002020	and said , " Get up , take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel , for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead . "
40002021	So he got up , took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel .
40002022	But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . Having been warned in a dream , he withdrew to the district of Galilee ,
40002023	and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth . So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets , that he would be called a Nazarene .
40003001	In those days John the Baptist came , preaching in the wilderness of Judea
40003002	and saying , " Repent , for the kingdom of heaven has come near . "
40003003	This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah :
40003005	People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan .
40003006	Confessing their sins , they were baptized by him in the Jordan River .
40003007	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing , he said to them : " You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
40003008	Produce fruit in keeping with repentance .
40003009	And do not think you can say to yourselves , ' We have Abraham as our father . ' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham .
40003010	The ax is already at the root of the trees , and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .
40003011	" I baptize you with water for repentance . But after me comes one who is more powerful than I , whose sandals I am not worthy to carry . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
40003012	His winnowing fork is in his hand , and he will clear his threshing floor , gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire . "
40003013	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John .
40003014	But John tried to deter him , saying , " I need to be baptized by you , and do you come to me ? "
40003015	Jesus replied , " Let it be so now ; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness . " Then John consented .
40003016	As soon as Jesus was baptized , he went up out of the water . At that moment heaven was opened , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him .
40003017	And a voice from heaven said , " This is my Son , whom I love ; with him I am well pleased . "
40004001	Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
40004002	After fasting forty days and forty nights , he was hungry .
40004003	The tempter came to him and said , " If you are the Son of God , tell these stones to become bread . "
40004004	Jesus answered , " It is written : ' Man shall not live on bread alone , but on every word that comes from the mouth of God . ' "
40004005	Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple .
40004006	" If you are the Son of God , " he said , " throw yourself down . For it is written :
40004008	Again , the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor .
40004009	" All this I will give you , " he said , " if you will bow down and worship me . "
40004010	Jesus said to him , " Away from me , Satan ! For it is written : ' Worship the Lord your God , and serve him only . ' "
40004011	Then the devil left him , and angels came and attended him .
40004012	When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison , he withdrew to Galilee .
40004013	Leaving Nazareth , he went and lived in Capernaum , which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali —
40004014	to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah :
40004015	" Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali ,
40004016	the people living in darkness
40004017	From that time on Jesus began to preach , " Repent , for the kingdom of heaven has come near . "
40004018	As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew . They were casting a net into the lake , for they were fishermen .
40004019	" Come , follow me , " Jesus said , " and I will send you out to fish for people . "
40004020	At once they left their nets and followed him .
40004021	Going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James son of Zebedee and his brother John . They were in a boat with their father Zebedee , preparing their nets . Jesus called them ,
40004022	and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him .
40004023	Jesus went throughout Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the good news of the kingdom , and healing every disease and sickness among the people .
40004024	News about him spread all over Syria , and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases , those suffering severe pain , the demon-possessed , those having seizures , and the paralyzed ; and he healed them .
40004025	Large crowds from Galilee , the Decapolis , Jerusalem , Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him .
40005001	Now when Jesus saw the crowds , he went up on a mountainside and sat down . His disciples came to him ,
40005002	and he began to teach them . He said :
40005003	" Blessed are the poor in spirit ,
40005004	Blessed are those who mourn ,
40005005	Blessed are the meek ,
40005006	Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness ,
40005007	Blessed are the merciful ,
40005008	Blessed are the pure in heart ,
40005009	Blessed are the peacemakers ,
40005010	Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness ,
40005011	" Blessed are you when people insult you , persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me .
40005012	Rejoice and be glad , because great is your reward in heaven , for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
40005013	" You are the salt of the earth . But if the salt loses its saltiness , how can it be made salty again ? It is no longer good for anything , except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot .
40005014	" You are the light of the world . A town built on a hill cannot be hidden .
40005015	Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl . Instead they put it on its stand , and it gives light to everyone in the house .
40005016	In the same way , let your light shine before others , that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven .
40005017	" Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets ; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them .
40005018	For truly I tell you , until heaven and earth disappear , not the smallest letter , not the least stroke of a pen , will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished .
40005019	Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven , but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
40005020	For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law , you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven .
40005021	" You have heard that it was said to the people long ago , ' You shall not murder , and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment . '
40005022	But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment . Again , anyone who says to a brother or sister , ' Raca , ' is answerable to the court . And anyone who says , ' You fool ! ' will be in danger of the fire of hell .
40005023	" Therefore , if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you ,
40005024	leave your gift there in front of the altar . First go and be reconciled to them ; then come and offer your gift .
40005025	" Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court . Do it while you are still together on the way , or your adversary may hand you over to the judge , and the judge may hand you over to the officer , and you may be thrown into prison .
40005026	Truly I tell you , you will not get out until you have paid the last penny .
40005027	" You have heard that it was said , ' You shall not commit adultery . '
40005028	But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
40005029	If your right eye causes you to stumble , gouge it out and throw it away . It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell .
40005030	And if your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell .
40005031	" It has been said , ' Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce . '
40005032	But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , makes her the victim of adultery , and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
40005033	" Again , you have heard that it was said to the people long ago , ' Do not break your oath , but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made . '
40005034	But I tell you , do not swear an oath at all : either by heaven , for it is God's throne ;
40005035	or by the earth , for it is his footstool ; or by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the Great King .
40005036	And do not swear by your head , for you cannot make even one hair white or black .
40005037	All you need to say is simply ' Yes ' or ' No ' ; anything beyond this comes from the evil one .
40005038	" You have heard that it was said , ' Eye for eye , and tooth for tooth . '
40005039	But I tell you , do not resist an evil person . If anyone slaps you on the right cheek , turn to them the other cheek also .
40005040	And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt , hand over your coat as well .
40005041	If anyone forces you to go one mile , go with them two miles .
40005042	Give to the one who asks you , and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you .
40005043	" You have heard that it was said , ' Love your neighbor and hate your enemy . '
40005044	But I tell you , love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you ,
40005045	that you may be children of your Father in heaven . He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous .
40005046	If you love those who love you , what reward will you get ? Are not even the tax collectors doing that ?
40005047	And if you greet only your own people , what are you doing more than others ? Do not even pagans do that ?
40005048	Be perfect , therefore , as your heavenly Father is perfect .
40006001	" Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them . If you do , you will have no reward from your Father in heaven .
40006002	" So when you give to the needy , do not announce it with trumpets , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets , to be honored by others . Truly I tell you , they have received their reward in full .
40006003	But when you give to the needy , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
40006004	so that your giving may be in secret . Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you .
40006005	" And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others . Truly I tell you , they have received their reward in full .
40006006	But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you .
40006007	And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words .
40006008	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
40006009	" This , then , is how you should pray :
40006010	your kingdom come ,
40006011	Give us today our daily bread .
40006012	And forgive us our debts ,
40006013	And lead us not into temptation ,
40006014	For if you forgive other people when they sin against you , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
40006015	But if you do not forgive others their sins , your Father will not forgive your sins .
40006016	" When you fast , do not look somber as the hypocrites do , for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting . Truly I tell you , they have received their reward in full .
40006017	But when you fast , put oil on your head and wash your face ,
40006018	so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting , but only to your Father , who is unseen ; and your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you .
40006019	" Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moths and vermin destroy , and where thieves break in and steal .
40006020	But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where moths and vermin do not destroy , and where thieves do not break in and steal .
40006021	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
40006022	" The eye is the lamp of the body . If your eyes are healthy , your whole body will be full of light .
40006023	But if your eyes are unhealthy , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the light within you is darkness , how great is that darkness !
40006024	" No one can serve two masters . Either you will hate the one and love the other , or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other . You cannot serve both God and money .
40006025	" Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life , what you will eat or drink ; or about your body , what you will wear . Is not life more than food , and the body more than clothes ?
40006026	Look at the birds of the air ; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not much more valuable than they ?
40006027	Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life ?
40006028	" And why do you worry about clothes ? See how the flowers of the field grow . They do not labor or spin .
40006029	Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these .
40006030	If that is how God clothes the grass of the field , which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire , will he not much more clothe you — you of little faith ?
40006031	So do not worry , saying , ' What shall we eat ? ' or ' What shall we drink ? ' or ' What shall we wear ? '
40006032	For the pagans run after all these things , and your heavenly Father knows that you need them .
40006033	But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well .
40006034	Therefore do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will worry about itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own .
40007001	" Do not judge , or you too will be judged .
40007002	For in the same way you judge others , you will be judged , and with the measure you use , it will be measured to you .
40007003	" Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye ?
40007004	How can you say to your brother , ' Let me take the speck out of your eye , ' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye ?
40007005	You hypocrite , first take the plank out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye .
40007006	" Do not give dogs what is sacred ; do not throw your pearls to pigs . If you do , they may trample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
40007007	" Ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be opened to you .
40007008	For everyone who asks receives ; the one who seeks finds ; and to the one who knocks , the door will be opened .
40007009	" Which of you , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ?
40007010	Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a snake ?
40007011	If you , then , though you are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him !
40007012	So in everything , do to others what you would have them do to you , for this sums up the Law and the Prophets .
40007013	" Enter through the narrow gate . For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction , and many enter through it .
40007014	But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life , and only a few find it .
40007015	" Watch out for false prophets . They come to you in sheep's clothing , but inwardly they are ferocious wolves .
40007016	By their fruit you will recognize them . Do people pick grapes from thornbushes , or figs from thistles ?
40007017	Likewise , every good tree bears good fruit , but a bad tree bears bad fruit .
40007018	A good tree cannot bear bad fruit , and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit .
40007019	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
40007020	Thus , by their fruit you will recognize them .
40007021	" Not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
40007022	Many will say to me on that day , ' Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles ? '
40007023	Then I will tell them plainly , ' I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers ! '
40007024	" Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock .
40007025	The rain came down , the streams rose , and the winds blew and beat against that house ; yet it did not fall , because it had its foundation on the rock .
40007026	But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand .
40007027	The rain came down , the streams rose , and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell with a great crash . "
40007028	When Jesus had finished saying these things , the crowds were amazed at his teaching ,
40007029	because he taught as one who had authority , and not as their teachers of the law .
40008001	When Jesus came down from the mountainside , large crowds followed him .
40008002	A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said , " Lord , if you are willing , you can make me clean . "
40008003	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man . " I am willing , " he said . " Be clean ! " Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy .
40008004	Then Jesus said to him , " See that you don't tell anyone . But go , show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . "
40008005	When Jesus had entered Capernaum , a centurion came to him , asking for help .
40008006	" Lord , " he said , " my servant lies at home paralyzed , suffering terribly . "
40008007	Jesus said to him , " Shall I come and heal him ? "
40008008	The centurion replied , " Lord , I do not deserve to have you come under my roof . But just say the word , and my servant will be healed .
40008009	For I myself am a man under authority , with soldiers under me . I tell this one , ' Go , ' and he goes ; and that one , ' Come , ' and he comes . I say to my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
40008010	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed and said to those following him , " Truly I tell you , I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith .
40008011	I say to you that many will come from the east and the west , and will take their places at the feast with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .
40008012	But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside , into the darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . "
40008013	Then Jesus said to the centurion , " Go ! Let it be done just as you believed it would . " And his servant was healed at that moment .
40008014	When Jesus came into Peter's house , he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever .
40008015	He touched her hand and the fever left her , and she got up and began to wait on him .
40008016	When evening came , many who were demon-possessed were brought to him , and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick .
40008017	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah :
40008021	Another disciple said to him , " Lord , first let me go and bury my father . "
40008022	But Jesus told him , " Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead . "
40008023	Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him .
40008024	Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake , so that the waves swept over the boat . But Jesus was sleeping .
40008025	The disciples went and woke him , saying , " Lord , save us ! We're going to drown ! "
40008026	He replied , " You of little faith , why are you so afraid ? " Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves , and it was completely calm .
40008027	The men were amazed and asked , " What kind of man is this ? Even the winds and the waves obey him ! "
40008028	When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes , two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him . They were so violent that no one could pass that way .
40008029	" What do you want with us , Son of God ? " they shouted . " Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time ? "
40008030	Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding .
40008031	The demons begged Jesus , " If you drive us out , send us into the herd of pigs . "
40008032	He said to them , " Go ! " So they came out and went into the pigs , and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water .
40008033	Those tending the pigs ran off , went into the town and reported all this , including what had happened to the demon-possessed men .
40008034	Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus . And when they saw him , they pleaded with him to leave their region .
40009001	Jesus stepped into a boat , crossed over and came to his own town .
40009002	Some men brought to him a paralyzed man , lying on a mat . When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the man , " Take heart , son ; your sins are forgiven . "
40009003	At this , some of the teachers of the law said to themselves , " This fellow is blaspheming ! "
40009004	Knowing their thoughts , Jesus said , " Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts ?
40009005	Which is easier : to say , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Get up and walk ' ?
40009006	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . " So he said to the paralyzed man , " Get up , take your mat and go home . "
40009007	Then the man got up and went home .
40009008	When the crowd saw this , they were filled with awe ; and they praised God , who had given such authority to man .
40009009	As Jesus went on from there , he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth . " Follow me , " he told him , and Matthew got up and followed him .
40009010	While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house , many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples .
40009011	When the Pharisees saw this , they asked his disciples , " Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? "
40009012	On hearing this , Jesus said , " It is not the healthy who need a doctor , but the sick .
40009013	But go and learn what this means : ' I desire mercy , not sacrifice . ' For I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners . "
40009014	Then John's disciples came and asked him , " How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often , but your disciples do not fast ? "
40009015	Jesus answered , " How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them ? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them ; then they will fast .
40009016	" No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment , for the patch will pull away from the garment , making the tear worse .
40009017	Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins . If they do , the skins will burst ; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined . No , they pour new wine into new wineskins , and both are preserved . "
40009018	While he was saying this , a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said , " My daughter has just died . But come and put your hand on her , and she will live . "
40009019	Jesus got up and went with him , and so did his disciples .
40009020	Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak .
40009021	She said to herself , " If I only touch his cloak , I will be healed . "
40009022	Jesus turned and saw her . " Take heart , daughter , " he said , " your faith has healed you . " And the woman was healed at that moment .
40009023	When Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes ,
40009024	he said , " Go away . The girl is not dead but asleep . " But they laughed at him .
40009025	After the crowd had been put outside , he went in and took the girl by the hand , and she got up .
40009026	News of this spread through all that region .
40009027	As Jesus went on from there , two blind men followed him , calling out , " Have mercy on us , Son of David ! "
40009028	When he had gone indoors , the blind men came to him , and he asked them , " Do you believe that I am able to do this ? " " Yes , Lord , " they replied .
40009029	Then he touched their eyes and said , " According to your faith let it be done to you " ;
40009030	and their sight was restored . Jesus warned them sternly , " See that no one knows about this . "
40009031	But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region .
40009032	While they were going out , a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus .
40009033	And when the demon was driven out , the man who had been mute spoke . The crowd was amazed and said , " Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel . "
40009034	But the Pharisees said , " It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons . "
40009035	Jesus went through all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness .
40009036	When he saw the crowds , he had compassion on them , because they were harassed and helpless , like sheep without a shepherd .
40009037	Then he said to his disciples , " The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few .
40009038	Ask the Lord of the harvest , therefore , to send out workers into his harvest field . "
40010001	Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness .
40010002	These are the names of the twelve apostles : first , Simon ( who is called Peter ) and his brother Andrew ; James son of Zebedee , and his brother John ;
40010003	Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ;
40010004	Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
40010005	These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions : " Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans .
40010006	Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel .
40010007	As you go , proclaim this message : ' The kingdom of heaven has come near . '
40010008	Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse those who have leprosy , drive out demons . Freely you have received ; freely give .
40010009	" Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts —
40010010	no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff , for the worker is worth his keep .
40010011	Whatever town or village you enter , search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave .
40010012	As you enter the home , give it your greeting .
40010013	If the home is deserving , let your peace rest on it ; if it is not , let your peace return to you .
40010014	If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words , leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet .
40010015	Truly I tell you , it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town .
40010016	" I am sending you out like sheep among wolves . Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves .
40010017	Be on your guard ; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues .
40010018	On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles .
40010019	But when they arrest you , do not worry about what to say or how to say it . At that time you will be given what to say ,
40010020	for it will not be you speaking , but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
40010021	" Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child ; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death .
40010022	You will be hated by everyone because of me , but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved .
40010023	When you are persecuted in one place , flee to another . Truly I tell you , you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes .
40010024	" The student is not above the teacher , nor a servant above his master .
40010025	It is enough for students to be like their teachers , and servants like their masters . If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul , how much more the members of his household !
40010026	" So do not be afraid of them , for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed , or hidden that will not be made known .
40010027	What I tell you in the dark , speak in the daylight ; what is whispered in your ear , proclaim from the roofs .
40010028	Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . Rather , be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell .
40010029	Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care .
40010030	And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
40010031	So don't be afraid ; you are worth more than many sparrows .
40010032	" Whoever acknowledges me before others , I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven .
40010033	But whoever disowns me before others , I will disown before my Father in heaven .
40010034	" Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth . I did not come to bring peace , but a sword .
40010035	For I have come to turn
40010037	" Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
40010038	Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me .
40010039	Whoever finds their life will lose it , and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it .
40010040	" Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me , and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me .
40010041	Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward , and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward .
40010042	And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple , truly I tell you , that person will certainly not lose their reward . "
40011001	After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples , he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee .
40011002	When John , who was in prison , heard about the deeds of the Messiah , he sent his disciples
40011003	to ask him , " Are you the one who is to come , or should we expect someone else ? "
40011004	Jesus replied , " Go back and report to John what you hear and see :
40011005	The blind receive sight , the lame walk , those who have leprosy are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , and the good news is proclaimed to the poor .
40011006	Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me . "
40011007	As John's disciples were leaving , Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John : " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed swayed by the wind ?
40011008	If not , what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in fine clothes ? No , those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces .
40011009	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet .
40011010	This is the one about whom it is written :
40011012	From the days of John the Baptist until now , the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence , and violent people have been raiding it .
40011013	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John .
40011014	And if you are willing to accept it , he is the Elijah who was to come .
40011015	Whoever has ears , let them hear .
40011016	" To what can I compare this generation ? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others :
40011017	" ' We played the pipe for you ,
40011018	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ' He has a demon . '
40011019	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ' Here is a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners . ' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds . "
40011020	Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed , because they did not repent .
40011021	" Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
40011022	But I tell you , it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
40011023	And you , Capernaum , will you be lifted to the heavens ? No , you will go down to Hades . For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom , it would have remained to this day .
40011024	But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you . "
40011025	At that time Jesus said , " I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned , and revealed them to little children .
40011026	Yes , Father , for this is what you were pleased to do .
40011027	" All things have been committed to me by my Father . No one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him .
40011028	" Come to me , all you who are weary and burdened , and I will give you rest .
40011029	Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
40011030	For my yoke is easy and my burden is light . "
40012001	At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath . His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them .
40012002	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to him , " Look ! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath . "
40012003	He answered , " Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
40012004	He entered the house of God , and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread — which was not lawful for them to do , but only for the priests .
40012005	Or haven't you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent ?
40012006	I tell you that something greater than the temple is here .
40012007	If you had known what these words mean , ' I desire mercy , not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the innocent .
40012008	For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath . "
40012009	Going on from that place , he went into their synagogue ,
40012010	and a man with a shriveled hand was there . Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus , they asked him , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? "
40012011	He said to them , " If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath , will you not take hold of it and lift it out ?
40012012	How much more valuable is a person than a sheep ! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath . "
40012013	Then he said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " So he stretched it out and it was completely restored , just as sound as the other .
40012014	But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus .
40012015	Aware of this , Jesus withdrew from that place . A large crowd followed him , and he healed all who were ill .
40012016	He warned them not to tell others about him .
40012017	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah :
40012018	" Here is my servant whom I have chosen ,
40012019	He will not quarrel or cry out ;
40012020	A bruised reed he will not break ,
40012021	In his name the nations will put their hope . "
40012022	Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute , and Jesus healed him , so that he could both talk and see .
40012023	All the people were astonished and said , " Could this be the Son of David ? "
40012024	But when the Pharisees heard this , they said , " It is only by Beelzebul , the prince of demons , that this fellow drives out demons . "
40012025	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined , and every city or household divided against itself will not stand .
40012026	If Satan drives out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then can his kingdom stand ?
40012027	And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your people drive them out ? So then , they will be your judges .
40012028	But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
40012029	" Or again , how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then he can plunder his house .
40012030	" Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
40012031	And so I tell you , every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven , but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
40012032	Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , either in this age or in the age to come .
40012033	" Make a tree good and its fruit will be good , or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad , for a tree is recognized by its fruit .
40012034	You brood of vipers , how can you who are evil say anything good ? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of .
40012035	A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him , and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him .
40012036	But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken .
40012037	For by your words you will be acquitted , and by your words you will be condemned . "
40012038	Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him , " Teacher , we want to see a sign from you . "
40012039	He answered , " A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign ! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
40012040	For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish , so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
40012041	The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and now something greater than Jonah is here .
40012042	The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom , and now something greater than Solomon is here .
40012043	" When an impure spirit comes out of a person , it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it .
40012044	Then it says , ' I will return to the house I left . ' When it arrives , it finds the house unoccupied , swept clean and put in order .
40012045	Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they go in and live there . And the final condition of that person is worse than the first . That is how it will be with this wicked generation . "
40012046	While Jesus was still talking to the crowd , his mother and brothers stood outside , wanting to speak to him .
40012047	Someone told him , " Your mother and brothers are standing outside , wanting to speak to you . "
40012048	He replied to him , " Who is my mother , and who are my brothers ? "
40012049	Pointing to his disciples , he said , " Here are my mother and my brothers .
40012050	For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother . "
40013001	That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake .
40013002	Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it , while all the people stood on the shore .
40013003	Then he told them many things in parables , saying : " A farmer went out to sow his seed .
40013004	As he was scattering the seed , some fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
40013005	Some fell on rocky places , where it did not have much soil . It sprang up quickly , because the soil was shallow .
40013006	But when the sun came up , the plants were scorched , and they withered because they had no root .
40013007	Other seed fell among thorns , which grew up and choked the plants .
40013008	Still other seed fell on good soil , where it produced a crop — a hundred , sixty or thirty times what was sown .
40013009	Whoever has ears , let them hear . "
40013010	The disciples came to him and asked , " Why do you speak to the people in parables ? "
40013011	He replied , " Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you , but not to them .
40013012	Whoever has will be given more , and they will have an abundance . Whoever does not have , even what they have will be taken from them .
40013013	This is why I speak to them in parables :
40013015	For this people's heart has become calloused ;
40013016	But blessed are your eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear .
40013017	For truly I tell you , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it , and to hear what you hear but did not hear it .
40013018	" Listen then to what the parable of the sower means :
40013019	When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it , the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart . This is the seed sown along the path .
40013020	The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy .
40013021	But since they have no root , they last only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the word , they quickly fall away .
40013022	The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word , but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word , making it unfruitful .
40013023	But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it . This is the one who produces a crop , yielding a hundred , sixty or thirty times what was sown . "
40013024	Jesus told them another parable : " The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
40013025	But while everyone was sleeping , his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat , and went away .
40013026	When the wheat sprouted and formed heads , then the weeds also appeared .
40013027	" The owner's servants came to him and said , ' Sir , didn't you sow good seed in your field ? Where then did the weeds come from ? '
40013028	" ' An enemy did this , ' he replied . " The servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and pull them up ? '
40013029	" ' No , ' he answered , ' because while you are pulling the weeds , you may uproot the wheat with them .
40013030	Let both grow together until the harvest . At that time I will tell the harvesters : First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned ; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn . ' "
40013031	He told them another parable : " The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed , which a man took and planted in his field .
40013032	Though it is the smallest of all seeds , yet when it grows , it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree , so that the birds come and perch in its branches . "
40013033	He told them still another parable : " The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough . "
40013034	Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables ; he did not say anything to them without using a parable .
40013035	So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet :
40013038	The field is the world , and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom . The weeds are the people of the evil one ,
40013039	and the enemy who sows them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the age , and the harvesters are angels .
40013040	" As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire , so it will be at the end of the age .
40013041	The Son of Man will send out his angels , and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil .
40013042	They will throw them into the blazing furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013043	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Whoever has ears , let them hear .
40013044	" The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field . When a man found it , he hid it again , and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field .
40013045	" Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls .
40013046	When he found one of great value , he went away and sold everything he had and bought it .
40013047	" Once again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish .
40013048	When it was full , the fishermen pulled it up on the shore . Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets , but threw the bad away .
40013049	This is how it will be at the end of the age . The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
40013050	and throw them into the blazing furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40013051	" Have you understood all these things ? " Jesus asked . " Yes , " they replied .
40013052	He said to them , " Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old . "
40013053	When Jesus had finished these parables , he moved on from there .
40013054	Coming to his hometown , he began teaching the people in their synagogue , and they were amazed . " Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers ? " they asked .
40013055	" Isn't this the carpenter's son ? Isn't his mother's name Mary , and aren't his brothers James , Joseph , Simon and Judas ?
40013056	Aren't all his sisters with us ? Where then did this man get all these things ? "
40013057	And they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home . "
40013058	And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith .
40014001	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus ,
40014002	and he said to his attendants , " This is John the Baptist ; he has risen from the dead ! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him . "
40014003	Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife ,
40014004	for John had been saying to him : " It is not lawful for you to have her . "
40014005	Herod wanted to kill John , but he was afraid of the people , because they considered John a prophet .
40014006	On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much
40014007	that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
40014008	Prompted by her mother , she said , " Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist . "
40014009	The king was distressed , but because of his oaths and his dinner guests , he ordered that her request be granted
40014010	and had John beheaded in the prison .
40014011	His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl , who carried it to her mother .
40014012	John's disciples came and took his body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus .
40014013	When Jesus heard what had happened , he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place . Hearing of this , the crowds followed him on foot from the towns .
40014014	When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd , he had compassion on them and healed their sick .
40014015	As evening approached , the disciples came to him and said , " This is a remote place , and it's already getting late . Send the crowds away , so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food . "
40014016	Jesus replied , " They do not need to go away . You give them something to eat . "
40014017	" We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish , " they answered .
40014018	" Bring them here to me , " he said .
40014019	And he directed the people to sit down on the grass . Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke the loaves . Then he gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
40014020	They all ate and were satisfied , and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over .
40014021	The number of those who ate was about five thousand men , besides women and children .
40014022	Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side , while he dismissed the crowd .
40014023	After he had dismissed them , he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray . Later that night , he was there alone ,
40014024	and the boat was already a considerable distance from land , buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it .
40014025	Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them , walking on the lake .
40014026	When the disciples saw him walking on the lake , they were terrified . " It's a ghost , " they said , and cried out in fear .
40014027	But Jesus immediately said to them : " Take courage ! It is I . Don't be afraid . "
40014028	" Lord , if it's you , " Peter replied , " tell me to come to you on the water . "
40014029	" Come , " he said . Then Peter got down out of the boat , walked on the water and came toward Jesus .
40014030	But when he saw the wind , he was afraid and , beginning to sink , cried out , " Lord , save me ! "
40014031	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him . " You of little faith , " he said , " why did you doubt ? "
40014032	And when they climbed into the boat , the wind died down .
40014033	Then those who were in the boat worshiped him , saying , " Truly you are the Son of God . "
40014034	When they had crossed over , they landed at Gennesaret .
40014035	And when the men of that place recognized Jesus , they sent word to all the surrounding country . People brought all their sick to him
40014036	and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak , and all who touched it were healed .
40015001	Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked ,
40015002	" Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? They don't wash their hands before they eat ! "
40015003	Jesus replied , " And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition ?
40015004	For God said , ' Honor your father and mother ' and ' Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death . '
40015005	But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ' devoted to God , '
40015006	they are not to ' honor their father or mother ' with it . Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition .
40015007	You hypocrites ! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you :
40015008	" ' These people honor me with their lips ,
40015009	They worship me in vain ;
40015010	Jesus called the crowd to him and said , " Listen and understand .
40015011	What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them , but what comes out of their mouth , that is what defiles them . "
40015012	Then the disciples came to him and asked , " Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this ? "
40015013	He replied , " Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots .
40015014	Leave them ; they are blind guides . If the blind lead the blind , both will fall into a pit . "
40015015	Peter said , " Explain the parable to us . "
40015016	" Are you still so dull ? " Jesus asked them .
40015017	" Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body ?
40015018	But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart , and these defile them .
40015019	For out of the heart come evil thoughts — murder , adultery , sexual immorality , theft , false testimony , slander .
40015020	These are what defile a person ; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them . "
40015021	Leaving that place , Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
40015022	A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him , crying out , " Lord , Son of David , have mercy on me ! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly . "
40015023	Jesus did not answer a word . So his disciples came to him and urged him , " Send her away , for she keeps crying out after us . "
40015024	He answered , " I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel . "
40015025	The woman came and knelt before him . " Lord , help me ! " she said .
40015026	He replied , " It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs . "
40015027	" Yes it is , Lord , " she said . " Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table . "
40015028	Then Jesus said to her , " Woman , you have great faith ! Your request is granted . " And her daughter was healed at that moment .
40015029	Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee . Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down .
40015030	Great crowds came to him , bringing the lame , the blind , the crippled , the mute and many others , and laid them at his feet ; and he healed them .
40015031	The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking , the crippled made well , the lame walking and the blind seeing . And they praised the God of Israel .
40015032	Jesus called his disciples to him and said , " I have compassion for these people ; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat . I do not want to send them away hungry , or they may collapse on the way . "
40015033	His disciples answered , " Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd ? "
40015034	" How many loaves do you have ? " Jesus asked . " Seven , " they replied , " and a few small fish . "
40015035	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground .
40015036	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish , and when he had given thanks , he broke them and gave them to the disciples , and they in turn to the people .
40015037	They all ate and were satisfied . Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over .
40015038	The number of those who ate was four thousand men , besides women and children .
40015039	After Jesus had sent the crowd away , he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan .
40016001	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven .
40016002	He replied , " When evening comes , you say , ' It will be fair weather , for the sky is red , '
40016003	and in the morning , ' Today it will be stormy , for the sky is red and overcast . ' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky , but you cannot interpret the signs of the times .
40016004	A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign , but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah . " Jesus then left them and went away .
40016005	When they went across the lake , the disciples forgot to take bread .
40016006	" Be careful , " Jesus said to them . " Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016007	They discussed this among themselves and said , " It is because we didn't bring any bread . "
40016008	Aware of their discussion , Jesus asked , " You of little faith , why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread ?
40016009	Do you still not understand ? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many basketfuls you gathered ?
40016010	Or the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many basketfuls you gathered ?
40016011	How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread ? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . "
40016012	Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread , but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
40016013	When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , " Who do people say the Son of Man is ? "
40016014	They replied , " Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , Jeremiah or one of the prophets . "
40016015	" But what about you ? " he asked . " Who do you say I am ? "
40016016	Simon Peter answered , " You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God . "
40016017	Jesus replied , " Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah , for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood , but by my Father in heaven .
40016018	And I tell you that you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my church , and the gates of Hades will not overcome it .
40016019	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven . "
40016020	Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah .
40016021	From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders , the chief priests and the teachers of the law , and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life .
40016022	Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him . " Never , Lord ! " he said . " This shall never happen to you ! "
40016023	Jesus turned and said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ! You are a stumbling block to me ; you do not have in mind the concerns of God , but merely human concerns . "
40016024	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me .
40016025	For whoever wants to save their life will lose it , but whoever loses their life for me will find it .
40016026	What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world , yet forfeit their soul ? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul ?
40016027	For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels , and then he will reward each person according to what they have done .
40016028	" Truly I tell you , some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom . "
40017001	After six days Jesus took with him Peter , James and John the brother of James , and led them up a high mountain by themselves .
40017002	There he was transfigured before them . His face shone like the sun , and his clothes became as white as the light .
40017003	Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah , talking with Jesus .
40017004	Peter said to Jesus , " Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you wish , I will put up three shelters — one for you , one for Moses and one for Elijah . "
40017005	While he was still speaking , a bright cloud covered them , and a voice from the cloud said , " This is my Son , whom I love ; with him I am well pleased . Listen to him ! "
40017006	When the disciples heard this , they fell facedown to the ground , terrified .
40017007	But Jesus came and touched them . " Get up , " he said . " Don't be afraid . "
40017008	When they looked up , they saw no one except Jesus .
40017009	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus instructed them , " Don't tell anyone what you have seen , until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead . "
40017010	The disciples asked him , " Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? "
40017011	Jesus replied , " To be sure , Elijah comes and will restore all things .
40017012	But I tell you , Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him , but have done to him everything they wished . In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands . "
40017013	Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist .
40017014	When they came to the crowd , a man approached Jesus and knelt before him .
40017015	" Lord , have mercy on my son , " he said . " He has seizures and is suffering greatly . He often falls into the fire or into the water .
40017016	I brought him to your disciples , but they could not heal him . "
40017017	" You unbelieving and perverse generation , " Jesus replied , " how long shall I stay with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me . "
40017018	Jesus rebuked the demon , and it came out of the boy , and he was healed at that moment .
40017019	Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked , " Why couldn't we drive it out ? "
40017020	He replied , " Because you have so little faith . Truly I tell you , if you have faith as small as a mustard seed , you can say to this mountain , ' Move from here to there , ' and it will move . Nothing will be impossible for you . "
40017022	When they came together in Galilee , he said to them , " The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men .
40017023	They will kill him , and on the third day he will be raised to life . " And the disciples were filled with grief .
40017024	After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum , the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked , " Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax ? "
40017025	" Yes , he does , " he replied . When Peter came into the house , Jesus was the first to speak . " What do you think , Simon ? " he asked . " From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes — from their own children or from others ? "
40017026	" From others , " Peter answered . " Then the children are exempt , " Jesus said to him .
40017027	" But so that we may not cause offense , go to the lake and throw out your line . Take the first fish you catch ; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin . Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours . "
40018001	At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked , " Who , then , is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? "
40018002	He called a little child to him , and placed the child among them .
40018003	And he said : " Truly I tell you , unless you change and become like little children , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
40018004	Therefore , whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
40018005	And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me .
40018006	" If anyone causes one of these little ones — those who believe in me — to stumble , it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea .
40018007	Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble ! Such things must come , but woe to the person through whom they come !
40018008	If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire .
40018009	And if your eye causes you to stumble , gouge it out and throw it away . It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell .
40018010	" See that you do not despise one of these little ones . For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven .
40018012	" What do you think ? If a man owns a hundred sheep , and one of them wanders away , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off ?
40018013	And if he finds it , truly I tell you , he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off .
40018014	In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish .
40018015	" If your brother or sister sins , go and point out their fault , just between the two of you . If they listen to you , you have won them over .
40018016	But if they will not listen , take one or two others along , so that ' every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses . '
40018017	If they still refuse to listen , tell it to the church ; and if they refuse to listen even to the church , treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector .
40018018	" Truly I tell you , whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven .
40018019	" Again , truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
40018020	For where two or three gather in my name , there am I with them . "
40018021	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked , " Lord , how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me ? Up to seven times ? "
40018022	Jesus answered , " I tell you , not seven times , but seventy-seven times .
40018023	" Therefore , the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants .
40018024	As he began the settlement , a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him .
40018025	Since he was not able to pay , the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt .
40018026	" At this the servant fell on his knees before him . ' Be patient with me , ' he begged , ' and I will pay back everything . '
40018027	The servant's master took pity on him , canceled the debt and let him go .
40018028	" But when that servant went out , he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins . He grabbed him and began to choke him . ' Pay back what you owe me ! ' he demanded .
40018029	" His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him , ' Be patient with me , and I will pay it back . '
40018030	" But he refused . Instead , he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt .
40018031	When the other servants saw what had happened , they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened .
40018032	" Then the master called the servant in . ' You wicked servant , ' he said , ' I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to .
40018033	Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you ? '
40018034	In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured , until he should pay back all he owed .
40018035	" This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart . "
40019001	When Jesus had finished saying these things , he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan .
40019002	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
40019003	Some Pharisees came to him to test him . They asked , " Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason ? "
40019004	" Haven't you read , " he replied , " that at the beginning the Creator ' made them male and female , '
40019005	and said , ' For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and the two will become one flesh ' ?
40019006	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore what God has joined together , let no one separate . "
40019007	" Why then , " they asked , " did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away ? "
40019008	Jesus replied , " Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard . But it was not this way from the beginning .
40019009	I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another woman commits adultery . "
40019010	The disciples said to him , " If this is the situation between a husband and wife , it is better not to marry . "
40019011	Jesus replied , " Not everyone can accept this word , but only those to whom it has been given .
40019012	For there are eunuchs who were born that way , and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others — and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . The one who can accept this should accept it . "
40019013	Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them . But the disciples rebuked them .
40019014	Jesus said , " Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these . "
40019015	When he had placed his hands on them , he went on from there .
40019016	Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked , " Teacher , what good thing must I do to get eternal life ? "
40019017	" Why do you ask me about what is good ? " Jesus replied . " There is only One who is good . If you want to enter life , keep the commandments . "
40019018	" Which ones ? " he inquired . Jesus replied , " ' You shall not murder , you shall not commit adultery , you shall not steal , you shall not give false testimony ,
40019019	honor your father and mother , ' and ' love your neighbor as yourself . ' "
40019020	" All these I have kept , " the young man said . " What do I still lack ? "
40019021	Jesus answered , " If you want to be perfect , go , sell your possessions and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me . "
40019022	When the young man heard this , he went away sad , because he had great wealth .
40019023	Then Jesus said to his disciples , " Truly I tell you , it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven .
40019024	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God . "
40019025	When the disciples heard this , they were greatly astonished and asked , " Who then can be saved ? "
40019026	Jesus looked at them and said , " With man this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . "
40019027	Peter answered him , " We have left everything to follow you ! What then will there be for us ? "
40019028	Jesus said to them , " Truly I tell you , at the renewal of all things , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
40019029	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life .
40019030	But many who are first will be last , and many who are last will be first .
40020001	" For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard .
40020002	He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard .
40020003	" About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing .
40020004	He told them , ' You also go and work in my vineyard , and I will pay you whatever is right . '
40020005	So they went . " He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing .
40020006	About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around . He asked them , ' Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing ? '
40020007	" ' Because no one has hired us , ' they answered . " He said to them , ' You also go and work in my vineyard . '
40020008	" When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman , ' Call the workers and pay them their wages , beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first . '
40020009	" The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius .
40020010	So when those came who were hired first , they expected to receive more . But each one of them also received a denarius .
40020011	When they received it , they began to grumble against the landowner .
40020012	' These who were hired last worked only one hour , ' they said , ' and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day . '
40020013	" But he answered one of them , ' I am not being unfair to you , friend . Didn't you agree to work for a denarius ?
40020014	Take your pay and go . I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you .
40020015	Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money ? Or are you envious because I am generous ? '
40020016	" So the last will be first , and the first will be last . "
40020017	Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem . On the way , he took the Twelve aside and said to them ,
40020018	" We are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law . They will condemn him to death
40020019	and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified . On the third day he will be raised to life ! "
40020020	Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and , kneeling down , asked a favor of him .
40020021	" What is it you want ? " he asked . She said , " Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom . "
40020022	" You don't know what you are asking , " Jesus said to them . " Can you drink the cup I am going to drink ? " " We can , " they answered .
40020023	Jesus said to them , " You will indeed drink from my cup , but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant . These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father . "
40020024	When the ten heard about this , they were indignant with the two brothers .
40020025	Jesus called them together and said , " You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their high officials exercise authority over them .
40020026	Not so with you . Instead , whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ,
40020027	and whoever wants to be first must be your slave —
40020028	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
40020029	As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed him .
40020030	Two blind men were sitting by the roadside , and when they heard that Jesus was going by , they shouted , " Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! "
40020031	The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet , but they shouted all the louder , " Lord , Son of David , have mercy on us ! "
40020032	Jesus stopped and called them . " What do you want me to do for you ? " he asked .
40020033	" Lord , " they answered , " we want our sight . "
40020034	Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes . Immediately they received their sight and followed him .
40021001	As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two disciples ,
40021002	saying to them , " Go to the village ahead of you , and at once you will find a donkey tied there , with her colt by her . Untie them and bring them to me .
40021003	If anyone says anything to you , say that the Lord needs them , and he will send them right away . "
40021004	This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet :
40021005	" Say to Daughter Zion ,
40021006	The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them .
40021007	They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on .
40021008	A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road , while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
40021009	The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted ,
40021011	The crowds answered , " This is Jesus , the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee . "
40021012	Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there . He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves .
40021013	" It is written , " he said to them , " ' My house will be called a house of prayer , ' but you are making it ' a den of robbers . ' "
40021014	The blind and the lame came to him at the temple , and he healed them .
40021015	But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts , " Hosanna to the Son of David , " they were indignant .
40021016	" Do you hear what these children are saying ? " they asked him . " Yes , " replied Jesus , " have you never read ,
40021017	And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany , where he spent the night .
40021018	Early in the morning , as Jesus was on his way back to the city , he was hungry .
40021019	Seeing a fig tree by the road , he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves . Then he said to it , " May you never bear fruit again ! " Immediately the tree withered .
40021020	When the disciples saw this , they were amazed . " How did the fig tree wither so quickly ? " they asked .
40021021	Jesus replied , " Truly I tell you , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only can you do what was done to the fig tree , but also you can say to this mountain , ' Go , throw yourself into the sea , ' and it will be done .
40021022	If you believe , you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer . "
40021023	Jesus entered the temple courts , and , while he was teaching , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him . " By what authority are you doing these things ? " they asked . " And who gave you this authority ? "
40021024	Jesus replied , " I will also ask you one question . If you answer me , I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
40021025	John's baptism — where did it come from ? Was it from heaven , or of human origin ? " They discussed it among themselves and said , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask , ' Then why didn't you believe him ? '
40021026	But if we say , ' Of human origin' — we are afraid of the people , for they all hold that John was a prophet . "
40021027	So they answered Jesus , " We don't know . " Then he said , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
40021028	" What do you think ? There was a man who had two sons . He went to the first and said , ' Son , go and work today in the vineyard . '
40021029	" ' I will not , ' he answered , but later he changed his mind and went .
40021030	" Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing . He answered , ' I will , sir , ' but he did not go .
40021031	" Which of the two did what his father wanted ? " " The first , " they answered . Jesus said to them , " Truly I tell you , the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you .
40021032	For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness , and you did not believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did . And even after you saw this , you did not repent and believe him .
40021033	" Listen to another parable : There was a landowner who planted a vineyard . He put a wall around it , dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower . Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place .
40021034	When the harvest time approached , he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit .
40021035	" The tenants seized his servants ; they beat one , killed another , and stoned a third .
40021036	Then he sent other servants to them , more than the first time , and the tenants treated them the same way .
40021037	Last of all , he sent his son to them . ' They will respect my son , ' he said .
40021038	" But when the tenants saw the son , they said to each other , ' This is the heir . Come , let's kill him and take his inheritance . '
40021039	So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
40021040	" Therefore , when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those tenants ? "
40021041	" He will bring those wretches to a wretched end , " they replied , " and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants , who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time . "
40021042	Jesus said to them , " Have you never read in the Scriptures :
40021043	" Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit .
40021044	Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces ; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed . "
40021045	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables , they knew he was talking about them .
40021046	They looked for a way to arrest him , but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet .
40022001	Jesus spoke to them again in parables , saying :
40022002	" The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son .
40022003	He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come , but they refused to come .
40022004	" Then he sent some more servants and said , ' Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner : My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding banquet . '
40022005	" But they paid no attention and went off — one to his field , another to his business .
40022006	The rest seized his servants , mistreated them and killed them .
40022007	The king was enraged . He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city .
40022008	" Then he said to his servants , ' The wedding banquet is ready , but those I invited did not deserve to come .
40022009	So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find . '
40022010	So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find , the bad as well as the good , and the wedding hall was filled with guests .
40022011	" But when the king came in to see the guests , he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes .
40022012	He asked , ' How did you get in here without wedding clothes , friend ? ' The man was speechless .
40022013	" Then the king told the attendants , ' Tie him hand and foot , and throw him outside , into the darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . '
40022014	" For many are invited , but few are chosen . "
40022015	Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words .
40022016	They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians . " Teacher , " they said , " we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . You aren't swayed by others , because you pay no attention to who they are .
40022017	Tell us then , what is your opinion ? Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not ? "
40022018	But Jesus , knowing their evil intent , said , " You hypocrites , why are you trying to trap me ?
40022019	Show me the coin used for paying the tax . " They brought him a denarius ,
40022020	and he asked them , " Whose image is this ? And whose inscription ? "
40022021	" Caesar's , " they replied . Then he said to them , " So give back to Caesar what is Caesar's , and to God what is God's . "
40022022	When they heard this , they were amazed . So they left him and went away .
40022023	That same day the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him with a question .
40022024	" Teacher , " they said , " Moses told us that if a man dies without having children , his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him .
40022025	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first one married and died , and since he had no children , he left his wife to his brother .
40022026	The same thing happened to the second and third brother , right on down to the seventh .
40022027	Finally , the woman died .
40022028	Now then , at the resurrection , whose wife will she be of the seven , since all of them were married to her ? "
40022029	Jesus replied , " You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God .
40022030	At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage ; they will be like the angels in heaven .
40022031	But about the resurrection of the dead — have you not read what God said to you ,
40022032	' I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ' ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living . "
40022033	When the crowds heard this , they were astonished at his teaching .
40022034	Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees , the Pharisees got together .
40022035	One of them , an expert in the law , tested him with this question :
40022036	" Teacher , which is the greatest commandment in the Law ? "
40022037	Jesus replied : " ' Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind . '
40022038	This is the first and greatest commandment .
40022039	And the second is like it : ' Love your neighbor as yourself . '
40022040	All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments . "
40022041	While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
40022042	" What do you think about the Messiah ? Whose son is he ? " " The son of David , " they replied .
40022043	He said to them , " How is it then that David , speaking by the Spirit , calls him ' Lord ' ? For he says ,
40022044	" ' The Lord said to my Lord :
40022045	If then David calls him ' Lord , ' how can he be his son ? "
40022046	No one could say a word in reply , and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions .
40023001	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples :
40023002	" The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat .
40023003	So you must be careful to do everything they tell you . But do not do what they do , for they do not practice what they preach .
40023004	They tie up heavy , cumbersome loads and put them on other people's shoulders , but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them .
40023005	" Everything they do is done for people to see : They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long ;
40023006	they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues ;
40023007	they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ' Rabbi ' by others .
40023008	" But you are not to be called ' Rabbi , ' for you have one Teacher , and you are all brothers .
40023009	And do not call anyone on earth ' father , ' for you have one Father , and he is in heaven .
40023010	Nor are you to be called instructors , for you have one Instructor , the Messiah .
40023011	The greatest among you will be your servant .
40023012	For those who exalt themselves will be humbled , and those who humble themselves will be exalted .
40023013	" Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces . You yourselves do not enter , nor will you let those enter who are trying to .
40023015	" Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert , and when you have succeeded , you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are .
40023016	" Woe to you , blind guides ! You say , ' If anyone swears by the temple , it means nothing ; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that oath . '
40023017	You blind fools ! Which is greater : the gold , or the temple that makes the gold sacred ?
40023018	You also say , ' If anyone swears by the altar , it means nothing ; but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath . '
40023019	You blind men ! Which is greater : the gift , or the altar that makes the gift sacred ?
40023020	Therefore , anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it .
40023021	And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it .
40023022	And anyone who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it .
40023023	" Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You give a tenth of your spices — mint , dill and cumin . But you have neglected the more important matters of the law — justice , mercy and faithfulness . You should have practiced the latter , without neglecting the former .
40023024	You blind guides ! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel .
40023025	" Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You clean the outside of the cup and dish , but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence .
40023026	Blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and dish , and then the outside also will be clean .
40023027	" Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You are like whitewashed tombs , which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean .
40023028	In the same way , on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness .
40023029	" Woe to you , teachers of the law and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous .
40023030	And you say , ' If we had lived in the days of our ancestors , we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets . '
40023031	So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets .
40023032	Go ahead , then , and complete what your ancestors started !
40023033	" You snakes ! You brood of vipers ! How will you escape being condemned to hell ?
40023034	Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers . Some of them you will kill and crucify ; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town .
40023035	And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah , whom you murdered between the temple and the altar .
40023036	Truly I tell you , all this will come on this generation .
40023037	" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you , how often I have longed to gather your children together , as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , and you were not willing .
40023038	Look , your house is left to you desolate .
40023039	For I tell you , you will not see me again until you say , ' Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord . ' "
40024001	Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings .
40024002	" Do you see all these things ? " he asked . " Truly I tell you , not one stone here will be left on another ; every one will be thrown down . "
40024003	As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately . " Tell us , " they said , " when will this happen , and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age ? "
40024004	Jesus answered : " Watch out that no one deceives you .
40024005	For many will come in my name , claiming , ' I am the Messiah , ' and will deceive many .
40024006	You will hear of wars and rumors of wars , but see to it that you are not alarmed . Such things must happen , but the end is still to come .
40024007	Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be famines and earthquakes in various places .
40024008	All these are the beginning of birth pains .
40024009	" Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death , and you will be hated by all nations because of me .
40024010	At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other ,
40024011	and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people .
40024012	Because of the increase of wickedness , the love of most will grow cold ,
40024013	but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved .
40024014	And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations , and then the end will come .
40024015	" So when you see standing in the holy place ' the abomination that causes desolation , ' spoken of through the prophet Daniel — let the reader understand —
40024016	then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
40024017	Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house .
40024018	Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak .
40024019	How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers !
40024020	Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath .
40024021	For then there will be great distress , unequaled from the beginning of the world until now — and never to be equaled again .
40024022	" If those days had not been cut short , no one would survive , but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened .
40024023	At that time if anyone says to you , ' Look , here is the Messiah ! ' or , ' There he is ! ' do not believe it .
40024024	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
40024025	See , I have told you ahead of time .
40024026	" So if anyone tells you , ' There he is , out in the wilderness , ' do not go out ; or , ' Here he is , in the inner rooms , ' do not believe it .
40024027	For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
40024028	Wherever there is a carcass , there the vultures will gather .
40024029	" Immediately after the distress of those days
40024030	" Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven . And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven , with power and great glory .
40024031	And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call , and they will gather his elect from the four winds , from one end of the heavens to the other .
40024032	" Now learn this lesson from the fig tree : As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out , you know that summer is near .
40024033	Even so , when you see all these things , you know that it is near , right at the door .
40024034	Truly I tell you , this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened .
40024035	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
40024036	" But about that day or hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
40024037	As it was in the days of Noah , so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man .
40024038	For in the days before the flood , people were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , up to the day Noah entered the ark ;
40024039	and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away . That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man .
40024040	Two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and the other left .
40024041	Two women will be grinding with a hand mill ; one will be taken and the other left .
40024042	" Therefore keep watch , because you do not know on what day your Lord will come .
40024043	But understand this : If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming , he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into .
40024044	So you also must be ready , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him .
40024045	" Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time ?
40024046	It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns .
40024047	Truly I tell you , he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
40024048	But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself , ' My master is staying away a long time , '
40024049	and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards .
40024050	The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of .
40024051	He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
40025001	" At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom .
40025002	Five of them were foolish and five were wise .
40025003	The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them .
40025004	The wise ones , however , took oil in jars along with their lamps .
40025005	The bridegroom was a long time in coming , and they all became drowsy and fell asleep .
40025006	" At midnight the cry rang out : ' Here's the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him ! '
40025007	" Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps .
40025008	The foolish ones said to the wise , ' Give us some of your oil ; our lamps are going out . '
40025009	" ' No , ' they replied , ' there may not be enough for both us and you . Instead , go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves . '
40025010	" But while they were on their way to buy the oil , the bridegroom arrived . The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet . And the door was shut .
40025011	" Later the others also came . ' Lord , Lord , ' they said , ' open the door for us ! '
40025012	" But he replied , ' Truly I tell you , I don't know you . '
40025013	" Therefore keep watch , because you do not know the day or the hour .
40025014	" Again , it will be like a man going on a journey , who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them .
40025015	To one he gave five bags of gold , to another two bags , and to another one bag , each according to his ability . Then he went on his journey .
40025016	The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more .
40025017	So also , the one with two bags of gold gained two more .
40025018	But the man who had received one bag went off , dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money .
40025019	" After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them .
40025020	The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five . ' Master , ' he said , ' you entrusted me with five bags of gold . See , I have gained five more . '
40025021	" His master replied , ' Well done , good and faithful servant ! You have been faithful with a few things ; I will put you in charge of many things . Come and share your master's happiness ! '
40025022	" The man with two bags of gold also came . ' Master , ' he said , ' you entrusted me with two bags of gold ; see , I have gained two more . '
40025023	" His master replied , ' Well done , good and faithful servant ! You have been faithful with a few things ; I will put you in charge of many things . Come and share your master's happiness ! '
40025024	" Then the man who had received one bag of gold came . ' Master , ' he said , ' I knew that you are a hard man , harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed .
40025025	So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground . See , here is what belongs to you . '
40025026	" His master replied , ' You wicked , lazy servant ! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed ?
40025027	Well then , you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers , so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest .
40025028	" ' So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags .
40025029	For whoever has will be given more , and they will have an abundance . Whoever does not have , even what they have will be taken from them .
40025030	And throw that worthless servant outside , into the darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . '
40025031	" When the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , he will sit on his glorious throne .
40025032	All the nations will be gathered before him , and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
40025033	He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
40025034	" Then the King will say to those on his right , ' Come , you who are blessed by my Father ; take your inheritance , the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world .
40025035	For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , I was a stranger and you invited me in ,
40025036	I needed clothes and you clothed me , I was sick and you looked after me , I was in prison and you came to visit me . '
40025037	" Then the righteous will answer him , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you something to drink ?
40025038	When did we see you a stranger and invite you in , or needing clothes and clothe you ?
40025039	When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you ? '
40025040	" The King will reply , ' Truly I tell you , whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine , you did for me . '
40025041	" Then he will say to those on his left , ' Depart from me , you who are cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels .
40025042	For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat , I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink ,
40025043	I was a stranger and you did not invite me in , I needed clothes and you did not clothe me , I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me . '
40025044	" They also will answer , ' Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison , and did not help you ? '
40025045	" He will reply , ' Truly I tell you , whatever you did not do for one of the least of these , you did not do for me . '
40025046	" Then they will go away to eternal punishment , but the righteous to eternal life . "
40026001	When Jesus had finished saying all these things , he said to his disciples ,
40026002	" As you know , the Passover is two days away — and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified . "
40026003	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest , whose name was Caiaphas ,
40026004	and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him .
40026005	" But not during the festival , " they said , " or there may be a riot among the people . "
40026006	While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper ,
40026007	a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume , which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table .
40026008	When the disciples saw this , they were indignant . " Why this waste ? " they asked .
40026009	" This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor . "
40026010	Aware of this , Jesus said to them , " Why are you bothering this woman ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
40026011	The poor you will always have with you , but you will not always have me .
40026012	When she poured this perfume on my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
40026013	Truly I tell you , wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world , what she has done will also be told , in memory of her . "
40026014	Then one of the Twelve — the one called Judas Iscariot — went to the chief priests
40026015	and asked , " What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you ? " So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver .
40026016	From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over .
40026017	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , the disciples came to Jesus and asked , " Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover ? "
40026018	He replied , " Go into the city to a certain man and tell him , ' The Teacher says : My appointed time is near . I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house . ' "
40026019	So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover .
40026020	When evening came , Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve .
40026021	And while they were eating , he said , " Truly I tell you , one of you will betray me . "
40026022	They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other , " Surely you don't mean me , Lord ? "
40026023	Jesus replied , " The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me .
40026024	The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him . But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born . "
40026025	Then Judas , the one who would betray him , said , " Surely you don't mean me , Rabbi ? " Jesus answered , " You have said so . "
40026026	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it and gave it to his disciples , saying , " Take and eat ; this is my body . "
40026027	Then he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them , saying , " Drink from it , all of you .
40026028	This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
40026029	I tell you , I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom . "
40026030	When they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
40026031	Then Jesus told them , " This very night you will all fall away on account of me , for it is written :
40026033	Peter replied , " Even if all fall away on account of you , I never will . "
40026034	" Truly I tell you , " Jesus answered , " this very night , before the rooster crows , you will disown me three times . "
40026035	But Peter declared , " Even if I have to die with you , I will never disown you . " And all the other disciples said the same .
40026036	Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to them , " Sit here while I go over there and pray . "
40026037	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him , and he began to be sorrowful and troubled .
40026038	Then he said to them , " My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death . Stay here and keep watch with me . "
40026039	Going a little farther , he fell with his face to the ground and prayed , " My Father , if it is possible , may this cup be taken from me . Yet not as I will , but as you will . "
40026040	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . " Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour ? " he asked Peter .
40026041	" Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
40026042	He went away a second time and prayed , " My Father , if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it , may your will be done . "
40026043	When he came back , he again found them sleeping , because their eyes were heavy .
40026044	So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time , saying the same thing .
40026045	Then he returned to the disciples and said to them , " Are you still sleeping and resting ? Look , the hour has come , and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners .
40026046	Rise ! Let us go ! Here comes my betrayer ! "
40026047	While he was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , arrived . With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs , sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people .
40026048	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them : " The one I kiss is the man ; arrest him . "
40026049	Going at once to Jesus , Judas said , " Greetings , Rabbi ! " and kissed him .
40026050	Jesus replied , " Do what you came for , friend . " Then the men stepped forward , seized Jesus and arrested him .
40026051	With that , one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword , drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest , cutting off his ear .
40026052	" Put your sword back in its place , " Jesus said to him , " for all who draw the sword will die by the sword .
40026053	Do you think I cannot call on my Father , and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels ?
40026054	But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way ? "
40026055	In that hour Jesus said to the crowd , " Am I leading a rebellion , that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me ? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching , and you did not arrest me .
40026056	But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled . " Then all the disciples deserted him and fled .
40026057	Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest , where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled .
40026058	But Peter followed him at a distance , right up to the courtyard of the high priest . He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome .
40026059	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death .
40026060	But they did not find any , though many false witnesses came forward . Finally two came forward
40026061	and declared , " This fellow said , ' I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days . ' "
40026062	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus , " Are you not going to answer ? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you ? "
40026063	But Jesus remained silent . The high priest said to him , " I charge you under oath by the living God : Tell us if you are the Messiah , the Son of God . "
40026064	" You have said so , " Jesus replied . " But I say to all of you : From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven . "
40026065	Then the high priest tore his clothes and said , " He has spoken blasphemy ! Why do we need any more witnesses ? Look , now you have heard the blasphemy .
40026066	What do you think ? " " He is worthy of death , " they answered .
40026067	Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists . Others slapped him
40026068	and said , " Prophesy to us , Messiah . Who hit you ? "
40026069	Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard , and a servant girl came to him . " You also were with Jesus of Galilee , " she said .
40026070	But he denied it before them all . " I don't know what you're talking about , " he said .
40026071	Then he went out to the gateway , where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there , " This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth . "
40026072	He denied it again , with an oath : " I don't know the man ! "
40026073	After a little while , those standing there went up to Peter and said , " Surely you are one of them ; your accent gives you away . "
40026074	Then he began to call down curses , and he swore to them , " I don't know the man ! " Immediately a rooster crowed .
40026075	Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken : " Before the rooster crows , you will disown me three times . " And he went outside and wept bitterly .
40027001	Early in the morning , all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed .
40027002	So they bound him , led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor .
40027003	When Judas , who had betrayed him , saw that Jesus was condemned , he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders .
40027004	" I have sinned , " he said , " for I have betrayed innocent blood . " " What is that to us ? " they replied . " That's your responsibility . "
40027005	So Judas threw the money into the temple and left . Then he went away and hanged himself .
40027006	The chief priests picked up the coins and said , " It is against the law to put this into the treasury , since it is blood money . "
40027007	So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners .
40027008	That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day .
40027009	Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled : " They took the thirty pieces of silver , the price set on him by the people of Israel ,
40027010	and they used them to buy the potter's field , as the Lord commanded me . "
40027011	Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , " Are you the king of the Jews ? " " You have said so , " Jesus replied .
40027012	When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders , he gave no answer .
40027013	Then Pilate asked him , " Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you ? "
40027014	But Jesus made no reply , not even to a single charge — to the great amazement of the governor .
40027015	Now it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd .
40027016	At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus Barabbas .
40027017	So when the crowd had gathered , Pilate asked them , " Which one do you want me to release to you : Jesus Barabbas , or Jesus who is called the Messiah ? "
40027018	For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him .
40027019	While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat , his wife sent him this message : " Don't have anything to do with that innocent man , for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him . "
40027020	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed .
40027021	" Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " asked the governor . " Barabbas , " they answered .
40027022	" What shall I do , then , with Jesus who is called the Messiah ? " Pilate asked . They all answered , " Crucify him ! "
40027023	" Why ? What crime has he committed ? " asked Pilate . But they shouted all the louder , " Crucify him ! "
40027024	When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere , but that instead an uproar was starting , he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd . " I am innocent of this man's blood , " he said . " It is your responsibility ! "
40027025	All the people answered , " His blood is on us and on our children ! "
40027026	Then he released Barabbas to them . But he had Jesus flogged , and handed him over to be crucified .
40027027	Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him .
40027028	They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him ,
40027029	and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head . They put a staff in his right hand . Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him . " Hail , king of the Jews ! " they said .
40027030	They spit on him , and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again .
40027031	After they had mocked him , they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him . Then they led him away to crucify him .
40027032	As they were going out , they met a man from Cyrene , named Simon , and they forced him to carry the cross .
40027033	They came to a place called Golgotha ( which means " the place of the skull " ) .
40027034	There they offered Jesus wine to drink , mixed with gall ; but after tasting it , he refused to drink it .
40027035	When they had crucified him , they divided up his clothes by casting lots .
40027036	And sitting down , they kept watch over him there .
40027037	Above his head they placed the written charge against him : this is jesus , the king of the jews .
40027038	Two rebels were crucified with him , one on his right and one on his left .
40027039	Those who passed by hurled insults at him , shaking their heads
40027040	and saying , " You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days , save yourself ! Come down from the cross , if you are the Son of God ! "
40027041	In the same way the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him .
40027042	" He saved others , " they said , " but he can't save himself ! He's the king of Israel ! Let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe in him .
40027043	He trusts in God . Let God rescue him now if he wants him , for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
40027044	In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him .
40027045	From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land .
40027046	About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice , " Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? " ( which means " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? " ) .
40027047	When some of those standing there heard this , they said , " He's calling Elijah . "
40027048	Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge . He filled it with wine vinegar , put it on a staff , and offered it to Jesus to drink .
40027049	The rest said , " Now leave him alone . Let's see if Elijah comes to save him . "
40027050	And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice , he gave up his spirit .
40027051	At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth shook , the rocks split
40027052	and the tombs broke open . The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life .
40027053	They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people .
40027054	When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened , they were terrified , and exclaimed , " Surely he was the Son of God ! "
40027055	Many women were there , watching from a distance . They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs .
40027056	Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedee's sons .
40027057	As evening approached , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who had himself become a disciple of Jesus .
40027058	Going to Pilate , he asked for Jesus' body , and Pilate ordered that it be given to him .
40027059	Joseph took the body , wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
40027060	and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock . He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away .
40027061	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb .
40027062	The next day , the one after Preparation Day , the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate .
40027063	" Sir , " they said , " we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said , ' After three days I will rise again . '
40027064	So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day . Otherwise , his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead . This last deception will be worse than the first . "
40027065	" Take a guard , " Pilate answered . " Go , make the tomb as secure as you know how . "
40027066	So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard .
40028001	After the Sabbath , at dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb .
40028002	There was a violent earthquake , for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and , going to the tomb , rolled back the stone and sat on it .
40028003	His appearance was like lightning , and his clothes were white as snow .
40028004	The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men .
40028005	The angel said to the women , " Do not be afraid , for I know that you are looking for Jesus , who was crucified .
40028006	He is not here ; he has risen , just as he said . Come and see the place where he lay .
40028007	Then go quickly and tell his disciples : ' He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee . There you will see him . ' Now I have told you . "
40028008	So the women hurried away from the tomb , afraid yet filled with joy , and ran to tell his disciples .
40028009	Suddenly Jesus met them . " Greetings , " he said . They came to him , clasped his feet and worshiped him .
40028010	Then Jesus said to them , " Do not be afraid . Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee ; there they will see me . "
40028011	While the women were on their way , some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened .
40028012	When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan , they gave the soldiers a large sum of money ,
40028013	telling them , " You are to say , ' His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep . '
40028014	If this report gets to the governor , we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble . "
40028015	So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed . And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day .
40028016	Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go .
40028017	When they saw him , they worshiped him ; but some doubted .
40028018	Then Jesus came to them and said , " All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
40028019	Therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
40028020	and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you . And surely I am with you always , to the very end of the age . "
41001001	The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah , the Son of God ,
41001002	as it is written in Isaiah the prophet :
41001004	And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness , preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
41001005	The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him . Confessing their sins , they were baptized by him in the Jordan River .
41001006	John wore clothing made of camel's hair , with a leather belt around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
41001007	And this was his message : " After me comes the one more powerful than I , the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie .
41001008	I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . "
41001009	At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
41001010	Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove .
41001011	And a voice came from heaven : " You are my Son , whom I love ; with you I am well pleased . "
41001012	At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness ,
41001013	and he was in the wilderness forty days , being tempted by Satan . He was with the wild animals , and angels attended him .
41001014	After John was put in prison , Jesus went into Galilee , proclaiming the good news of God .
41001015	" The time has come , " he said . " The kingdom of God has come near . Repent and believe the good news ! "
41001016	As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake , for they were fishermen .
41001017	" Come , follow me , " Jesus said , " and I will send you out to fish for people . "
41001018	At once they left their nets and followed him .
41001019	When he had gone a little farther , he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat , preparing their nets .
41001020	Without delay he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him .
41001021	They went to Capernaum , and when the Sabbath came , Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach .
41001022	The people were amazed at his teaching , because he taught them as one who had authority , not as the teachers of the law .
41001023	Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out ,
41001024	" What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are — the Holy One of God ! "
41001025	" Be quiet ! " said Jesus sternly . " Come out of him ! "
41001026	The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek .
41001027	The people were all so amazed that they asked each other , " What is this ? A new teaching — and with authority ! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him . "
41001028	News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee .
41001029	As soon as they left the synagogue , they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew .
41001030	Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever , and they immediately told Jesus about her .
41001031	So he went to her , took her hand and helped her up . The fever left her and she began to wait on them .
41001032	That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed .
41001033	The whole town gathered at the door ,
41001034	and Jesus healed many who had various diseases . He also drove out many demons , but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was .
41001035	Very early in the morning , while it was still dark , Jesus got up , left the house and went off to a solitary place , where he prayed .
41001036	Simon and his companions went to look for him ,
41001037	and when they found him , they exclaimed : " Everyone is looking for you ! "
41001038	Jesus replied , " Let us go somewhere else — to the nearby villages — so I can preach there also . That is why I have come . "
41001039	So he traveled throughout Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons .
41001040	A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees , " If you are willing , you can make me clean . "
41001041	Jesus was indignant . He reached out his hand and touched the man . " I am willing , " he said . " Be clean ! "
41001042	Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed .
41001043	Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning :
41001044	" See that you don't tell this to anyone . But go , show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing , as a testimony to them . "
41001045	Instead he went out and began to talk freely , spreading the news . As a result , Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places . Yet the people still came to him from everywhere .
41002001	A few days later , when Jesus again entered Capernaum , the people heard that he had come home .
41002002	They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left , not even outside the door , and he preached the word to them .
41002003	Some men came , bringing to him a paralyzed man , carried by four of them .
41002004	Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd , they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on .
41002005	When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralyzed man , " Son , your sins are forgiven . "
41002006	Now some teachers of the law were sitting there , thinking to themselves ,
41002007	" Why does this fellow talk like that ? He's blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? "
41002008	Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts , and he said to them , " Why are you thinking these things ?
41002009	Which is easier : to say to this paralyzed man , ' Your sins are forgiven , ' or to say , ' Get up , take your mat and walk ' ?
41002010	But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . " So he said to the man ,
41002011	" I tell you , get up , take your mat and go home . "
41002012	He got up , took his mat and walked out in full view of them all . This amazed everyone and they praised God , saying , " We have never seen anything like this ! "
41002013	Once again Jesus went out beside the lake . A large crowd came to him , and he began to teach them .
41002014	As he walked along , he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth . " Follow me , " Jesus told him , and Levi got up and followed him .
41002015	While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house , many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples , for there were many who followed him .
41002016	When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors , they asked his disciples : " Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? "
41002017	On hearing this , Jesus said to them , " It is not the healthy who need a doctor , but the sick . I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners . "
41002018	Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting . Some people came and asked Jesus , " How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting , but yours are not ? "
41002019	Jesus answered , " How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them ? They cannot , so long as they have him with them .
41002020	But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and on that day they will fast .
41002021	" No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment . Otherwise , the new piece will pull away from the old , making the tear worse .
41002022	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined . No , they pour new wine into new wineskins . "
41002023	One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields , and as his disciples walked along , they began to pick some heads of grain .
41002024	The Pharisees said to him , " Look , why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath ? "
41002025	He answered , " Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need ?
41002026	In the days of Abiathar the high priest , he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread , which is lawful only for priests to eat . And he also gave some to his companions . "
41002027	Then he said to them , " The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath .
41002028	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath . "
41003001	Another time Jesus went into the synagogue , and a man with a shriveled hand was there .
41003002	Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus , so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath .
41003003	Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand , " Stand up in front of everyone . "
41003004	Then Jesus asked them , " Which is lawful on the Sabbath : to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? " But they remained silent .
41003005	He looked around at them in anger and , deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts , said to the man , " Stretch out your hand . " He stretched it out , and his hand was completely restored .
41003006	Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus .
41003007	Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake , and a large crowd from Galilee followed .
41003008	When they heard about all he was doing , many people came to him from Judea , Jerusalem , Idumea , and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon .
41003009	Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him , to keep the people from crowding him .
41003010	For he had healed many , so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him .
41003011	Whenever the impure spirits saw him , they fell down before him and cried out , " You are the Son of God . "
41003012	But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him .
41003013	Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted , and they came to him .
41003014	He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach
41003015	and to have authority to drive out demons .
41003016	These are the twelve he appointed : Simon ( to whom he gave the name Peter ) ,
41003017	James son of Zebedee and his brother John ( to them he gave the name Boanerges , which means " sons of thunder " ) ,
41003018	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot
41003019	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him .
41003020	Then Jesus entered a house , and again a crowd gathered , so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat .
41003021	When his family heard about this , they went to take charge of him , for they said , " He is out of his mind . "
41003022	And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said , " He is possessed by Beelzebul ! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons . "
41003023	So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables : " How can Satan drive out Satan ?
41003024	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
41003025	If a house is divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
41003026	And if Satan opposes himself and is divided , he cannot stand ; his end has come .
41003027	In fact , no one can enter a strong man's house without first tying him up . Then he can plunder the strong man's house .
41003028	Truly I tell you , people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter ,
41003029	but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven ; they are guilty of an eternal sin . "
41003030	He said this because they were saying , " He has an impure spirit . "
41003031	Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived . Standing outside , they sent someone in to call him .
41003032	A crowd was sitting around him , and they told him , " Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you . "
41003033	" Who are my mother and my brothers ? " he asked .
41003034	Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said , " Here are my mother and my brothers !
41003035	Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother . "
41004001	Again Jesus began to teach by the lake . The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake , while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge .
41004002	He taught them many things by parables , and in his teaching said :
41004003	" Listen ! A farmer went out to sow his seed .
41004004	As he was scattering the seed , some fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
41004005	Some fell on rocky places , where it did not have much soil . It sprang up quickly , because the soil was shallow .
41004006	But when the sun came up , the plants were scorched , and they withered because they had no root .
41004007	Other seed fell among thorns , which grew up and choked the plants , so that they did not bear grain .
41004008	Still other seed fell on good soil . It came up , grew and produced a crop , some multiplying thirty , some sixty , some a hundred times . "
41004009	Then Jesus said , " Whoever has ears to hear , let them hear . "
41004010	When he was alone , the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables .
41004011	He told them , " The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you . But to those on the outside everything is said in parables
41004012	so that ,
41004014	The farmer sows the word .
41004015	Some people are like seed along the path , where the word is sown . As soon as they hear it , Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them .
41004016	Others , like seed sown on rocky places , hear the word and at once receive it with joy .
41004017	But since they have no root , they last only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the word , they quickly fall away .
41004018	Still others , like seed sown among thorns , hear the word ;
41004019	but the worries of this life , the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word , making it unfruitful .
41004020	Others , like seed sown on good soil , hear the word , accept it , and produce a crop — some thirty , some sixty , some a hundred times what was sown . "
41004021	He said to them , " Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed ? Instead , don't you put it on its stand ?
41004022	For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed , and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open .
41004023	If anyone has ears to hear , let them hear . "
41004024	" Consider carefully what you hear , " he continued . " With the measure you use , it will be measured to you — and even more .
41004025	Whoever has will be given more ; whoever does not have , even what they have will be taken from them . "
41004026	He also said , " This is what the kingdom of God is like . A man scatters seed on the ground .
41004027	Night and day , whether he sleeps or gets up , the seed sprouts and grows , though he does not know how .
41004028	All by itself the soil produces grain — first the stalk , then the head , then the full kernel in the head .
41004029	As soon as the grain is ripe , he puts the sickle to it , because the harvest has come . "
41004030	Again he said , " What shall we say the kingdom of God is like , or what parable shall we use to describe it ?
41004031	It is like a mustard seed , which is the smallest of all seeds on earth .
41004032	Yet when planted , it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants , with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade . "
41004033	With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them , as much as they could understand .
41004034	He did not say anything to them without using a parable . But when he was alone with his own disciples , he explained everything .
41004035	That day when evening came , he said to his disciples , " Let us go over to the other side . "
41004036	Leaving the crowd behind , they took him along , just as he was , in the boat . There were also other boats with him .
41004037	A furious squall came up , and the waves broke over the boat , so that it was nearly swamped .
41004038	Jesus was in the stern , sleeping on a cushion . The disciples woke him and said to him , " Teacher , don't you care if we drown ? "
41004039	He got up , rebuked the wind and said to the waves , " Quiet ! Be still ! " Then the wind died down and it was completely calm .
41004040	He said to his disciples , " Why are you so afraid ? Do you still have no faith ? "
41004041	They were terrified and asked each other , " Who is this ? Even the wind and the waves obey him ! "
41005001	They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes .
41005002	When Jesus got out of the boat , a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him .
41005003	This man lived in the tombs , and no one could bind him anymore , not even with a chain .
41005004	For he had often been chained hand and foot , but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet . No one was strong enough to subdue him .
41005005	Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones .
41005006	When he saw Jesus from a distance , he ran and fell on his knees in front of him .
41005007	He shouted at the top of his voice , " What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? In God's name don't torture me ! "
41005008	For Jesus had said to him , " Come out of this man , you impure spirit ! "
41005009	Then Jesus asked him , " What is your name ? " " My name is Legion , " he replied , " for we are many . "
41005010	And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area .
41005011	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside .
41005012	The demons begged Jesus , " Send us among the pigs ; allow us to go into them . "
41005013	He gave them permission , and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs . The herd , about two thousand in number , rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned .
41005014	Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside , and the people went out to see what had happened .
41005015	When they came to Jesus , they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons , sitting there , dressed and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
41005016	Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man — and told about the pigs as well .
41005017	Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region .
41005018	As Jesus was getting into the boat , the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him .
41005019	Jesus did not let him , but said , " Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you , and how he has had mercy on you . "
41005020	So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him . And all the people were amazed .
41005021	When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake , a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake .
41005022	Then one of the synagogue leaders , named Jairus , came , and when he saw Jesus , he fell at his feet .
41005023	He pleaded earnestly with him , " My little daughter is dying . Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live . "
41005024	So Jesus went with him . A large crowd followed and pressed around him .
41005025	And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years .
41005026	She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had , yet instead of getting better she grew worse .
41005027	When she heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak ,
41005028	because she thought , " If I just touch his clothes , I will be healed . "
41005029	Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering .
41005030	At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him . He turned around in the crowd and asked , " Who touched my clothes ? "
41005031	" You see the people crowding against you , " his disciples answered , " and yet you can ask , ' Who touched me ? ' "
41005032	But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it .
41005033	Then the woman , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell at his feet and , trembling with fear , told him the whole truth .
41005034	He said to her , " Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace and be freed from your suffering . "
41005035	While Jesus was still speaking , some people came from the house of Jairus , the synagogue leader . " Your daughter is dead , " they said . " Why bother the teacher anymore ? "
41005036	Overhearing what they said , Jesus told him , " Don't be afraid ; just believe . "
41005037	He did not let anyone follow him except Peter , James and John the brother of James .
41005038	When they came to the home of the synagogue leader , Jesus saw a commotion , with people crying and wailing loudly .
41005039	He went in and said to them , " Why all this commotion and wailing ? The child is not dead but asleep . "
41005040	But they laughed at him . After he put them all out , he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him , and went in where the child was .
41005041	He took her by the hand and said to her , " Talitha koum ! " ( which means " Little girl , I say to you , get up ! " ) .
41005042	Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around ( she was twelve years old ) . At this they were completely astonished .
41005043	He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this , and told them to give her something to eat .
41006001	Jesus left there and went to his hometown , accompanied by his disciples .
41006002	When the Sabbath came , he began to teach in the synagogue , and many who heard him were amazed . " Where did this man get these things ? " they asked . " What's this wisdom that has been given him ? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing ?
41006003	Isn't this the carpenter ? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James , Joseph , Judas and Simon ? Aren't his sisters here with us ? " And they took offense at him .
41006004	Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor except in his own town , among his relatives and in his own home . "
41006005	He could not do any miracles there , except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them .
41006006	He was amazed at their lack of faith . Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village .
41006007	Calling the Twelve to him , he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits .
41006008	These were his instructions : " Take nothing for the journey except a staff — no bread , no bag , no money in your belts .
41006009	Wear sandals but not an extra shirt .
41006010	Whenever you enter a house , stay there until you leave that town .
41006011	And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you , leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them . "
41006012	They went out and preached that people should repent .
41006013	They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them .
41006014	King Herod heard about this , for Jesus' name had become well known . Some were saying , " John the Baptist has been raised from the dead , and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him . "
41006015	Others said , " He is Elijah . " And still others claimed , " He is a prophet , like one of the prophets of long ago . "
41006016	But when Herod heard this , he said , " John , whom I beheaded , has been raised from the dead ! "
41006017	For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested , and he had him bound and put in prison . He did this because of Herodias , his brother Philip's wife , whom he had married .
41006018	For John had been saying to Herod , " It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife . "
41006019	So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him . But she was not able to ,
41006020	because Herod feared John and protected him , knowing him to be a righteous and holy man . When Herod heard John , he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him .
41006021	Finally the opportune time came . On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee .
41006022	When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced , she pleased Herod and his dinner guests . The king said to the girl , " Ask me for anything you want , and I'll give it to you . "
41006023	And he promised her with an oath , " Whatever you ask I will give you , up to half my kingdom . "
41006024	She went out and said to her mother , " What shall I ask for ? " " The head of John the Baptist , " she answered .
41006025	At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request : " I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter . "
41006026	The king was greatly distressed , but because of his oaths and his dinner guests , he did not want to refuse her .
41006027	So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head . The man went , beheaded John in the prison ,
41006028	and brought back his head on a platter . He presented it to the girl , and she gave it to her mother .
41006029	On hearing of this , John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb .
41006030	The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught .
41006031	Then , because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat , he said to them , " Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest . "
41006032	So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place .
41006033	But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them .
41006034	When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd , he had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd . So he began teaching them many things .
41006035	By this time it was late in the day , so his disciples came to him . " This is a remote place , " they said , " and it's already very late .
41006036	Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat . "
41006037	But he answered , " You give them something to eat . " They said to him , " That would take more than half a year's wages ! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat ? "
41006038	" How many loaves do you have ? " he asked . " Go and see . " When they found out , they said , " Five — and two fish . "
41006039	Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass .
41006040	So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties .
41006041	Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke the loaves . Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people . He also divided the two fish among them all .
41006042	They all ate and were satisfied ,
41006043	and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish .
41006044	The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand .
41006045	Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida , while he dismissed the crowd .
41006046	After leaving them , he went up on a mountainside to pray .
41006047	Later that night , the boat was in the middle of the lake , and he was alone on land .
41006048	He saw the disciples straining at the oars , because the wind was against them . Shortly before dawn he went out to them , walking on the lake . He was about to pass by them ,
41006049	but when they saw him walking on the lake , they thought he was a ghost . They cried out ,
41006050	because they all saw him and were terrified . Immediately he spoke to them and said , " Take courage ! It is I . Don't be afraid . "
41006051	Then he climbed into the boat with them , and the wind died down . They were completely amazed ,
41006052	for they had not understood about the loaves ; their hearts were hardened .
41006053	When they had crossed over , they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there .
41006054	As soon as they got out of the boat , people recognized Jesus .
41006055	They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was .
41006056	And wherever he went — into villages , towns or countryside — they placed the sick in the marketplaces . They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak , and all who touched it were healed .
41007001	The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus
41007002	and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled , that is , unwashed .
41007003	( The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing , holding to the tradition of the elders .
41007004	When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash . And they observe many other traditions , such as the washing of cups , pitchers and kettles . )
41007005	So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus , " Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands ? "
41007006	He replied , " Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites ; as it is written :
41007007	They worship me in vain ;
41007008	You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions . "
41007009	And he continued , " You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions !
41007010	For Moses said , ' Honor your father and mother , ' and , ' Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death . '
41007011	But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban ( that is , devoted to God ) —
41007012	then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother .
41007013	Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down . And you do many things like that . "
41007014	Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said , " Listen to me , everyone , and understand this .
41007015	Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them . Rather , it is what comes out of a person that defiles them . "
41007017	After he had left the crowd and entered the house , his disciples asked him about this parable .
41007018	" Are you so dull ? " he asked . " Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them ?
41007019	For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach , and then out of the body . " ( In saying this , Jesus declared all foods clean . )
41007020	He went on : " What comes out of a person is what defiles them .
41007021	For it is from within , out of a person's heart , that evil thoughts come — sexual immorality , theft , murder ,
41007022	adultery , greed , malice , deceit , lewdness , envy , slander , arrogance and folly .
41007023	All these evils come from inside and defile a person . "
41007024	Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre . He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it ; yet he could not keep his presence secret .
41007025	In fact , as soon as she heard about him , a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet .
41007026	The woman was a Greek , born in Syrian Phoenicia . She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter .
41007027	" First let the children eat all they want , " he told her , " for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs . "
41007028	" Lord , " she replied , " even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs . "
41007029	Then he told her , " For such a reply , you may go ; the demon has left your daughter . "
41007030	She went home and found her child lying on the bed , and the demon gone .
41007031	Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon , down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis .
41007032	There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk , and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him .
41007033	After he took him aside , away from the crowd , Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears . Then he spit and touched the man's tongue .
41007034	He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him , " Ephphatha ! " ( which means " Be opened ! " ) .
41007035	At this , the man's ears were opened , his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly .
41007036	Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone . But the more he did so , the more they kept talking about it .
41007037	People were overwhelmed with amazement . " He has done everything well , " they said . " He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak . "
41008001	During those days another large crowd gathered . Since they had nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples to him and said ,
41008002	" I have compassion for these people ; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat .
41008003	If I send them home hungry , they will collapse on the way , because some of them have come a long distance . "
41008004	His disciples answered , " But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them ? "
41008005	" How many loaves do you have ? " Jesus asked . " Seven , " they replied .
41008006	He told the crowd to sit down on the ground . When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks , he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people , and they did so .
41008007	They had a few small fish as well ; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them .
41008008	The people ate and were satisfied . Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over .
41008009	About four thousand were present . After he had sent them away ,
41008010	he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha .
41008011	The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus . To test him , they asked him for a sign from heaven .
41008012	He sighed deeply and said , " Why does this generation ask for a sign ? Truly I tell you , no sign will be given to it . "
41008013	Then he left them , got back into the boat and crossed to the other side .
41008014	The disciples had forgotten to bring bread , except for one loaf they had with them in the boat .
41008015	" Be careful , " Jesus warned them . " Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod . "
41008016	They discussed this with one another and said , " It is because we have no bread . "
41008017	Aware of their discussion , Jesus asked them : " Why are you talking about having no bread ? Do you still not see or understand ? Are your hearts hardened ?
41008018	Do you have eyes but fail to see , and ears but fail to hear ? And don't you remember ?
41008019	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up ? " " Twelve , " they replied .
41008020	" And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand , how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up ? " They answered , " Seven . "
41008021	He said to them , " Do you still not understand ? "
41008022	They came to Bethsaida , and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him .
41008023	He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village . When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him , Jesus asked , " Do you see anything ? "
41008024	He looked up and said , " I see people ; they look like trees walking around . "
41008025	Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes . Then his eyes were opened , his sight was restored , and he saw everything clearly .
41008026	Jesus sent him home , saying , " Don't even go into the village . "
41008027	Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi . On the way he asked them , " Who do people say I am ? "
41008028	They replied , " Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , one of the prophets . "
41008029	" But what about you ? " he asked . " Who do you say I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Messiah . "
41008030	Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him .
41008031	He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests and the teachers of the law , and that he must be killed and after three days rise again .
41008032	He spoke plainly about this , and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
41008033	But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples , he rebuked Peter . " Get behind me , Satan ! " he said . " You do not have in mind the concerns of God , but merely human concerns . "
41008034	Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said : " Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me .
41008035	For whoever wants to save their life will lose it , but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it .
41008036	What good is it for someone to gain the whole world , yet forfeit their soul ?
41008037	Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul ?
41008038	If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels . "
41009001	And he said to them , " Truly I tell you , some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power . "
41009002	After six days Jesus took Peter , James and John with him and led them up a high mountain , where they were all alone . There he was transfigured before them .
41009003	His clothes became dazzling white , whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them .
41009004	And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses , who were talking with Jesus .
41009005	Peter said to Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . Let us put up three shelters — one for you , one for Moses and one for Elijah . "
41009006	( He did not know what to say , they were so frightened . )
41009007	Then a cloud appeared and covered them , and a voice came from the cloud : " This is my Son , whom I love . Listen to him ! "
41009008	Suddenly , when they looked around , they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus .
41009009	As they were coming down the mountain , Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
41009010	They kept the matter to themselves , discussing what " rising from the dead " meant .
41009011	And they asked him , " Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? "
41009012	Jesus replied , " To be sure , Elijah does come first , and restores all things . Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected ?
41009013	But I tell you , Elijah has come , and they have done to him everything they wished , just as it is written about him . "
41009014	When they came to the other disciples , they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them .
41009015	As soon as all the people saw Jesus , they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him .
41009016	" What are you arguing with them about ? " he asked .
41009017	A man in the crowd answered , " Teacher , I brought you my son , who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech .
41009018	Whenever it seizes him , it throws him to the ground . He foams at the mouth , gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid . I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit , but they could not . "
41009019	" You unbelieving generation , " Jesus replied , " how long shall I stay with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring the boy to me . "
41009020	So they brought him . When the spirit saw Jesus , it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion . He fell to the ground and rolled around , foaming at the mouth .
41009021	Jesus asked the boy's father , " How long has he been like this ? " " From childhood , " he answered .
41009022	" It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him . But if you can do anything , take pity on us and help us . "
41009023	" ' If you can ' ? " said Jesus . " Everything is possible for one who believes . "
41009024	Immediately the boy's father exclaimed , " I do believe ; help me overcome my unbelief ! "
41009025	When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene , he rebuked the impure spirit . " You deaf and mute spirit , " he said , " I command you , come out of him and never enter him again . "
41009026	The spirit shrieked , convulsed him violently and came out . The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said , " He's dead . "
41009027	But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet , and he stood up .
41009028	After Jesus had gone indoors , his disciples asked him privately , " Why couldn't we drive it out ? "
41009029	He replied , " This kind can come out only by prayer . "
41009030	They left that place and passed through Galilee . Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were ,
41009031	because he was teaching his disciples . He said to them , " The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men . They will kill him , and after three days he will rise . "
41009032	But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it .
41009033	They came to Capernaum . When he was in the house , he asked them , " What were you arguing about on the road ? "
41009034	But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest .
41009035	Sitting down , Jesus called the Twelve and said , " Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last , and the servant of all . "
41009036	He took a little child whom he placed among them . Taking the child in his arms , he said to them ,
41009037	" Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me ; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me . "
41009038	" Teacher , " said John , " we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop , because he was not one of us . "
41009039	" Do not stop him , " Jesus said . " For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me ,
41009040	for whoever is not against us is for us .
41009041	Truly I tell you , anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward .
41009042	" If anyone causes one of these little ones — those who believe in me — to stumble , it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea .
41009043	If your hand causes you to stumble , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell , where the fire never goes out .
41009045	And if your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell .
41009047	And if your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out . It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell ,
41009048	where the worms that eat them do not die , and the fire is not quenched . '
41009049	Everyone will be salted with fire .
41009050	" Salt is good , but if it loses its saltiness , how can you make it salty again ? Have salt among yourselves , and be at peace with each other . "
41010001	Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan . Again crowds of people came to him , and as was his custom , he taught them .
41010002	Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking , " Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? "
41010003	" What did Moses command you ? " he replied .
41010004	They said , " Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away . "
41010005	" It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law , " Jesus replied .
41010006	" But at the beginning of creation God ' made them male and female . '
41010007	' For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife ,
41010008	and the two will become one flesh . ' So they are no longer two , but one flesh .
41010009	Therefore what God has joined together , let no one separate . "
41010010	When they were in the house again , the disciples asked Jesus about this .
41010011	He answered , " Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her .
41010012	And if she divorces her husband and marries another man , she commits adultery . "
41010013	People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them , but the disciples rebuked them .
41010014	When Jesus saw this , he was indignant . He said to them , " Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
41010015	Truly I tell you , anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it . "
41010016	And he took the children in his arms , placed his hands on them and blessed them .
41010017	As Jesus started on his way , a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him . " Good teacher , " he asked , " what must I do to inherit eternal life ? "
41010018	" Why do you call me good ? " Jesus answered . " No one is good — except God alone .
41010019	You know the commandments : ' You shall not murder , you shall not commit adultery , you shall not steal , you shall not give false testimony , you shall not defraud , honor your father and mother . ' "
41010020	" Teacher , " he declared , " all these I have kept since I was a boy . "
41010021	Jesus looked at him and loved him . " One thing you lack , " he said . " Go , sell everything you have and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me . "
41010022	At this the man's face fell . He went away sad , because he had great wealth .
41010023	Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , " How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God ! "
41010024	The disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus said again , " Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
41010025	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God . "
41010026	The disciples were even more amazed , and said to each other , " Who then can be saved ? "
41010027	Jesus looked at them and said , " With man this is impossible , but not with God ; all things are possible with God . "
41010028	Then Peter spoke up , " We have left everything to follow you ! "
41010029	" Truly I tell you , " Jesus replied , " no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
41010030	will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age : homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children and fields — along with persecutions — and in the age to come eternal life .
41010031	But many who are first will be last , and the last first . "
41010032	They were on their way up to Jerusalem , with Jesus leading the way , and the disciples were astonished , while those who followed were afraid . Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him .
41010033	" We are going up to Jerusalem , " he said , " and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law . They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles ,
41010034	who will mock him and spit on him , flog him and kill him . Three days later he will rise . "
41010035	Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to him . " Teacher , " they said , " we want you to do for us whatever we ask . "
41010036	" What do you want me to do for you ? " he asked .
41010037	They replied , " Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory . "
41010038	" You don't know what you are asking , " Jesus said . " Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with ? "
41010039	" We can , " they answered . Jesus said to them , " You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with ,
41010040	but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant . These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared . "
41010041	When the ten heard about this , they became indignant with James and John .
41010042	Jesus called them together and said , " You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their high officials exercise authority over them .
41010043	Not so with you . Instead , whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ,
41010044	and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all .
41010045	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many . "
41010046	Then they came to Jericho . As Jesus and his disciples , together with a large crowd , were leaving the city , a blind man , Bartimaeus ( which means " son of Timaeus " ) , was sitting by the roadside begging .
41010047	When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout , " Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! "
41010048	Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet , but he shouted all the more , " Son of David , have mercy on me ! "
41010049	Jesus stopped and said , " Call him . " So they called to the blind man , " Cheer up ! On your feet ! He's calling you . "
41010050	Throwing his cloak aside , he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus .
41010051	" What do you want me to do for you ? " Jesus asked him . The blind man said , " Rabbi , I want to see . "
41010052	" Go , " said Jesus , " your faith has healed you . " Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road .
41011001	As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent two of his disciples ,
41011002	saying to them , " Go to the village ahead of you , and just as you enter it , you will find a colt tied there , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
41011003	If anyone asks you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly . ' "
41011004	They went and found a colt outside in the street , tied at a doorway . As they untied it ,
41011005	some people standing there asked , " What are you doing , untying that colt ? "
41011006	They answered as Jesus had told them to , and the people let them go .
41011007	When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it , he sat on it .
41011008	Many people spread their cloaks on the road , while others spread branches they had cut in the fields .
41011009	Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted ,
41011011	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts . He looked around at everything , but since it was already late , he went out to Bethany with the Twelve .
41011012	The next day as they were leaving Bethany , Jesus was hungry .
41011013	Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf , he went to find out if it had any fruit . When he reached it , he found nothing but leaves , because it was not the season for figs .
41011014	Then he said to the tree , " May no one ever eat fruit from you again . " And his disciples heard him say it .
41011015	On reaching Jerusalem , Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there . He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves ,
41011016	and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts .
41011017	And as he taught them , he said , " Is it not written : ' My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations ' ? But you have made it ' a den of robbers . ' "
41011018	The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him , for they feared him , because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching .
41011019	When evening came , Jesus and his disciples went out of the city .
41011020	In the morning , as they went along , they saw the fig tree withered from the roots .
41011021	Peter remembered and said to Jesus , " Rabbi , look ! The fig tree you cursed has withered ! "
41011022	" Have faith in God , " Jesus answered .
41011023	" Truly I tell you , if anyone says to this mountain , ' Go , throw yourself into the sea , ' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen , it will be done for them .
41011024	Therefore I tell you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
41011025	And when you stand praying , if you hold anything against anyone , forgive them , so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins . "
41011027	They arrived again in Jerusalem , and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts , the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the elders came to him .
41011028	" By what authority are you doing these things ? " they asked . " And who gave you authority to do this ? "
41011029	Jesus replied , " I will ask you one question . Answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
41011030	John's baptism — was it from heaven , or of human origin ? Tell me ! "
41011031	They discussed it among themselves and said , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask , ' Then why didn't you believe him ? '
41011032	But if we say , ' Of human origin ' . . . " ( They feared the people , for everyone held that John really was a prophet . )
41011033	So they answered Jesus , " We don't know . " Jesus said , " Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things . "
41012001	Jesus then began to speak to them in parables : " A man planted a vineyard . He put a wall around it , dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower . Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place .
41012002	At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
41012003	But they seized him , beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
41012004	Then he sent another servant to them ; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully .
41012005	He sent still another , and that one they killed . He sent many others ; some of them they beat , others they killed .
41012006	" He had one left to send , a son , whom he loved . He sent him last of all , saying , ' They will respect my son . '
41012007	" But the tenants said to one another , ' This is the heir . Come , let's kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . '
41012008	So they took him and killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
41012009	" What then will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others .
41012010	Haven't you read this passage of Scripture :
41012012	Then the chief priests , the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them . But they were afraid of the crowd ; so they left him and went away .
41012013	Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words .
41012014	They came to him and said , " Teacher , we know that you are a man of integrity . You aren't swayed by others , because you pay no attention to who they are ; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not ?
41012015	Should we pay or shouldn't we ? " But Jesus knew their hypocrisy . " Why are you trying to trap me ? " he asked . " Bring me a denarius and let me look at it . "
41012016	They brought the coin , and he asked them , " Whose image is this ? And whose inscription ? " " Caesar's , " they replied .
41012017	Then Jesus said to them , " Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's . " And they were amazed at him .
41012018	Then the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him with a question .
41012019	" Teacher , " they said , " Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother .
41012020	Now there were seven brothers . The first one married and died without leaving any children .
41012021	The second one married the widow , but he also died , leaving no child . It was the same with the third .
41012022	In fact , none of the seven left any children . Last of all , the woman died too .
41012023	At the resurrection whose wife will she be , since the seven were married to her ? "
41012024	Jesus replied , " Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God ?
41012025	When the dead rise , they will neither marry nor be given in marriage ; they will be like the angels in heaven .
41012026	Now about the dead rising — have you not read in the Book of Moses , in the account of the burning bush , how God said to him , ' I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ' ?
41012027	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living . You are badly mistaken ! "
41012028	One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating . Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer , he asked him , " Of all the commandments , which is the most important ? "
41012029	" The most important one , " answered Jesus , " is this : ' Hear , O Israel : The Lord our God , the Lord is one .
41012030	Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength . '
41012031	The second is this : ' Love your neighbor as yourself . ' There is no commandment greater than these . "
41012032	" Well said , teacher , " the man replied . " You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him .
41012033	To love him with all your heart , with all your understanding and with all your strength , and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
41012034	When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely , he said to him , " You are not far from the kingdom of God . " And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions .
41012035	While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts , he asked , " Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David ?
41012036	David himself , speaking by the Holy Spirit , declared :
41012038	As he taught , Jesus said , " Watch out for the teachers of the law . They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces ,
41012039	and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
41012040	They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers . These men will be punished most severely . "
41012041	Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury . Many rich people threw in large amounts .
41012042	But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins , worth only a few cents .
41012043	Calling his disciples to him , Jesus said , " Truly I tell you , this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others .
41012044	They all gave out of their wealth ; but she , out of her poverty , put in everything — all she had to live on . "
41013001	As Jesus was leaving the temple , one of his disciples said to him , " Look , Teacher ! What massive stones ! What magnificent buildings ! "
41013002	" Do you see all these great buildings ? " replied Jesus . " Not one stone here will be left on another ; every one will be thrown down . "
41013003	As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter , James , John and Andrew asked him privately ,
41013004	" Tell us , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled ? "
41013005	Jesus said to them : " Watch out that no one deceives you .
41013006	Many will come in my name , claiming , ' I am he , ' and will deceive many .
41013007	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed . Such things must happen , but the end is still to come .
41013008	Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places , and famines . These are the beginning of birth pains .
41013009	" You must be on your guard . You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues . On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them .
41013010	And the gospel must first be preached to all nations .
41013011	Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial , do not worry beforehand about what to say . Just say whatever is given you at the time , for it is not you speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
41013012	" Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child . Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death .
41013013	Everyone will hate you because of me , but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved .
41013014	" When you see ' the abomination that causes desolation ' standing where it does not belong — let the reader understand — then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains .
41013015	Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out .
41013016	Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak .
41013017	How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers !
41013018	Pray that this will not take place in winter ,
41013019	because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning , when God created the world , until now — and never to be equaled again .
41013020	" If the Lord had not cut short those days , no one would survive . But for the sake of the elect , whom he has chosen , he has shortened them .
41013021	At that time if anyone says to you , ' Look , here is the Messiah ! ' or , ' Look , there he is ! ' do not believe it .
41013022	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
41013023	So be on your guard ; I have told you everything ahead of time .
41013024	" But in those days , following that distress ,
41013025	the stars will fall from the sky ,
41013026	" At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
41013027	And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens .
41013028	" Now learn this lesson from the fig tree : As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out , you know that summer is near .
41013029	Even so , when you see these things happening , you know that it is near , right at the door .
41013030	Truly I tell you , this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened .
41013031	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
41013032	" But about that day or hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
41013033	Be on guard ! Be alert ! You do not know when that time will come .
41013034	It's like a man going away : He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge , each with their assigned task , and tells the one at the door to keep watch .
41013035	" Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back — whether in the evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or at dawn .
41013036	If he comes suddenly , do not let him find you sleeping .
41013037	What I say to you , I say to everyone : ' Watch ! ' "
41014001	Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were only two days away , and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him .
41014002	" But not during the festival , " they said , " or the people may riot . "
41014003	While he was in Bethany , reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper , a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume , made of pure nard . She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head .
41014004	Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another , " Why this waste of perfume ?
41014005	It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor . " And they rebuked her harshly .
41014006	" Leave her alone , " said Jesus . " Why are you bothering her ? She has done a beautiful thing to me .
41014007	The poor you will always have with you , and you can help them any time you want . But you will not always have me .
41014008	She did what she could . She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial .
41014009	Truly I tell you , wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world , what she has done will also be told , in memory of her . "
41014010	Then Judas Iscariot , one of the Twelve , went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them .
41014011	They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money . So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over .
41014012	On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread , when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb , Jesus' disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover ? "
41014013	So he sent two of his disciples , telling them , " Go into the city , and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him .
41014014	Say to the owner of the house he enters , ' The Teacher asks : Where is my guest room , where I may eat the Passover with my disciples ? '
41014015	He will show you a large room upstairs , furnished and ready . Make preparations for us there . "
41014016	The disciples left , went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them . So they prepared the Passover .
41014017	When evening came , Jesus arrived with the Twelve .
41014018	While they were reclining at the table eating , he said , " Truly I tell you , one of you will betray me — one who is eating with me . "
41014019	They were saddened , and one by one they said to him , " Surely you don't mean me ? "
41014020	" It is one of the Twelve , " he replied , " one who dips bread into the bowl with me .
41014021	The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him . But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man ! It would be better for him if he had not been born . "
41014022	While they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it and gave it to his disciples , saying , " Take it ; this is my body . "
41014023	Then he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
41014024	" This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many , " he said to them .
41014025	" Truly I tell you , I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God . "
41014026	When they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
41014027	" You will all fall away , " Jesus told them , " for it is written :
41014029	Peter declared , " Even if all fall away , I will not . "
41014030	" Truly I tell you , " Jesus answered , " today — yes , tonight — before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times . "
41014031	But Peter insisted emphatically , " Even if I have to die with you , I will never disown you . " And all the others said the same .
41014032	They went to a place called Gethsemane , and Jesus said to his disciples , " Sit here while I pray . "
41014033	He took Peter , James and John along with him , and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled .
41014034	" My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death , " he said to them . " Stay here and keep watch . "
41014035	Going a little farther , he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him .
41014036	" Abba , Father , " he said , " everything is possible for you . Take this cup from me . Yet not what I will , but what you will . "
41014037	Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping . " Simon , " he said to Peter , " are you asleep ? Couldn't you keep watch for one hour ?
41014038	Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
41014039	Once more he went away and prayed the same thing .
41014040	When he came back , he again found them sleeping , because their eyes were heavy . They did not know what to say to him .
41014041	Returning the third time , he said to them , " Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough ! The hour has come . Look , the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners .
41014042	Rise ! Let us go ! Here comes my betrayer ! "
41014043	Just as he was speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , appeared . With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs , sent from the chief priests , the teachers of the law , and the elders .
41014044	Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them : " The one I kiss is the man ; arrest him and lead him away under guard . "
41014045	Going at once to Jesus , Judas said , " Rabbi ! " and kissed him .
41014046	The men seized Jesus and arrested him .
41014047	Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest , cutting off his ear .
41014048	" Am I leading a rebellion , " said Jesus , " that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me ?
41014049	Every day I was with you , teaching in the temple courts , and you did not arrest me . But the Scriptures must be fulfilled . "
41014050	Then everyone deserted him and fled .
41014051	A young man , wearing nothing but a linen garment , was following Jesus . When they seized him ,
41014052	he fled naked , leaving his garment behind .
41014053	They took Jesus to the high priest , and all the chief priests , the elders and the teachers of the law came together .
41014054	Peter followed him at a distance , right into the courtyard of the high priest . There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire .
41014055	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death , but they did not find any .
41014056	Many testified falsely against him , but their statements did not agree .
41014057	Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him :
41014058	" We heard him say , ' I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another , not made with hands . ' "
41014059	Yet even then their testimony did not agree .
41014060	Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus , " Are you not going to answer ? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you ? "
41014061	But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer . Again the high priest asked him , " Are you the Messiah , the Son of the Blessed One ? "
41014062	" I am , " said Jesus . " And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven . "
41014063	The high priest tore his clothes . " Why do we need any more witnesses ? " he asked .
41014064	" You have heard the blasphemy . What do you think ? " They all condemned him as worthy of death .
41014065	Then some began to spit at him ; they blindfolded him , struck him with their fists , and said , " Prophesy ! " And the guards took him and beat him .
41014066	While Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the servant girls of the high priest came by .
41014067	When she saw Peter warming himself , she looked closely at him . " You also were with that Nazarene , Jesus , " she said .
41014068	But he denied it . " I don't know or understand what you're talking about , " he said , and went out into the entryway .
41014069	When the servant girl saw him there , she said again to those standing around , " This fellow is one of them . "
41014070	Again he denied it . After a little while , those standing near said to Peter , " Surely you are one of them , for you are a Galilean . "
41014071	He began to call down curses , and he swore to them , " I don't know this man you're talking about . "
41014072	Immediately the rooster crowed the second time . Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him : " Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times . " And he broke down and wept .
41015001	Very early in the morning , the chief priests , with the elders , the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin , made their plans . So they bound Jesus , led him away and handed him over to Pilate .
41015002	" Are you the king of the Jews ? " asked Pilate . " You have said so , " Jesus replied .
41015003	The chief priests accused him of many things .
41015004	So again Pilate asked him , " Aren't you going to answer ? See how many things they are accusing you of . "
41015005	But Jesus still made no reply , and Pilate was amazed .
41015006	Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested .
41015007	A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising .
41015008	The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did .
41015009	" Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews ? " asked Pilate ,
41015010	knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him .
41015011	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead .
41015012	" What shall I do , then , with the one you call the king of the Jews ? " Pilate asked them .
41015013	" Crucify him ! " they shouted .
41015014	" Why ? What crime has he committed ? " asked Pilate . But they shouted all the louder , " Crucify him ! "
41015015	Wanting to satisfy the crowd , Pilate released Barabbas to them . He had Jesus flogged , and handed him over to be crucified .
41015016	The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace ( that is , the Praetorium ) and called together the whole company of soldiers .
41015017	They put a purple robe on him , then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him .
41015018	And they began to call out to him , " Hail , king of the Jews ! "
41015019	Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him . Falling on their knees , they paid homage to him .
41015020	And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him . Then they led him out to crucify him .
41015021	A certain man from Cyrene , Simon , the father of Alexander and Rufus , was passing by on his way in from the country , and they forced him to carry the cross .
41015022	They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha ( which means " the place of the skull " ) .
41015023	Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh , but he did not take it .
41015024	And they crucified him . Dividing up his clothes , they cast lots to see what each would get .
41015025	It was nine in the morning when they crucified him .
41015026	The written notice of the charge against him read : the king of the jews .
41015027	They crucified two rebels with him , one on his right and one on his left .
41015029	Those who passed by hurled insults at him , shaking their heads and saying , " So ! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days ,
41015030	come down from the cross and save yourself ! "
41015031	In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves . " He saved others , " they said , " but he can't save himself !
41015032	Let this Messiah , this king of Israel , come down now from the cross , that we may see and believe . " Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him .
41015033	At noon , darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon .
41015034	And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice , " Eloi , Eloi , lema sabachthani ? " ( which means " My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? " ) .
41015035	When some of those standing near heard this , they said , " Listen , he's calling Elijah . "
41015036	Someone ran , filled a sponge with wine vinegar , put it on a staff , and offered it to Jesus to drink . " Now leave him alone . Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down , " he said .
41015037	With a loud cry , Jesus breathed his last .
41015038	The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom .
41015039	And when the centurion , who stood there in front of Jesus , saw how he died , he said , " Surely this man was the Son of God ! "
41015040	Some women were watching from a distance . Among them were Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph , and Salome .
41015041	In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs . Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there .
41015042	It was Preparation Day ( that is , the day before the Sabbath ) . So as evening approached ,
41015043	Joseph of Arimathea , a prominent member of the Council , who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God , went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body .
41015044	Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead . Summoning the centurion , he asked him if Jesus had already died .
41015045	When he learned from the centurion that it was so , he gave the body to Joseph .
41015046	So Joseph bought some linen cloth , took down the body , wrapped it in the linen , and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock . Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb .
41015047	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid .
41016001	When the Sabbath was over , Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body .
41016002	Very early on the first day of the week , just after sunrise , they were on their way to the tomb
41016003	and they asked each other , " Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb ? "
41016004	But when they looked up , they saw that the stone , which was very large , had been rolled away .
41016005	As they entered the tomb , they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side , and they were alarmed .
41016006	" Don't be alarmed , " he said . " You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene , who was crucified . He has risen ! He is not here . See the place where they laid him .
41016007	But go , tell his disciples and Peter , ' He is going ahead of you into Galilee . There you will see him , just as he told you . ' "
41016008	Trembling and bewildered , the women went out and fled from the tomb . They said nothing to anyone , because they were afraid .
41016009	When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had driven seven demons .
41016010	She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping .
41016011	When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him , they did not believe it .
41016012	Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country .
41016013	These returned and reported it to the rest ; but they did not believe them either .
41016014	Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating ; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
41016015	He said to them , " Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation .
41016016	Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved , but whoever does not believe will be condemned .
41016017	And these signs will accompany those who believe : In my name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new tongues ;
41016018	they will pick up snakes with their hands ; and when they drink deadly poison , it will not hurt them at all ; they will place their hands on sick people , and they will get well . "
41016019	After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them , he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God .
41016020	Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere , and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it .
43001001	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
43001002	He was with God in the beginning .
43001003	Through him all things were made ; without him nothing was made that has been made .
43001004	In him was life , and that life was the light of all mankind .
43001005	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overcome it .
43001006	There was a man sent from God whose name was John .
43001007	He came as a witness to testify concerning that light , so that through him all might believe .
43001008	He himself was not the light ; he came only as a witness to the light .
43001009	The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world .
43001010	He was in the world , and though the world was made through him , the world did not recognize him .
43001011	He came to that which was his own , but his own did not receive him .
43001012	Yet to all who did receive him , to those who believed in his name , he gave the right to become children of God —
43001013	children born not of natural descent , nor of human decision or a husband's will , but born of God .
43001014	The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us . We have seen his glory , the glory of the one and only Son , who came from the Father , full of grace and truth .
43001015	( John testified concerning him . He cried out , saying , " This is the one I spoke about when I said , ' He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me . ' " )
43001016	Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given .
43001017	For the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
43001018	No one has ever seen God , but the one and only Son , who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father , has made him known .
43001019	Now this was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was .
43001020	He did not fail to confess , but confessed freely , " I am not the Messiah . "
43001021	They asked him , " Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? " He said , " I am not . " " Are you the Prophet ? " He answered , " No . "
43001022	Finally they said , " Who are you ? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? "
43001023	John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet , " I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness , ' Make straight the way for the Lord . ' "
43001024	Now the Pharisees who had been sent
43001025	questioned him , " Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? "
43001026	" I baptize with water , " John replied , " but among you stands one you do not know .
43001027	He is the one who comes after me , the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie . "
43001028	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
43001029	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said , " Look , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
43001030	This is the one I meant when I said , ' A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me . '
43001031	I myself did not know him , but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel . "
43001032	Then John gave this testimony : " I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him .
43001033	And I myself did not know him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me , ' The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit . '
43001034	I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One . "
43001035	The next day John was there again with two of his disciples .
43001036	When he saw Jesus passing by , he said , " Look , the Lamb of God ! "
43001037	When the two disciples heard him say this , they followed Jesus .
43001038	Turning around , Jesus saw them following and asked , " What do you want ? " They said , " Rabbi " ( which means " Teacher " ) , " where are you staying ? "
43001039	" Come , " he replied , " and you will see . " So they went and saw where he was staying , and they spent that day with him . It was about four in the afternoon .
43001040	Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus .
43001041	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him , " We have found the Messiah " ( that is , the Christ ) .
43001042	And he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , " You are Simon son of John . You will be called Cephas " ( which , when translated , is Peter ) .
43001043	The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee . Finding Philip , he said to him , " Follow me . "
43001044	Philip , like Andrew and Peter , was from the town of Bethsaida .
43001045	Philip found Nathanael and told him , " We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law , and about whom the prophets also wrote — Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . "
43001046	" Nazareth ! Can anything good come from there ? " Nathanael asked . " Come and see , " said Philip .
43001047	When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching , he said of him , " Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit . "
43001048	" How do you know me ? " Nathanael asked . Jesus answered , " I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you . "
43001049	Then Nathanael declared , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ; you are the king of Israel . "
43001050	Jesus said , " You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree . You will see greater things than that . "
43001051	He then added , " Very truly I tell you , you will see ' heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending on ' the Son of Man . "
43002001	On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee . Jesus' mother was there ,
43002002	and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding .
43002003	When the wine was gone , Jesus' mother said to him , " They have no more wine . "
43002004	" Woman , why do you involve me ? " Jesus replied . " My hour has not yet come . "
43002005	His mother said to the servants , " Do whatever he tells you . "
43002006	Nearby stood six stone water jars , the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing , each holding from twenty to thirty gallons .
43002007	Jesus said to the servants , " Fill the jars with water " ; so they filled them to the brim .
43002008	Then he told them , " Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet . " They did so ,
43002009	and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine . He did not realize where it had come from , though the servants who had drawn the water knew . Then he called the bridegroom aside
43002010	and said , " Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink ; but you have saved the best till now . "
43002011	What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory ; and his disciples believed in him .
43002012	After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples . There they stayed for a few days .
43002013	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover , Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
43002014	In the temple courts he found people selling cattle , sheep and doves , and others sitting at tables exchanging money .
43002015	So he made a whip out of cords , and drove all from the temple courts , both sheep and cattle ; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables .
43002016	To those who sold doves he said , " Get these out of here ! Stop turning my Father's house into a market ! "
43002017	His disciples remembered that it is written : " Zeal for your house will consume me . "
43002018	The Jews then responded to him , " What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this ? "
43002019	Jesus answered them , " Destroy this temple , and I will raise it again in three days . "
43002020	They replied , " It has taken forty-six years to build this temple , and you are going to raise it in three days ? "
43002021	But the temple he had spoken of was his body .
43002022	After he was raised from the dead , his disciples recalled what he had said . Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken .
43002023	Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival , many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name .
43002024	But Jesus would not entrust himself to them , for he knew all people .
43002025	He did not need any testimony about mankind , for he knew what was in each person .
43003001	Now there was a Pharisee , a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council .
43003002	He came to Jesus at night and said , " Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher who has come from God . For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him . "
43003003	Jesus replied , " Very truly I tell you , no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again . "
43003004	" How can someone be born when they are old ? " Nicodemus asked . " Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born ! "
43003005	Jesus answered , " Very truly I tell you , no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit .
43003006	Flesh gives birth to flesh , but the Spirit gives birth to spirit .
43003007	You should not be surprised at my saying , ' You must be born again . '
43003008	The wind blows wherever it pleases . You hear its sound , but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going . So it is with everyone born of the Spirit . "
43003009	" How can this be ? " Nicodemus asked .
43003010	" You are Israel's teacher , " said Jesus , " and do you not understand these things ?
43003011	Very truly I tell you , we speak of what we know , and we testify to what we have seen , but still you people do not accept our testimony .
43003012	I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe ; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things ?
43003013	No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven — the Son of Man .
43003014	Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness , so the Son of Man must be lifted up ,
43003015	that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him . "
43003016	For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life .
43003017	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but to save the world through him .
43003018	Whoever believes in him is not condemned , but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son .
43003019	This is the verdict : Light has come into the world , but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil .
43003020	Everyone who does evil hates the light , and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed .
43003021	But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light , so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God .
43003022	After this , Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside , where he spent some time with them , and baptized .
43003023	Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because there was plenty of water , and people were coming and being baptized .
43003024	( This was before John was put in prison . )
43003025	An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing .
43003026	They came to John and said to him , " Rabbi , that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan — the one you testified about — look , he is baptizing , and everyone is going to him . "
43003027	To this John replied , " A person can receive only what is given them from heaven .
43003028	You yourselves can testify that I said , ' I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him . '
43003029	The bride belongs to the bridegroom . The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him , and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice . That joy is mine , and it is now complete .
43003030	He must become greater ; I must become less . "
43003031	The one who comes from above is above all ; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks as one from the earth . The one who comes from heaven is above all .
43003032	He testifies to what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts his testimony .
43003033	Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful .
43003034	For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God gives the Spirit without limit .
43003035	The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands .
43003036	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life , but whoever rejects the Son will not see life , for God's wrath remains on them .
43004001	Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John —
43004002	although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized , but his disciples .
43004003	So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee .
43004004	Now he had to go through Samaria .
43004005	So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar , near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
43004006	Jacob's well was there , and Jesus , tired as he was from the journey , sat down by the well . It was about noon .
43004007	When a Samaritan woman came to draw water , Jesus said to her , " Will you give me a drink ? "
43004008	( His disciples had gone into the town to buy food . )
43004009	The Samaritan woman said to him , " You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman . How can you ask me for a drink ? " ( For Jews do not associate with Samaritans . )
43004010	Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink , you would have asked him and he would have given you living water . "
43004011	" Sir , " the woman said , " you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep . Where can you get this living water ?
43004012	Are you greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well and drank from it himself , as did also his sons and his livestock ? "
43004013	Jesus answered , " Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again ,
43004014	but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst . Indeed , the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life . "
43004015	The woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water . "
43004016	He told her , " Go , call your husband and come back . "
43004017	" I have no husband , " she replied . Jesus said to her , " You are right when you say you have no husband .
43004018	The fact is , you have had five husbands , and the man you now have is not your husband . What you have just said is quite true . "
43004019	" Sir , " the woman said , " I can see that you are a prophet .
43004020	Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain , but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem . "
43004021	" Woman , " Jesus replied , " believe me , a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
43004022	You Samaritans worship what you do not know ; we worship what we do know , for salvation is from the Jews .
43004023	Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth , for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks .
43004024	God is spirit , and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth . "
43004025	The woman said , " I know that Messiah " ( called Christ ) " is coming . When he comes , he will explain everything to us . "
43004026	Then Jesus declared , " I , the one speaking to you — I am he . "
43004027	Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman . But no one asked , " What do you want ? " or " Why are you talking with her ? "
43004028	Then , leaving her water jar , the woman went back to the town and said to the people ,
43004029	" Come , see a man who told me everything I ever did . Could this be the Messiah ? "
43004030	They came out of the town and made their way toward him .
43004031	Meanwhile his disciples urged him , " Rabbi , eat something . "
43004032	But he said to them , " I have food to eat that you know nothing about . "
43004033	Then his disciples said to each other , " Could someone have brought him food ? "
43004034	" My food , " said Jesus , " is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work .
43004035	Don't you have a saying , ' It's still four months until harvest ' ? I tell you , open your eyes and look at the fields ! They are ripe for harvest .
43004036	Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life , so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together .
43004037	Thus the saying ' One sows and another reaps ' is true .
43004038	I sent you to reap what you have not worked for . Others have done the hard work , and you have reaped the benefits of their labor . "
43004039	Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony , " He told me everything I ever did . "
43004040	So when the Samaritans came to him , they urged him to stay with them , and he stayed two days .
43004041	And because of his words many more became believers .
43004042	They said to the woman , " We no longer believe just because of what you said ; now we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world . "
43004043	After the two days he left for Galilee .
43004044	( Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country . )
43004045	When he arrived in Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him . They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival , for they also had been there .
43004046	Once more he visited Cana in Galilee , where he had turned the water into wine . And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum .
43004047	When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea , he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son , who was close to death .
43004048	" Unless you people see signs and wonders , " Jesus told him , " you will never believe . "
43004049	The royal official said , " Sir , come down before my child dies . "
43004050	" Go , " Jesus replied , " your son will live . " The man took Jesus at his word and departed .
43004051	While he was still on the way , his servants met him with the news that his boy was living .
43004052	When he inquired as to the time when his son got better , they said to him , " Yesterday , at one in the afternoon , the fever left him . "
43004053	Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him , " Your son will live . " So he and his whole household believed .
43004054	This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee .
43005001	Some time later , Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals .
43005002	Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool , which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades .
43005003	Here a great number of disabled people used to lie — the blind , the lame , the paralyzed .
43005005	One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years .
43005006	When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to get well ? "
43005007	" Sir , " the invalid replied , " I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred . While I am trying to get in , someone else goes down ahead of me . "
43005008	Then Jesus said to him , " Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk . "
43005009	At once the man was cured ; he picked up his mat and walked . The day on which this took place was a Sabbath ,
43005010	and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed , " It is the Sabbath ; the law forbids you to carry your mat . "
43005011	But he replied , " The man who made me well said to me , ' Pick up your mat and walk . ' "
43005012	So they asked him , " Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk ? "
43005013	The man who was healed had no idea who it was , for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there .
43005014	Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him , " See , you are well again . Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you . "
43005015	The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well .
43005016	So , because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath , the Jewish leaders began to persecute him .
43005017	In his defense Jesus said to them , " My Father is always at his work to this very day , and I too am working . "
43005018	For this reason they tried all the more to kill him ; not only was he breaking the Sabbath , but he was even calling God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
43005019	Jesus gave them this answer : " Very truly I tell you , the Son can do nothing by himself ; he can do only what he sees his Father doing , because whatever the Father does the Son also does .
43005020	For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does . Yes , and he will show him even greater works than these , so that you will be amazed .
43005021	For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it .
43005022	Moreover , the Father judges no one , but has entrusted all judgment to the Son ,
43005023	that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father . Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father , who sent him .
43005024	" Very truly I tell you , whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life .
43005025	Very truly I tell you , a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live .
43005026	For as the Father has life in himself , so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself .
43005027	And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man .
43005028	" Do not be amazed at this , for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
43005029	and come out — those who have done what is good will rise to live , and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned .
43005030	By myself I can do nothing ; I judge only as I hear , and my judgment is just , for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me .
43005031	" If I testify about myself , my testimony is not true .
43005032	There is another who testifies in my favor , and I know that his testimony about me is true .
43005033	" You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth .
43005034	Not that I accept human testimony ; but I mention it that you may be saved .
43005035	John was a lamp that burned and gave light , and you chose for a time to enjoy his light .
43005036	" I have testimony weightier than that of John . For the works that the Father has given me to finish — the very works that I am doing — testify that the Father has sent me .
43005037	And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me . You have never heard his voice nor seen his form ,
43005038	nor does his word dwell in you , for you do not believe the one he sent .
43005039	You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life . These are the very Scriptures that testify about me ,
43005040	yet you refuse to come to me to have life .
43005041	" I do not accept glory from human beings ,
43005042	but I know you . I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts .
43005043	I have come in my Father's name , and you do not accept me ; but if someone else comes in his own name , you will accept him .
43005044	How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God ?
43005045	" But do not think I will accuse you before the Father . Your accuser is Moses , on whom your hopes are set .
43005046	If you believed Moses , you would believe me , for he wrote about me .
43005047	But since you do not believe what he wrote , how are you going to believe what I say ? "
43006001	Some time after this , Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee ( that is , the Sea of Tiberias ) ,
43006002	and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick .
43006003	Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples .
43006004	The Jewish Passover Festival was near .
43006005	When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him , he said to Philip , " Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat ? "
43006006	He asked this only to test him , for he already had in mind what he was going to do .
43006007	Philip answered him , " It would take more than half a year's wages to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite ! "
43006008	Another of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , spoke up ,
43006009	" Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish , but how far will they go among so many ? "
43006010	Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " There was plenty of grass in that place , and they sat down ( about five thousand men were there ) .
43006011	Jesus then took the loaves , gave thanks , and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted . He did the same with the fish .
43006012	When they had all had enough to eat , he said to his disciples , " Gather the pieces that are left over . Let nothing be wasted . "
43006013	So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten .
43006014	After the people saw the sign Jesus performed , they began to say , " Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world . "
43006015	Jesus , knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force , withdrew again to a mountain by himself .
43006016	When evening came , his disciples went down to the lake ,
43006017	where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum . By now it was dark , and Jesus had not yet joined them .
43006018	A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough .
43006019	When they had rowed about three or four miles , they saw Jesus approaching the boat , walking on the water ; and they were frightened .
43006020	But he said to them , " It is I ; don't be afraid . "
43006021	Then they were willing to take him into the boat , and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading .
43006022	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there , and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples , but that they had gone away alone .
43006023	Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
43006024	Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus .
43006025	When they found him on the other side of the lake , they asked him , " Rabbi , when did you get here ? "
43006026	Jesus answered , " Very truly I tell you , you are looking for me , not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill .
43006027	Do not work for food that spoils , but for food that endures to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give you . For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval . "
43006028	Then they asked him , " What must we do to do the works God requires ? "
43006029	Jesus answered , " The work of God is this : to believe in the one he has sent . "
43006030	So they asked him , " What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you ? What will you do ?
43006031	Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written : ' He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ' "
43006032	Jesus said to them , " Very truly I tell you , it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven , but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven .
43006033	For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . "
43006034	" Sir , " they said , " always give us this bread . "
43006035	Then Jesus declared , " I am the bread of life . Whoever comes to me will never go hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
43006036	But as I told you , you have seen me and still you do not believe .
43006037	All those the Father gives me will come to me , and whoever comes to me I will never drive away .
43006038	For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me .
43006039	And this is the will of him who sent me , that I shall lose none of all those he has given me , but raise them up at the last day .
43006040	For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day . "
43006041	At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said , " I am the bread that came down from heaven . "
43006042	They said , " Is this not Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How can he now say , ' I came down from heaven ' ? "
43006043	" Stop grumbling among yourselves , " Jesus answered .
43006044	" No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them , and I will raise them up at the last day .
43006045	It is written in the Prophets : ' They will all be taught by God . ' Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me .
43006046	No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God ; only he has seen the Father .
43006047	Very truly I tell you , the one who believes has eternal life .
43006048	I am the bread of life .
43006049	Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness , yet they died .
43006050	But here is the bread that comes down from heaven , which anyone may eat and not die .
43006051	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will live forever . This bread is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world . "
43006052	Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
43006053	Jesus said to them , " Very truly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you have no life in you .
43006054	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise them up at the last day .
43006055	For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink .
43006056	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me , and I in them .
43006057	Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father , so the one who feeds on me will live because of me .
43006058	This is the bread that came down from heaven . Your ancestors ate manna and died , but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever . "
43006059	He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
43006060	On hearing it , many of his disciples said , " This is a hard teaching . Who can accept it ? "
43006061	Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this , Jesus said to them , " Does this offend you ?
43006062	Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before !
43006063	The Spirit gives life ; the flesh counts for nothing . The words I have spoken to you — they are full of the Spirit and life .
43006064	Yet there are some of you who do not believe . " For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him .
43006065	He went on to say , " This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them . "
43006066	From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him .
43006067	" You do not want to leave too , do you ? " Jesus asked the Twelve .
43006068	Simon Peter answered him , " Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
43006069	We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God . "
43006070	Then Jesus replied , " Have I not chosen you , the Twelve ? Yet one of you is a devil ! "
43006071	( He meant Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , who , though one of the Twelve , was later to betray him . )
43007001	After this , Jesus went around in Galilee . He did not want to go about in Judea because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him .
43007002	But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near ,
43007003	Jesus' brothers said to him , " Leave Galilee and go to Judea , so that your disciples there may see the works you do .
43007004	No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret . Since you are doing these things , show yourself to the world . "
43007005	For even his own brothers did not believe in him .
43007006	Therefore Jesus told them , " My time is not yet here ; for you any time will do .
43007007	The world cannot hate you , but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil .
43007008	You go to the festival . I am not going up to this festival , because my time has not yet fully come . "
43007009	After he had said this , he stayed in Galilee .
43007010	However , after his brothers had left for the festival , he went also , not publicly , but in secret .
43007011	Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking , " Where is he ? "
43007012	Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him . Some said , " He is a good man . " Others replied , " No , he deceives the people . "
43007013	But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders .
43007014	Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach .
43007015	The Jews there were amazed and asked , " How did this man get such learning without having been taught ? "
43007016	Jesus answered , " My teaching is not my own . It comes from the one who sent me .
43007017	Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own .
43007018	Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory , but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth ; there is nothing false about him .
43007019	Has not Moses given you the law ? Yet not one of you keeps the law . Why are you trying to kill me ? "
43007020	" You are demon-possessed , " the crowd answered . " Who is trying to kill you ? "
43007021	Jesus said to them , " I did one miracle , and you are all amazed .
43007022	Yet , because Moses gave you circumcision ( though actually it did not come from Moses , but from the patriarchs ) , you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath .
43007023	Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken , why are you angry with me for healing a man's whole body on the Sabbath ?
43007024	Stop judging by mere appearances , but instead judge correctly . "
43007025	At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask , " Isn't this the man they are trying to kill ?
43007026	Here he is , speaking publicly , and they are not saying a word to him . Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah ?
43007027	But we know where this man is from ; when the Messiah comes , no one will know where he is from . "
43007028	Then Jesus , still teaching in the temple courts , cried out , " Yes , you know me , and you know where I am from . I am not here on my own authority , but he who sent me is true . You do not know him ,
43007029	but I know him because I am from him and he sent me . "
43007030	At this they tried to seize him , but no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
43007031	Still , many in the crowd believed in him . They said , " When the Messiah comes , will he perform more signs than this man ? "
43007032	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him . Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him .
43007033	Jesus said , " I am with you for only a short time , and then I am going to the one who sent me .
43007034	You will look for me , but you will not find me ; and where I am , you cannot come . "
43007035	The Jews said to one another , " Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him ? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
43007036	What did he mean when he said , ' You will look for me , but you will not find me , ' and ' Where I am , you cannot come ' ? "
43007037	On the last and greatest day of the festival , Jesus stood and said in a loud voice , " Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink .
43007038	Whoever believes in me , as Scripture has said , rivers of living water will flow from within them . "
43007039	By this he meant the Spirit , whom those who believed in him were later to receive . Up to that time the Spirit had not been given , since Jesus had not yet been glorified .
43007040	On hearing his words , some of the people said , " Surely this man is the Prophet . "
43007041	Others said , " He is the Messiah . " Still others asked , " How can the Messiah come from Galilee ?
43007042	Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's descendants and from Bethlehem , the town where David lived ? "
43007043	Thus the people were divided because of Jesus .
43007044	Some wanted to seize him , but no one laid a hand on him .
43007045	Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees , who asked them , " Why didn't you bring him in ? "
43007046	" No one ever spoke the way this man does , " the guards replied .
43007047	" You mean he has deceived you also ? " the Pharisees retorted .
43007048	" Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him ?
43007049	No ! But this mob that knows nothing of the law — there is a curse on them . "
43007050	Nicodemus , who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number , asked ,
43007051	" Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing ? "
43007052	They replied , " Are you from Galilee , too ? Look into it , and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee . "
43007053	Then they all went home ,
43008001	but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
43008002	At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts , where all the people gathered around him , and he sat down to teach them .
43008003	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery . They made her stand before the group
43008004	and said to Jesus , " Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
43008005	In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women . Now what do you say ? "
43008006	They were using this question as a trap , in order to have a basis for accusing him . But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger .
43008007	When they kept on questioning him , he straightened up and said to them , " Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her . "
43008008	Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground .
43008009	At this , those who heard began to go away one at a time , the older ones first , until only Jesus was left , with the woman still standing there .
43008010	Jesus straightened up and asked her , " Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? "
43008011	" No one , sir , " she said . " Then neither do I condemn you , " Jesus declared . " Go now and leave your life of sin . "
43008012	When Jesus spoke again to the people , he said , " I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . "
43008013	The Pharisees challenged him , " Here you are , appearing as your own witness ; your testimony is not valid . "
43008014	Jesus answered , " Even if I testify on my own behalf , my testimony is valid , for I know where I came from and where I am going . But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going .
43008015	You judge by human standards ; I pass judgment on no one .
43008016	But if I do judge , my decisions are true , because I am not alone . I stand with the Father , who sent me .
43008017	In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true .
43008018	I am one who testifies for myself ; my other witness is the Father , who sent me . "
43008019	Then they asked him , " Where is your father ? " " You do not know me or my Father , " Jesus replied . " If you knew me , you would know my Father also . "
43008020	He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put . Yet no one seized him , because his hour had not yet come .
43008021	Once more Jesus said to them , " I am going away , and you will look for me , and you will die in your sin . Where I go , you cannot come . "
43008022	This made the Jews ask , " Will he kill himself ? Is that why he says , ' Where I go , you cannot come ' ? "
43008023	But he continued , " You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ; I am not of this world .
43008024	I told you that you would die in your sins ; if you do not believe that I am he , you will indeed die in your sins . "
43008025	" Who are you ? " they asked . " Just what I have been telling you from the beginning , " Jesus replied .
43008026	" I have much to say in judgment of you . But he who sent me is trustworthy , and what I have heard from him I tell the world . "
43008027	They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father .
43008028	So Jesus said , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me .
43008029	The one who sent me is with me ; he has not left me alone , for I always do what pleases him . "
43008030	Even as he spoke , many believed in him .
43008031	To the Jews who had believed him , Jesus said , " If you hold to my teaching , you are really my disciples .
43008032	Then you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . "
43008033	They answered him , " We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone . How can you say that we shall be set free ? "
43008034	Jesus replied , " Very truly I tell you , everyone who sins is a slave to sin .
43008035	Now a slave has no permanent place in the family , but a son belongs to it forever .
43008036	So if the Son sets you free , you will be free indeed .
43008037	I know that you are Abraham's descendants . Yet you are looking for a way to kill me , because you have no room for my word .
43008038	I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence , and you are doing what you have heard from your father . "
43008039	" Abraham is our father , " they answered . " If you were Abraham's children , " said Jesus , " then you would do what Abraham did .
43008040	As it is , you are looking for a way to kill me , a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God . Abraham did not do such things .
43008041	You are doing the works of your own father . " " We are not illegitimate children , " they protested . " The only Father we have is God himself . "
43008042	Jesus said to them , " If God were your Father , you would love me , for I have come here from God . I have not come on my own ; God sent me .
43008043	Why is my language not clear to you ? Because you are unable to hear what I say .
43008044	You belong to your father , the devil , and you want to carry out your father's desires . He was a murderer from the beginning , not holding to the truth , for there is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks his native language , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
43008045	Yet because I tell the truth , you do not believe me !
43008046	Can any of you prove me guilty of sin ? If I am telling the truth , why don't you believe me ?
43008047	Whoever belongs to God hears what God says . The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God . "
43008048	The Jews answered him , " Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed ? "
43008049	" I am not possessed by a demon , " said Jesus , " but I honor my Father and you dishonor me .
43008050	I am not seeking glory for myself ; but there is one who seeks it , and he is the judge .
43008051	Very truly I tell you , whoever obeys my word will never see death . "
43008052	At this they exclaimed , " Now we know that you are demon-possessed ! Abraham died and so did the prophets , yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death .
43008053	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and so did the prophets . Who do you think you are ? "
43008054	Jesus replied , " If I glorify myself , my glory means nothing . My Father , whom you claim as your God , is the one who glorifies me .
43008055	Though you do not know him , I know him . If I said I did not , I would be a liar like you , but I do know him and obey his word .
43008056	Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day ; he saw it and was glad . "
43008057	" You are not yet fifty years old , " they said to him , " and you have seen Abraham ! "
43008058	" Very truly I tell you , " Jesus answered , " before Abraham was born , I am ! "
43008059	At this , they picked up stones to stone him , but Jesus hid himself , slipping away from the temple grounds .
43009001	As he went along , he saw a man blind from birth .
43009002	His disciples asked him , " Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? "
43009003	" Neither this man nor his parents sinned , " said Jesus , " but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him .
43009004	As long as it is day , we must do the works of him who sent me . Night is coming , when no one can work .
43009005	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . "
43009006	After saying this , he spit on the ground , made some mud with the saliva , and put it on the man's eyes .
43009007	" Go , " he told him , " wash in the Pool of Siloam " ( this word means " Sent " ) . So the man went and washed , and came home seeing .
43009008	His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked , " Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg ? "
43009009	Some claimed that he was . Others said , " No , he only looks like him . " But he himself insisted , " I am the man . "
43009010	" How then were your eyes opened ? " they asked .
43009011	He replied , " The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes . He told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and then I could see . "
43009012	" Where is this man ? " they asked him . " I don't know , " he said .
43009013	They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
43009014	Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath .
43009015	Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . " He put mud on my eyes , " the man replied , " and I washed , and now I see . "
43009016	Some of the Pharisees said , " This man is not from God , for he does not keep the Sabbath . " But others asked , " How can a sinner perform such signs ? " So they were divided .
43009017	Then they turned again to the blind man , " What have you to say about him ? It was your eyes he opened . " The man replied , " He is a prophet . "
43009018	They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents .
43009019	" Is this your son ? " they asked . " Is this the one you say was born blind ? How is it that now he can see ? "
43009020	" We know he is our son , " the parents answered , " and we know he was born blind .
43009021	But how he can see now , or who opened his eyes , we don't know . Ask him . He is of age ; he will speak for himself . "
43009022	His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders , who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue .
43009023	That was why his parents said , " He is of age ; ask him . "
43009024	A second time they summoned the man who had been blind . " Give glory to God by telling the truth , " they said . " We know this man is a sinner . "
43009025	He replied , " Whether he is a sinner or not , I don't know . One thing I do know . I was blind but now I see ! "
43009026	Then they asked him , " What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? "
43009027	He answered , " I have told you already and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples too ? "
43009028	Then they hurled insults at him and said , " You are this fellow's disciple ! We are disciples of Moses !
43009029	We know that God spoke to Moses , but as for this fellow , we don't even know where he comes from . "
43009030	The man answered , " Now that is remarkable ! You don't know where he comes from , yet he opened my eyes .
43009031	We know that God does not listen to sinners . He listens to the godly person who does his will .
43009032	Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind .
43009033	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . "
43009034	To this they replied , " You were steeped in sin at birth ; how dare you lecture us ! " And they threw him out .
43009035	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , and when he found him , he said , " Do you believe in the Son of Man ? "
43009036	" Who is he , sir ? " the man asked . " Tell me so that I may believe in him . "
43009037	Jesus said , " You have now seen him ; in fact , he is the one speaking with you . "
43009038	Then the man said , " Lord , I believe , " and he worshiped him .
43009039	Jesus said , " For judgment I have come into this world , so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind . "
43009040	Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked , " What ? Are we blind too ? "
43009041	Jesus said , " If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin ; but now that you claim you can see , your guilt remains .
43010001	" Very truly I tell you Pharisees , anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate , but climbs in by some other way , is a thief and a robber .
43010002	The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep .
43010003	The gatekeeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
43010004	When he has brought out all his own , he goes on ahead of them , and his sheep follow him because they know his voice .
43010005	But they will never follow a stranger ; in fact , they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice . "
43010006	Jesus used this figure of speech , but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them .
43010007	Therefore Jesus said again , " Very truly I tell you , I am the gate for the sheep .
43010008	All who have come before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep have not listened to them .
43010009	I am the gate ; whoever enters through me will be saved . They will come in and go out , and find pasture .
43010010	The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy ; I have come that they may have life , and have it to the full .
43010011	" I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
43010012	The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep . So when he sees the wolf coming , he abandons the sheep and runs away . Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it .
43010013	The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep .
43010014	" I am the good shepherd ; I know my sheep and my sheep know me —
43010015	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father — and I lay down my life for the sheep .
43010016	I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen . I must bring them also . They too will listen to my voice , and there shall be one flock and one shepherd .
43010017	The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life — only to take it up again .
43010018	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of my own accord . I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again . This command I received from my Father . "
43010019	The Jews who heard these words were again divided .
43010020	Many of them said , " He is demon-possessed and raving mad . Why listen to him ? "
43010021	But others said , " These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? "
43010022	Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
43010023	and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade .
43010024	The Jews who were there gathered around him , saying , " How long will you keep us in suspense ? If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly . "
43010025	Jesus answered , " I did tell you , but you do not believe . The works I do in my Father's name testify about me ,
43010026	but you do not believe because you are not my sheep .
43010027	My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me .
43010028	I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish ; no one will snatch them out of my hand .
43010029	My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all ; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand .
43010030	I and the Father are one . "
43010031	Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him ,
43010032	but Jesus said to them , " I have shown you many good works from the Father . For which of these do you stone me ? "
43010033	" We are not stoning you for any good work , " they replied , " but for blasphemy , because you , a mere man , claim to be God . "
43010034	Jesus answered them , " Is it not written in your Law , ' I have said you are " gods " ' ?
43010035	If he called them ' gods , ' to whom the word of God came — and Scripture cannot be set aside —
43010036	what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world ? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said , ' I am God's Son ' ?
43010037	Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father .
43010038	But if I do them , even though you do not believe me , believe the works , that you may know and understand that the Father is in me , and I in the Father . "
43010039	Again they tried to seize him , but he escaped their grasp .
43010040	Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days . There he stayed ,
43010041	and many people came to him . They said , " Though John never performed a sign , all that John said about this man was true . "
43010042	And in that place many believed in Jesus .
43011001	Now a man named Lazarus was sick . He was from Bethany , the village of Mary and her sister Martha .
43011002	( This Mary , whose brother Lazarus now lay sick , was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair . )
43011003	So the sisters sent word to Jesus , " Lord , the one you love is sick . "
43011004	When he heard this , Jesus said , " This sickness will not end in death . No , it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it . "
43011005	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
43011006	So when he heard that Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was two more days ,
43011007	and then he said to his disciples , " Let us go back to Judea . "
43011008	" But Rabbi , " they said , " a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you , and yet you are going back ? "
43011009	Jesus answered , " Are there not twelve hours of daylight ? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble , for they see by this world's light .
43011010	It is when a person walks at night that they stumble , for they have no light . "
43011011	After he had said this , he went on to tell them , " Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep ; but I am going there to wake him up . "
43011012	His disciples replied , " Lord , if he sleeps , he will get better . "
43011013	Jesus had been speaking of his death , but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep .
43011014	So then he told them plainly , " Lazarus is dead ,
43011015	and for your sake I am glad I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him . "
43011016	Then Thomas ( also known as Didymus ) said to the rest of the disciples , " Let us also go , that we may die with him . "
43011017	On his arrival , Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days .
43011018	Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem ,
43011019	and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother .
43011020	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him , but Mary stayed at home .
43011021	" Lord , " Martha said to Jesus , " if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
43011022	But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask . "
43011023	Jesus said to her , " Your brother will rise again . "
43011024	Martha answered , " I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . "
43011025	Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . The one who believes in me will live , even though they die ;
43011026	and whoever lives by believing in me will never die . Do you believe this ? "
43011027	" Yes , Lord , " she replied , " I believe that you are the Messiah , the Son of God , who is to come into the world . "
43011028	After she had said this , she went back and called her sister Mary aside . " The Teacher is here , " she said , " and is asking for you . "
43011029	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to him .
43011030	Now Jesus had not yet entered the village , but was still at the place where Martha had met him .
43011031	When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house , comforting her , noticed how quickly she got up and went out , they followed her , supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there .
43011032	When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet and said , " Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . "
43011033	When Jesus saw her weeping , and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping , he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled .
43011034	" Where have you laid him ? " he asked . " Come and see , Lord , " they replied .
43011035	Jesus wept .
43011036	Then the Jews said , " See how he loved him ! "
43011037	But some of them said , " Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying ? "
43011038	Jesus , once more deeply moved , came to the tomb . It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance .
43011039	" Take away the stone , " he said . " But , Lord , " said Martha , the sister of the dead man , " by this time there is a bad odor , for he has been there four days . "
43011040	Then Jesus said , " Did I not tell you that if you believe , you will see the glory of God ? "
43011041	So they took away the stone . Then Jesus looked up and said , " Father , I thank you that you have heard me .
43011042	I knew that you always hear me , but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here , that they may believe that you sent me . "
43011043	When he had said this , Jesus called in a loud voice , " Lazarus , come out ! "
43011044	The dead man came out , his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen , and a cloth around his face . Jesus said to them , " Take off the grave clothes and let him go . "
43011045	Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary , and had seen what Jesus did , believed in him .
43011046	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
43011047	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin . " What are we accomplishing ? " they asked . " Here is this man performing many signs .
43011048	If we let him go on like this , everyone will believe in him , and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation . "
43011049	Then one of them , named Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , spoke up , " You know nothing at all !
43011050	You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish . "
43011051	He did not say this on his own , but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation ,
43011052	and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God , to bring them together and make them one .
43011053	So from that day on they plotted to take his life .
43011054	Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea . Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness , to a village called Ephraim , where he stayed with his disciples .
43011055	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover , many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover .
43011056	They kept looking for Jesus , and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another , " What do you think ? Isn't he coming to the festival at all ? "
43011057	But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him .
43012001	Six days before the Passover , Jesus came to Bethany , where Lazarus lived , whom Jesus had raised from the dead .
43012002	Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor . Martha served , while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him .
43012003	Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard , an expensive perfume ; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair . And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
43012004	But one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , who was later to betray him , objected ,
43012005	" Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor ? It was worth a year's wages . "
43012006	He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief ; as keeper of the money bag , he used to help himself to what was put into it .
43012007	" Leave her alone , " Jesus replied . " It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial .
43012008	You will always have the poor among you , but you will not always have me . "
43012009	Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came , not only because of him but also to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
43012010	So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well ,
43012011	for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him .
43012012	The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem .
43012013	They took palm branches and went out to meet him , shouting ,
43012015	" Do not be afraid , Daughter Zion ;
43012016	At first his disciples did not understand all this . Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him .
43012017	Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word .
43012018	Many people , because they had heard that he had performed this sign , went out to meet him .
43012019	So the Pharisees said to one another , " See , this is getting us nowhere . Look how the whole world has gone after him ! "
43012020	Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival .
43012021	They came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , with a request . " Sir , " they said , " we would like to see Jesus . "
43012022	Philip went to tell Andrew ; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus .
43012023	Jesus replied , " The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
43012024	Very truly I tell you , unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies , it remains only a single seed . But if it dies , it produces many seeds .
43012025	Anyone who loves their life will lose it , while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life .
43012026	Whoever serves me must follow me ; and where I am , my servant also will be . My Father will honor the one who serves me .
43012027	" Now my soul is troubled , and what shall I say ? ' Father , save me from this hour ' ? No , it was for this very reason I came to this hour .
43012028	Father , glorify your name ! " Then a voice came from heaven , " I have glorified it , and will glorify it again . "
43012029	The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered ; others said an angel had spoken to him .
43012030	Jesus said , " This voice was for your benefit , not mine .
43012031	Now is the time for judgment on this world ; now the prince of this world will be driven out .
43012032	And I , when I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all people to myself . "
43012033	He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die .
43012034	The crowd spoke up , " We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever , so how can you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ' ? Who is this ' Son of Man ' ? "
43012035	Then Jesus told them , " You are going to have the light just a little while longer . Walk while you have the light , before darkness overtakes you . Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going .
43012036	Believe in the light while you have the light , so that you may become children of light . " When he had finished speaking , Jesus left and hid himself from them .
43012037	Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence , they still would not believe in him .
43012038	This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet :
43012040	" He has blinded their eyes
43012041	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him .
43012042	Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him . But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue ;
43012043	for they loved human praise more than praise from God .
43012044	Then Jesus cried out , " Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only , but in the one who sent me .
43012045	The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me .
43012046	I have come into the world as a light , so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness .
43012047	" If anyone hears my words but does not keep them , I do not judge that person . For I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
43012048	There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words ; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day .
43012049	For I did not speak on my own , but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken .
43012050	I know that his command leads to eternal life . So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say . "
43013001	It was just before the Passover Festival . Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father . Having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
43013002	The evening meal was in progress , and the devil had already prompted Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , to betray Jesus .
43013003	Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power , and that he had come from God and was returning to God ;
43013004	so he got up from the meal , took off his outer clothing , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
43013005	After that , he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet , drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him .
43013006	He came to Simon Peter , who said to him , " Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? "
43013007	Jesus replied , " You do not realize now what I am doing , but later you will understand . "
43013008	" No , " said Peter , " you shall never wash my feet . " Jesus answered , " Unless I wash you , you have no part with me . "
43013009	" Then , Lord , " Simon Peter replied , " not just my feet but my hands and my head as well ! "
43013010	Jesus answered , " Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet ; their whole body is clean . And you are clean , though not every one of you . "
43013011	For he knew who was going to betray him , and that was why he said not every one was clean .
43013012	When he had finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes and returned to his place . " Do you understand what I have done for you ? " he asked them .
43013013	" You call me ' Teacher ' and ' Lord , ' and rightly so , for that is what I am .
43013014	Now that I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also should wash one another's feet .
43013015	I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you .
43013016	Very truly I tell you , no servant is greater than his master , nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him .
43013017	Now that you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them .
43013018	" I am not referring to all of you ; I know those I have chosen . But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture : ' He who shared my bread has turned against me . '
43013019	" I am telling you now before it happens , so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am .
43013020	Very truly I tell you , whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me ; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me . "
43013021	After he had said this , Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified , " Very truly I tell you , one of you is going to betray me . "
43013022	His disciples stared at one another , at a loss to know which of them he meant .
43013023	One of them , the disciple whom Jesus loved , was reclining next to him .
43013024	Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said , " Ask him which one he means . "
43013025	Leaning back against Jesus , he asked him , " Lord , who is it ? "
43013026	Jesus answered , " It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish . " Then , dipping the piece of bread , he gave it to Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot .
43013027	As soon as Judas took the bread , Satan entered into him . So Jesus told him , " What you are about to do , do quickly . "
43013028	But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him .
43013029	Since Judas had charge of the money , some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival , or to give something to the poor .
43013030	As soon as Judas had taken the bread , he went out . And it was night .
43013031	When he was gone , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him .
43013032	If God is glorified in him , God will glorify the Son in himself , and will glorify him at once .
43013033	" My children , I will be with you only a little longer . You will look for me , and just as I told the Jews , so I tell you now : Where I am going , you cannot come .
43013034	" A new command I give you : Love one another . As I have loved you , so you must love one another .
43013035	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples , if you love one another . "
43013036	Simon Peter asked him , " Lord , where are you going ? " Jesus replied , " Where I am going , you cannot follow now , but you will follow later . "
43013037	Peter asked , " Lord , why can't I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you . "
43013038	Then Jesus answered , " Will you really lay down your life for me ? Very truly I tell you , before the rooster crows , you will disown me three times !
43014001	" Do not let your hearts be troubled . You believe in God ; believe also in me .
43014002	My Father's house has many rooms ; if that were not so , would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you ?
43014003	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am .
43014004	You know the way to the place where I am going . "
43014005	Thomas said to him , " Lord , we don't know where you are going , so how can we know the way ? "
43014006	Jesus answered , " I am the way and the truth and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
43014007	If you really know me , you will know my Father as well . From now on , you do know him and have seen him . "
43014008	Philip said , " Lord , show us the Father and that will be enough for us . "
43014009	Jesus answered : " Don't you know me , Philip , even after I have been among you such a long time ? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , ' Show us the Father ' ?
43014010	Don't you believe that I am in the Father , and that the Father is in me ? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority . Rather , it is the Father , living in me , who is doing his work .
43014011	Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves .
43014012	Very truly I tell you , whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing , and they will do even greater things than these , because I am going to the Father .
43014013	And I will do whatever you ask in my name , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
43014014	You may ask me for anything in my name , and I will do it .
43014015	" If you love me , keep my commands .
43014016	And I will ask the Father , and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever —
43014017	the Spirit of truth . The world cannot accept him , because it neither sees him nor knows him . But you know him , for he lives with you and will be in you .
43014018	I will not leave you as orphans ; I will come to you .
43014019	Before long , the world will not see me anymore , but you will see me . Because I live , you also will live .
43014020	On that day you will realize that I am in my Father , and you are in me , and I am in you .
43014021	Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me . The one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I too will love them and show myself to them . "
43014022	Then Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) said , " But , Lord , why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world ? "
43014023	Jesus replied , " Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching . My Father will love them , and we will come to them and make our home with them .
43014024	Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching . These words you hear are not my own ; they belong to the Father who sent me .
43014025	" All this I have spoken while still with you .
43014026	But the Advocate , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you .
43014027	Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give you . I do not give to you as the world gives . Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid .
43014028	" You heard me say , ' I am going away and I am coming back to you . ' If you loved me , you would be glad that I am going to the Father , for the Father is greater than I .
43014029	I have told you now before it happens , so that when it does happen you will believe .
43014030	I will not say much more to you , for the prince of this world is coming . He has no hold over me ,
43014031	but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me . " Come now ; let us leave .
43015001	" I am the true vine , and my Father is the gardener .
43015002	He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit , while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful .
43015003	You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you .
43015004	Remain in me , as I also remain in you . No branch can bear fruit by itself ; it must remain in the vine . Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me .
43015005	" I am the vine ; you are the branches . If you remain in me and I in you , you will bear much fruit ; apart from me you can do nothing .
43015006	If you do not remain in me , you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers ; such branches are picked up , thrown into the fire and burned .
43015007	If you remain in me and my words remain in you , ask whatever you wish , and it will be done for you .
43015008	This is to my Father's glory , that you bear much fruit , showing yourselves to be my disciples .
43015009	" As the Father has loved me , so have I loved you . Now remain in my love .
43015010	If you keep my commands , you will remain in my love , just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in his love .
43015011	I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete .
43015012	My command is this : Love each other as I have loved you .
43015013	Greater love has no one than this : to lay down one's life for one's friends .
43015014	You are my friends if you do what I command .
43015015	I no longer call you servants , because a servant does not know his master's business . Instead , I have called you friends , for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you .
43015016	You did not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit — fruit that will last — and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you .
43015017	This is my command : Love each other .
43015018	" If the world hates you , keep in mind that it hated me first .
43015019	If you belonged to the world , it would love you as its own . As it is , you do not belong to the world , but I have chosen you out of the world . That is why the world hates you .
43015020	Remember what I told you : ' A servant is not greater than his master . ' If they persecuted me , they will persecute you also . If they obeyed my teaching , they will obey yours also .
43015021	They will treat you this way because of my name , for they do not know the one who sent me .
43015022	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
43015023	Whoever hates me hates my Father as well .
43015024	If I had not done among them the works no one else did , they would not be guilty of sin . As it is , they have seen , and yet they have hated both me and my Father .
43015025	But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law : ' They hated me without reason . '
43015026	" When the Advocate comes , whom I will send to you from the Father — the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father — he will testify about me .
43015027	And you also must testify , for you have been with me from the beginning .
43016001	" All this I have told you so that you will not fall away .
43016002	They will put you out of the synagogue ; in fact , the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God .
43016003	They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me .
43016004	I have told you this , so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them . I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you ,
43016005	but now I am going to him who sent me . None of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
43016006	Rather , you are filled with grief because I have said these things .
43016007	But very truly I tell you , it is for your good that I am going away . Unless I go away , the Advocate will not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you .
43016008	When he comes , he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment :
43016009	about sin , because people do not believe in me ;
43016010	about righteousness , because I am going to the Father , where you can see me no longer ;
43016011	and about judgment , because the prince of this world now stands condemned .
43016012	" I have much more to say to you , more than you can now bear .
43016013	But when he , the Spirit of truth , comes , he will guide you into all the truth . He will not speak on his own ; he will speak only what he hears , and he will tell you what is yet to come .
43016014	He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you .
43016015	All that belongs to the Father is mine . That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you . "
43016016	Jesus went on to say , " In a little while you will see me no more , and then after a little while you will see me . "
43016017	At this , some of his disciples said to one another , " What does he mean by saying , ' In a little while you will see me no more , and then after a little while you will see me , ' and ' Because I am going to the Father ' ? "
43016018	They kept asking , " What does he mean by ' a little while ' ? We don't understand what he is saying . "
43016019	Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this , so he said to them , " Are you asking one another what I meant when I said , ' In a little while you will see me no more , and then after a little while you will see me ' ?
43016020	Very truly I tell you , you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices . You will grieve , but your grief will turn to joy .
43016021	A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come ; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world .
43016022	So with you : Now is your time of grief , but I will see you again and you will rejoice , and no one will take away your joy .
43016023	In that day you will no longer ask me anything . Very truly I tell you , my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name .
43016024	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask and you will receive , and your joy will be complete .
43016025	" Though I have been speaking figuratively , a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father .
43016026	In that day you will ask in my name . I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
43016027	No , the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God .
43016028	I came from the Father and entered the world ; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father . "
43016029	Then Jesus' disciples said , " Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech .
43016030	Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions . This makes us believe that you came from God . "
43016031	" Do you now believe ? " Jesus replied .
43016032	" A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered , each to your own home . You will leave me all alone . Yet I am not alone , for my Father is with me .
43016033	" I have told you these things , so that in me you may have peace . In this world you will have trouble . But take heart ! I have overcome the world . "
43017001	After Jesus said this , he looked toward heaven and prayed : " Father , the hour has come . Glorify your Son , that your Son may glorify you .
43017002	For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him .
43017003	Now this is eternal life : that they know you , the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom you have sent .
43017004	I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do .
43017005	And now , Father , glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began .
43017006	" I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world . They were yours ; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word .
43017007	Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you .
43017008	For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them . They knew with certainty that I came from you , and they believed that you sent me .
43017009	I pray for them . I am not praying for the world , but for those you have given me , for they are yours .
43017010	All I have is yours , and all you have is mine . And glory has come to me through them .
43017011	I will remain in the world no longer , but they are still in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , protect them by the power of your name , the name you gave me , so that they may be one as we are one .
43017012	While I was with them , I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me . None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled .
43017013	" I am coming to you now , but I say these things while I am still in the world , so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them .
43017014	I have given them your word and the world has hated them , for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world .
43017015	My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one .
43017016	They are not of the world , even as I am not of it .
43017017	Sanctify them by the truth ; your word is truth .
43017018	As you sent me into the world , I have sent them into the world .
43017019	For them I sanctify myself , that they too may be truly sanctified .
43017020	" My prayer is not for them alone . I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message ,
43017021	that all of them may be one , Father , just as you are in me and I am in you . May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me .
43017022	I have given them the glory that you gave me , that they may be one as we are one —
43017023	I in them and you in me — so that they may be brought to complete unity . Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me .
43017024	" Father , I want those you have given me to be with me where I am , and to see my glory , the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world .
43017025	" Righteous Father , though the world does not know you , I know you , and they know that you have sent me .
43017026	I have made you known to them , and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them . "
43018001	When he had finished praying , Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley . On the other side there was a garden , and he and his disciples went into it .
43018002	Now Judas , who betrayed him , knew the place , because Jesus had often met there with his disciples .
43018003	So Judas came to the garden , guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees . They were carrying torches , lanterns and weapons .
43018004	Jesus , knowing all that was going to happen to him , went out and asked them , " Who is it you want ? "
43018005	" Jesus of Nazareth , " they replied . " I am he , " Jesus said . ( And Judas the traitor was standing there with them . )
43018006	When Jesus said , " I am he , " they drew back and fell to the ground .
43018007	Again he asked them , " Who is it you want ? " " Jesus of Nazareth , " they said .
43018008	Jesus answered , " I told you that I am he . If you are looking for me , then let these men go . "
43018009	This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled : " I have not lost one of those you gave me . "
43018010	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest's servant , cutting off his right ear . ( The servant's name was Malchus . )
43018011	Jesus commanded Peter , " Put your sword away ! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me ? "
43018012	Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus . They bound him
43018013	and brought him first to Annas , who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year .
43018014	Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people .
43018015	Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus . Because this disciple was known to the high priest , he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard ,
43018016	but Peter had to wait outside at the door . The other disciple , who was known to the high priest , came back , spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought Peter in .
43018017	" You aren't one of this man's disciples too , are you ? " she asked Peter . He replied , " I am not . "
43018018	It was cold , and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm . Peter also was standing with them , warming himself .
43018019	Meanwhile , the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching .
43018020	" I have spoken openly to the world , " Jesus replied . " I always taught in synagogues or at the temple , where all the Jews come together . I said nothing in secret .
43018021	Why question me ? Ask those who heard me . Surely they know what I said . "
43018022	When Jesus said this , one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face . " Is this the way you answer the high priest ? " he demanded .
43018023	" If I said something wrong , " Jesus replied , " testify as to what is wrong . But if I spoke the truth , why did you strike me ? "
43018024	Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
43018025	Meanwhile , Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself . So they asked him , " You aren't one of his disciples too , are you ? " He denied it , saying , " I am not . "
43018026	One of the high priest's servants , a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off , challenged him , " Didn't I see you with him in the garden ? "
43018027	Again Peter denied it , and at that moment a rooster began to crow .
43018028	Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor . By now it was early morning , and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace , because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover .
43018029	So Pilate came out to them and asked , " What charges are you bringing against this man ? "
43018030	" If he were not a criminal , " they replied , " we would not have handed him over to you . "
43018031	Pilate said , " Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law . " " But we have no right to execute anyone , " they objected .
43018032	This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die .
43018033	Pilate then went back inside the palace , summoned Jesus and asked him , " Are you the king of the Jews ? "
43018034	" Is that your own idea , " Jesus asked , " or did others talk to you about me ? "
43018035	" Am I a Jew ? " Pilate replied . " Your own people and chief priests handed you over to me . What is it you have done ? "
43018036	Jesus said , " My kingdom is not of this world . If it were , my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders . But now my kingdom is from another place . "
43018037	" You are a king , then ! " said Pilate . Jesus answered , " You say that I am a king . In fact , the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth . Everyone on the side of truth listens to me . "
43018038	" What is truth ? " retorted Pilate . With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said , " I find no basis for a charge against him .
43018039	But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover . Do you want me to release ' the king of the Jews ' ? "
43018040	They shouted back , " No , not him ! Give us Barabbas ! " Now Barabbas had taken part in an uprising .
43019001	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged .
43019002	The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head . They clothed him in a purple robe
43019003	and went up to him again and again , saying , " Hail , king of the Jews ! " And they slapped him in the face .
43019004	Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there , " Look , I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
43019005	When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe , Pilate said to them , " Here is the man ! "
43019006	As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him , they shouted , " Crucify ! Crucify ! " But Pilate answered , " You take him and crucify him . As for me , I find no basis for a charge against him . "
43019007	The Jewish leaders insisted , " We have a law , and according to that law he must die , because he claimed to be the Son of God . "
43019008	When Pilate heard this , he was even more afraid ,
43019009	and he went back inside the palace . " Where do you come from ? " he asked Jesus , but Jesus gave him no answer .
43019010	" Do you refuse to speak to me ? " Pilate said . " Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you ? "
43019011	Jesus answered , " You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above . Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . "
43019012	From then on , Pilate tried to set Jesus free , but the Jewish leaders kept shouting , " If you let this man go , you are no friend of Caesar . Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar . "
43019013	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement ( which in Aramaic is Gabbatha ) .
43019014	It was the day of Preparation of the Passover ; it was about noon . " Here is your king , " Pilate said to the Jews .
43019015	But they shouted , " Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! " " Shall I crucify your king ? " Pilate asked . " We have no king but Caesar , " the chief priests answered .
43019016	Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified . So the soldiers took charge of Jesus .
43019017	Carrying his own cross , he went out to the place of the Skull ( which in Aramaic is called Golgotha ) .
43019018	There they crucified him , and with him two others — one on each side and Jesus in the middle .
43019019	Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross . It read : jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
43019020	Many of the Jews read this sign , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and the sign was written in Aramaic , Latin and Greek .
43019021	The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate , " Do not write ' The King of the Jews , ' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews . "
43019022	Pilate answered , " What I have written , I have written . "
43019023	When the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes , dividing them into four shares , one for each of them , with the undergarment remaining . This garment was seamless , woven in one piece from top to bottom .
43019024	" Let's not tear it , " they said to one another . " Let's decide by lot who will get it . " This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said ,
43019025	Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother , his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
43019026	When Jesus saw his mother there , and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby , he said to her , " Woman , here is your son , "
43019027	and to the disciple , " Here is your mother . " From that time on , this disciple took her into his home .
43019028	Later , knowing that everything had now been finished , and so that Scripture would be fulfilled , Jesus said , " I am thirsty . "
43019029	A jar of wine vinegar was there , so they soaked a sponge in it , put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant , and lifted it to Jesus' lips .
43019030	When he had received the drink , Jesus said , " It is finished . " With that , he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
43019031	Now it was the day of Preparation , and the next day was to be a special Sabbath . Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath , they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down .
43019032	The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus , and then those of the other .
43019033	But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
43019034	Instead , one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear , bringing a sudden flow of blood and water .
43019035	The man who saw it has given testimony , and his testimony is true . He knows that he tells the truth , and he testifies so that you also may believe .
43019036	These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled : " Not one of his bones will be broken , "
43019037	and , as another scripture says , " They will look on the one they have pierced . "
43019038	Later , Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus . Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders . With Pilate's permission , he came and took the body away .
43019039	He was accompanied by Nicodemus , the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night . Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about seventy-five pounds .
43019040	Taking Jesus' body , the two of them wrapped it , with the spices , in strips of linen . This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs .
43019041	At the place where Jesus was crucified , there was a garden , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one had ever been laid .
43019042	Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby , they laid Jesus there .
43020001	Early on the first day of the week , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance .
43020002	So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one Jesus loved , and said , " They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don't know where they have put him ! "
43020003	So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb .
43020004	Both were running , but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first .
43020005	He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in .
43020006	Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb . He saw the strips of linen lying there ,
43020007	as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head . The cloth was still lying in its place , separate from the linen .
43020008	Finally the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , also went inside . He saw and believed .
43020009	( They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead . )
43020010	Then the disciples went back to where they were staying .
43020011	Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying . As she wept , she bent over to look into the tomb
43020012	and saw two angels in white , seated where Jesus' body had been , one at the head and the other at the foot .
43020013	They asked her , " Woman , why are you crying ? " " They have taken my Lord away , " she said , " and I don't know where they have put him . "
43020014	At this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not realize that it was Jesus .
43020015	He asked her , " Woman , why are you crying ? Who is it you are looking for ? " Thinking he was the gardener , she said , " Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have put him , and I will get him . "
43020016	Jesus said to her , " Mary . " She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic , " Rabboni ! " ( which means " Teacher " ) .
43020017	Jesus said , " Do not hold on to me , for I have not yet ascended to the Father . Go instead to my brothers and tell them , ' I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . ' "
43020018	Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news : " I have seen the Lord ! " And she told them that he had said these things to her .
43020019	On the evening of that first day of the week , when the disciples were together , with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders , Jesus came and stood among them and said , " Peace be with you ! "
43020020	After he said this , he showed them his hands and side . The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord .
43020021	Again Jesus said , " Peace be with you ! As the Father has sent me , I am sending you . "
43020022	And with that he breathed on them and said , " Receive the Holy Spirit .
43020023	If you forgive anyone's sins , their sins are forgiven ; if you do not forgive them , they are not forgiven . "
43020024	Now Thomas ( also known as Didymus ) , one of the Twelve , was not with the disciples when Jesus came .
43020025	So the other disciples told him , " We have seen the Lord ! " But he said to them , " Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe . "
43020026	A week later his disciples were in the house again , and Thomas was with them . Though the doors were locked , Jesus came and stood among them and said , " Peace be with you ! "
43020027	Then he said to Thomas , " Put your finger here ; see my hands . Reach out your hand and put it into my side . Stop doubting and believe . "
43020028	Thomas said to him , " My Lord and my God ! "
43020029	Then Jesus told him , " Because you have seen me , you have believed ; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed . "
43020030	Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples , which are not recorded in this book .
43020031	But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah , the Son of God , and that by believing you may have life in his name .
43021001	Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples , by the Sea of Galilee . It happened this way :
43021002	Simon Peter , Thomas ( also known as Didymus ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the sons of Zebedee , and two other disciples were together .
43021003	" I'm going out to fish , " Simon Peter told them , and they said , " We'll go with you . " So they went out and got into the boat , but that night they caught nothing .
43021004	Early in the morning , Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus .
43021005	He called out to them , " Friends , haven't you any fish ? " " No , " they answered .
43021006	He said , " Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some . " When they did , they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish .
43021007	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , " It is the Lord ! " As soon as Simon Peter heard him say , " It is the Lord , " he wrapped his outer garment around him ( for he had taken it off ) and jumped into the water .
43021008	The other disciples followed in the boat , towing the net full of fish , for they were not far from shore , about a hundred yards .
43021009	When they landed , they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it , and some bread .
43021010	Jesus said to them , " Bring some of the fish you have just caught . "
43021011	So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore . It was full of large fish , 153 , but even with so many the net was not torn .
43021012	Jesus said to them , " Come and have breakfast . " None of the disciples dared ask him , " Who are you ? " They knew it was the Lord .
43021013	Jesus came , took the bread and gave it to them , and did the same with the fish .
43021014	This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead .
43021015	When they had finished eating , Jesus said to Simon Peter , " Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? " " Yes , Lord , " he said , " you know that I love you . " Jesus said , " Feed my lambs . "
43021016	Again Jesus said , " Simon son of John , do you love me ? " He answered , " Yes , Lord , you know that I love you . " Jesus said , " Take care of my sheep . "
43021017	The third time he said to him , " Simon son of John , do you love me ? " Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time , " Do you love me ? " He said , " Lord , you know all things ; you know that I love you . " Jesus said , " Feed my sheep .
43021018	Very truly I tell you , when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted ; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go . "
43021019	Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God . Then he said to him , " Follow me ! "
43021020	Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them . ( This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said , " Lord , who is going to betray you ? " )
43021021	When Peter saw him , he asked , " Lord , what about him ? "
43021022	Jesus answered , " If I want him to remain alive until I return , what is that to you ? You must follow me . "
43021023	Because of this , the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say that he would not die ; he only said , " If I want him to remain alive until I return , what is that to you ? "
43021024	This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down . We know that his testimony is true .
43021025	Jesus did many other things as well . If every one of them were written down , I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written .
45001001	Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God —
45001002	the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
45001003	regarding his Son , who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David ,
45001004	and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead : Jesus Christ our Lord .
45001005	Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name's sake .
45001006	And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ .
45001007	To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people : Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
45001008	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is being reported all over the world .
45001009	God , whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son , is my witness how constantly I remember you
45001010	in my prayers at all times ; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you .
45001011	I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong —
45001012	that is , that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith .
45001013	I do not want you to be unaware , brothers and sisters , that I planned many times to come to you ( but have been prevented from doing so until now ) in order that I might have a harvest among you , just as I have had among the other Gentiles .
45001014	I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks , both to the wise and the foolish .
45001015	That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome .
45001016	For I am not ashamed of the gospel , because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes : first to the Jew , then to the Gentile .
45001017	For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed — a righteousness that is by faith from first to last , just as it is written : " The righteous will live by faith . "
45001018	The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people , who suppress the truth by their wickedness ,
45001019	since what may be known about God is plain to them , because God has made it plain to them .
45001020	For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities — his eternal power and divine nature — have been clearly seen , being understood from what has been made , so that people are without excuse .
45001021	For although they knew God , they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him , but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened .
45001022	Although they claimed to be wise , they became fools
45001023	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles .
45001024	Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another .
45001025	They exchanged the truth about God for a lie , and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator — who is forever praised . Amen .
45001026	Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones .
45001027	In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . Men committed shameful acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their error .
45001028	Furthermore , just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God , so God gave them over to a depraved mind , so that they do what ought not to be done .
45001029	They have become filled with every kind of wickedness , evil , greed and depravity . They are full of envy , murder , strife , deceit and malice . They are gossips ,
45001030	slanderers , God-haters , insolent , arrogant and boastful ; they invent ways of doing evil ; they disobey their parents ;
45001031	they have no understanding , no fidelity , no love , no mercy .
45001032	Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death , they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them .
45002001	You , therefore , have no excuse , you who pass judgment on someone else , for at whatever point you judge another , you are condemning yourself , because you who pass judgment do the same things .
45002002	Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth .
45002003	So when you , a mere human being , pass judgment on them and yet do the same things , do you think you will escape God's judgment ?
45002004	Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness , forbearance and patience , not realizing that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance ?
45002005	But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart , you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath , when his righteous judgment will be revealed .
45002006	God " will repay each person according to what they have done . "
45002007	To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory , honor and immortality , he will give eternal life .
45002008	But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil , there will be wrath and anger .
45002009	There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil : first for the Jew , then for the Gentile ;
45002010	but glory , honor and peace for everyone who does good : first for the Jew , then for the Gentile .
45002011	For God does not show favoritism .
45002012	All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law , and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law .
45002013	For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight , but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous .
45002014	( Indeed , when Gentiles , who do not have the law , do by nature things required by the law , they are a law for themselves , even though they do not have the law .
45002015	They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts , their consciences also bearing witness , and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them . )
45002016	This will take place on the day when God judges people's secrets through Jesus Christ , as my gospel declares .
45002017	Now you , if you call yourself a Jew ; if you rely on the law and boast in God ;
45002018	if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law ;
45002019	if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind , a light for those who are in the dark ,
45002020	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of little children , because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth —
45002021	you , then , who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , do you steal ?
45002022	You who say that people should not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
45002023	You who boast in the law , do you dishonor God by breaking the law ?
45002024	As it is written : " God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you . "
45002025	Circumcision has value if you observe the law , but if you break the law , you have become as though you had not been circumcised .
45002026	So then , if those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements , will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised ?
45002027	The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who , even though you have the written code and circumcision , are a lawbreaker .
45002028	A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly , nor is circumcision merely outward and physical .
45002029	No , a person is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart , by the Spirit , not by the written code . Such a person's praise is not from other people , but from God .
45003001	What advantage , then , is there in being a Jew , or what value is there in circumcision ?
45003002	Much in every way ! First of all , the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God .
45003003	What if some were unfaithful ? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God's faithfulness ?
45003004	Not at all ! Let God be true , and every human being a liar . As it is written :
45003006	Certainly not ! If that were so , how could God judge the world ?
45003007	Someone might argue , " If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory , why am I still condemned as a sinner ? "
45003008	Why not say — as some slanderously claim that we say — " Let us do evil that good may result " ? Their condemnation is just !
45003009	What shall we conclude then ? Do we have any advantage ? Not at all ! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin .
45003010	As it is written :
45003012	All have turned away ,
45003013	" Their throats are open graves ;
45003014	" Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness . "
45003015	" Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
45003016	ruin and misery mark their ways ,
45003017	and the way of peace they do not know . "
45003018	" There is no fear of God before their eyes . "
45003019	Now we know that whatever the law says , it says to those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God .
45003020	Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law ; rather , through the law we become conscious of our sin .
45003021	But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known , to which the Law and the Prophets testify .
45003022	This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe . There is no difference between Jew and Gentile ,
45003023	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
45003024	and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus .
45003025	God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement , through the shedding of his blood — to be received by faith . He did this to demonstrate his righteousness , because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished —
45003026	he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time , so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus .
45003027	Where , then , is boasting ? It is excluded . Because of what law ? The law that requires works ? No , because of the law that requires faith .
45003028	For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law .
45003029	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Is he not the God of Gentiles too ? Yes , of Gentiles too ,
45003030	since there is only one God , who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith .
45003031	Do we , then , nullify the law by this faith ? Not at all ! Rather , we uphold the law .
45004001	What then shall we say that Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh , discovered in this matter ?
45004002	If , in fact , Abraham was justified by works , he had something to boast about — but not before God .
45004003	What does Scripture say ? " Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . "
45004004	Now to the one who works , wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation .
45004005	However , to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly , their faith is credited as righteousness .
45004006	David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
45004007	" Blessed are those
45004008	Blessed is the one
45004009	Is this blessedness only for the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness .
45004010	Under what circumstances was it credited ? Was it after he was circumcised , or before ? It was not after , but before !
45004011	And he received circumcision as a sign , a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised . So then , he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised , in order that righteousness might be credited to them .
45004012	And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
45004013	It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world , but through the righteousness that comes by faith .
45004014	For if those who depend on the law are heirs , faith means nothing and the promise is worthless ,
45004015	because the law brings wrath . And where there is no law there is no transgression .
45004016	Therefore , the promise comes by faith , so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring — not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham . He is the father of us all .
45004017	As it is written : " I have made you a father of many nations . " He is our father in the sight of God , in whom he believed — the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not .
45004018	Against all hope , Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations , just as it had been said to him , " So shall your offspring be . "
45004019	Without weakening in his faith , he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead — since he was about a hundred years old — and that Sarah's womb was also dead .
45004020	Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God , but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God ,
45004021	being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised .
45004022	This is why " it was credited to him as righteousness . "
45004023	The words " it was credited to him " were written not for him alone ,
45004024	but also for us , to whom God will credit righteousness — for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
45004025	He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification .
45005001	Therefore , since we have been justified through faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
45005002	through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand . And we boast in the hope of the glory of God .
45005003	Not only so , but we also glory in our sufferings , because we know that suffering produces perseverance ;
45005004	perseverance , character ; and character , hope .
45005005	And hope does not put us to shame , because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit , who has been given to us .
45005006	You see , at just the right time , when we were still powerless , Christ died for the ungodly .
45005007	Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person , though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die .
45005008	But God demonstrates his own love for us in this : While we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
45005009	Since we have now been justified by his blood , how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him !
45005010	For if , while we were God's enemies , we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son , how much more , having been reconciled , shall we be saved through his life !
45005011	Not only is this so , but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received reconciliation .
45005012	Therefore , just as sin entered the world through one man , and death through sin , and in this way death came to all people , because all sinned —
45005013	To be sure , sin was in the world before the law was given , but sin is not charged against anyone's account where there is no law .
45005014	Nevertheless , death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , even over those who did not sin by breaking a command , as did Adam , who is a pattern of the one to come .
45005015	But the gift is not like the trespass . For if the many died by the trespass of the one man , how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , overflow to the many !
45005016	Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man's sin : The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation , but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification .
45005017	For if , by the trespass of the one man , death reigned through that one man , how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man , Jesus Christ !
45005018	Consequently , just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people , so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people .
45005019	For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous .
45005020	The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase . But where sin increased , grace increased all the more ,
45005021	so that , just as sin reigned in death , so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	What shall we say , then ? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase ?
45006002	By no means ! We are those who have died to sin ; how can we live in it any longer ?
45006003	Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
45006004	We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that , just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , we too may live a new life .
45006005	For if we have been united with him in a death like his , we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his .
45006006	For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with , that we should no longer be slaves to sin —
45006007	because anyone who has died has been set free from sin .
45006008	Now if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
45006009	For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead , he cannot die again ; death no longer has mastery over him .
45006010	The death he died , he died to sin once for all ; but the life he lives , he lives to God .
45006011	In the same way , count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
45006012	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires .
45006013	Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness , but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life ; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness .
45006014	For sin shall no longer be your master , because you are not under the law , but under grace .
45006015	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace ? By no means !
45006016	Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , you are slaves of the one you obey — whether you are slaves to sin , which leads to death , or to obedience , which leads to righteousness ?
45006017	But thanks be to God that , though you used to be slaves to sin , you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance .
45006018	You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness .
45006019	I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations . Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness , so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness .
45006020	When you were slaves to sin , you were free from the control of righteousness .
45006021	What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of ? Those things result in death !
45006022	But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God , the benefit you reap leads to holiness , and the result is eternal life .
45006023	For the wages of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45007001	Do you not know , brothers and sisters — for I am speaking to those who know the law — that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives ?
45007002	For example , by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive , but if her husband dies , she is released from the law that binds her to him .
45007003	So then , if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive , she is called an adulteress . But if her husband dies , she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man .
45007004	So , my brothers and sisters , you also died to the law through the body of Christ , that you might belong to another , to him who was raised from the dead , in order that we might bear fruit for God .
45007005	For when we were in the realm of the flesh , the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us , so that we bore fruit for death .
45007006	But now , by dying to what once bound us , we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit , and not in the old way of the written code .
45007007	What shall we say , then ? Is the law sinful ? Certainly not ! Nevertheless , I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law . For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said , " You shall not covet . "
45007008	But sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , produced in me every kind of coveting . For apart from the law , sin was dead .
45007009	Once I was alive apart from the law ; but when the commandment came , sin sprang to life and I died .
45007010	I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death .
45007011	For sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , deceived me , and through the commandment put me to death .
45007012	So then , the law is holy , and the commandment is holy , righteous and good .
45007013	Did that which is good , then , become death to me ? By no means ! Nevertheless , in order that sin might be recognized as sin , it used what is good to bring about my death , so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful .
45007014	We know that the law is spiritual ; but I am unspiritual , sold as a slave to sin .
45007015	I do not understand what I do . For what I want to do I do not do , but what I hate I do .
45007016	And if I do what I do not want to do , I agree that the law is good .
45007017	As it is , it is no longer I myself who do it , but it is sin living in me .
45007018	For I know that good itself does not dwell in me , that is , in my sinful nature . For I have the desire to do what is good , but I cannot carry it out .
45007019	For I do not do the good I want to do , but the evil I do not want to do — this I keep on doing .
45007020	Now if I do what I do not want to do , it is no longer I who do it , but it is sin living in me that does it .
45007021	So I find this law at work : Although I want to do good , evil is right there with me .
45007022	For in my inner being I delight in God's law ;
45007023	but I see another law at work in me , waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me .
45007024	What a wretched man I am ! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death ?
45007025	Thanks be to God , who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law , but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin .
45008001	Therefore , there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus ,
45008002	because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death .
45008003	For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh , God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering . And so he condemned sin in the flesh ,
45008004	in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us , who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
45008005	Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires ; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires .
45008006	The mind governed by the flesh is death , but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace .
45008007	The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God ; it does not submit to God's law , nor can it do so .
45008008	Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God .
45008009	You , however , are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you . And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , they do not belong to Christ .
45008010	But if Christ is in you , then even though your body is subject to death because of sin , the Spirit gives life because of righteousness .
45008011	And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you , he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you .
45008012	Therefore , brothers and sisters , we have an obligation — but it is not to the flesh , to live according to it .
45008013	For if you live according to the flesh , you will die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body , you will live .
45008014	For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God .
45008015	The Spirit you received does not make you slaves , so that you live in fear again ; rather , the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship . And by him we cry , " Abba , Father . "
45008016	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children .
45008017	Now if we are children , then we are heirs — heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ , if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory .
45008018	I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us .
45008019	For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed .
45008020	For the creation was subjected to frustration , not by its own choice , but by the will of the one who subjected it , in hope
45008021	that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God .
45008022	We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time .
45008023	Not only so , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship , the redemption of our bodies .
45008024	For in this hope we were saved . But hope that is seen is no hope at all . Who hopes for what they already have ?
45008025	But if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently .
45008026	In the same way , the Spirit helps us in our weakness . We do not know what we ought to pray for , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans .
45008027	And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God .
45008028	And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him , who have been called according to his purpose .
45008029	For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters .
45008030	And those he predestined , he also called ; those he called , he also justified ; those he justified , he also glorified .
45008031	What , then , shall we say in response to these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	He who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all — how will he not also , along with him , graciously give us all things ?
45008033	Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen ? It is God who justifies .
45008034	Who then is the one who condemns ? No one . Christ Jesus who died — more than that , who was raised to life — is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us .
45008035	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword ?
45008036	As it is written :
45008038	For I am convinced that neither death nor life , neither angels nor demons , neither the present nor the future , nor any powers ,
45008039	neither height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
45009001	I speak the truth in Christ — I am not lying , my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit —
45009002	I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart .
45009003	For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people , those of my own race ,
45009004	the people of Israel . Theirs is the adoption to sonship ; theirs the divine glory , the covenants , the receiving of the law , the temple worship and the promises .
45009005	Theirs are the patriarchs , and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah , who is God over all , forever praised ! Amen .
45009006	It is not as though God's word had failed . For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel .
45009007	Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children . On the contrary , " It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned . "
45009008	In other words , it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children , but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring .
45009009	For this was how the promise was stated : " At the appointed time I will return , and Sarah will have a son . "
45009010	Not only that , but Rebekah's children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac .
45009011	Yet , before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad — in order that God's purpose in election might stand :
45009012	not by works but by him who calls — she was told , " The older will serve the younger . "
45009013	Just as it is written : " Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . "
45009014	What then shall we say ? Is God unjust ? Not at all !
45009015	For he says to Moses ,
45009017	For Scripture says to Pharaoh : " I raised you up for this very purpose , that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . "
45009018	Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy , and he hardens whom he wants to harden .
45009019	One of you will say to me : " Then why does God still blame us ? For who is able to resist his will ? "
45009020	But who are you , a human being , to talk back to God ? " Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it , ' Why did you make me like this ? ' "
45009021	Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use ?
45009022	What if God , although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known , bore with great patience the objects of his wrath — prepared for destruction ?
45009023	What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy , whom he prepared in advance for glory —
45009024	even us , whom he also called , not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles ?
45009025	As he says in Hosea :
45009027	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel :
45009028	For the Lord will carry out
45009029	It is just as Isaiah said previously :
45009030	What then shall we say ? That the Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , have obtained it , a righteousness that is by faith ;
45009031	but the people of Israel , who pursued the law as the way of righteousness , have not attained their goal .
45009032	Why not ? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works . They stumbled over the stumbling stone .
45009033	As it is written :
45010001	Brothers and sisters , my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved .
45010002	For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God , but their zeal is not based on knowledge .
45010003	Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own , they did not submit to God's righteousness .
45010004	Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes .
45010005	Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law : " The person who does these things will live by them . "
45010006	But the righteousness that is by faith says : " Do not say in your heart , ' Who will ascend into heaven ? ' " ( that is , to bring Christ down )
45010007	" or ' Who will descend into the deep ? ' " ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
45010008	But what does it say ? " The word is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart , " that is , the message concerning faith that we proclaim :
45010009	If you declare with your mouth , " Jesus is Lord , " and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
45010010	For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified , and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved .
45010011	As Scripture says , " Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame . "
45010012	For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile — the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him ,
45010013	for , " Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . "
45010014	How , then , can they call on the one they have not believed in ? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard ? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them ?
45010015	And how can anyone preach unless they are sent ? As it is written : " How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news ! "
45010016	But not all the Israelites accepted the good news . For Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our message ? "
45010017	Consequently , faith comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word about Christ .
45010018	But I ask : Did they not hear ? Of course they did :
45010020	And Isaiah boldly says ,
45010021	But concerning Israel he says ,
45011001	I ask then : Did God reject his people ? By no means ! I am an Israelite myself , a descendant of Abraham , from the tribe of Benjamin .
45011002	God did not reject his people , whom he foreknew . Don't you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah — how he appealed to God against Israel :
45011003	" Lord , they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars ; I am the only one left , and they are trying to kill me " ?
45011004	And what was God's answer to him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal . "
45011005	So too , at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace .
45011006	And if by grace , then it cannot be based on works ; if it were , grace would no longer be grace .
45011007	What then ? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain . The elect among them did , but the others were hardened ,
45011008	as it is written :
45011010	May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see ,
45011011	Again I ask : Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery ? Not at all ! Rather , because of their transgression , salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious .
45011012	But if their transgression means riches for the world , and their loss means riches for the Gentiles , how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring !
45011013	I am talking to you Gentiles . Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles , I take pride in my ministry
45011014	in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them .
45011015	For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
45011016	If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy , then the whole batch is holy ; if the root is holy , so are the branches .
45011017	If some of the branches have been broken off , and you , though a wild olive shoot , have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root ,
45011018	do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches . If you do , consider this : You do not support the root , but the root supports you .
45011019	You will say then , " Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in . "
45011020	Granted . But they were broken off because of unbelief , and you stand by faith . Do not be arrogant , but tremble .
45011021	For if God did not spare the natural branches , he will not spare you either .
45011022	Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God : sternness to those who fell , but kindness to you , provided that you continue in his kindness . Otherwise , you also will be cut off .
45011023	And if they do not persist in unbelief , they will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again .
45011024	After all , if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature , and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much more readily will these , the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree !
45011025	I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery , brothers and sisters , so that you may not be conceited : Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in ,
45011026	and in this way all Israel will be saved . As it is written :
45011028	As far as the gospel is concerned , they are enemies for your sake ; but as far as election is concerned , they are loved on account of the patriarchs ,
45011029	for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable .
45011030	Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience ,
45011031	so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you .
45011032	For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all .
45011033	Oh , the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God !
45011035	" Who has ever given to God ,
45011036	For from him and through him and for him are all things .
45012001	Therefore , I urge you , brothers and sisters , in view of God's mercy , to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and pleasing to God — this is your true and proper worship .
45012002	Do not conform to the pattern of this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind . Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is — his good , pleasing and perfect will .
45012003	For by the grace given me I say to every one of you : Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought , but rather think of yourself with sober judgment , in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you .
45012004	For just as each of us has one body with many members , and these members do not all have the same function ,
45012005	so in Christ we , though many , form one body , and each member belongs to all the others .
45012006	We have different gifts , according to the grace given to each of us . If your gift is prophesying , then prophesy in accordance with your faith ;
45012007	if it is serving , then serve ; if it is teaching , then teach ;
45012008	if it is to encourage , then give encouragement ; if it is giving , then give generously ; if it is to lead , do it diligently ; if it is to show mercy , do it cheerfully .
45012009	Love must be sincere . Hate what is evil ; cling to what is good .
45012010	Be devoted to one another in love . Honor one another above yourselves .
45012011	Never be lacking in zeal , but keep your spiritual fervor , serving the Lord .
45012012	Be joyful in hope , patient in affliction , faithful in prayer .
45012013	Share with the Lord's people who are in need . Practice hospitality .
45012014	Bless those who persecute you ; bless and do not curse .
45012015	Rejoice with those who rejoice ; mourn with those who mourn .
45012016	Live in harmony with one another . Do not be proud , but be willing to associate with people of low position . Do not be conceited .
45012017	Do not repay anyone evil for evil . Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone .
45012018	If it is possible , as far as it depends on you , live at peace with everyone .
45012019	Do not take revenge , my dear friends , but leave room for God's wrath , for it is written : " It is mine to avenge ; I will repay , " says the Lord .
45012020	On the contrary :
45013001	Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities , for there is no authority except that which God has established . The authorities that exist have been established by God .
45013002	Consequently , whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted , and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves .
45013003	For rulers hold no terror for those who do right , but for those who do wrong . Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority ? Then do what is right and you will be commended .
45013004	For the one in authority is God's servant for your good . But if you do wrong , be afraid , for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason . They are God's servants , agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer .
45013005	Therefore , it is necessary to submit to the authorities , not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience .
45013006	This is also why you pay taxes , for the authorities are God's servants , who give their full time to governing .
45013007	Give to everyone what you owe them : If you owe taxes , pay taxes ; if revenue , then revenue ; if respect , then respect ; if honor , then honor .
45013008	Let no debt remain outstanding , except the continuing debt to love one another , for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law .
45013009	The commandments , " You shall not commit adultery , " " You shall not murder , " " You shall not steal , " " You shall not covet , " and whatever other command there may be , are summed up in this one command : " Love your neighbor as yourself . "
45013010	Love does no harm to a neighbor . Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law .
45013011	And do this , understanding the present time : The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber , because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed .
45013012	The night is nearly over ; the day is almost here . So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light .
45013013	Let us behave decently , as in the daytime , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and debauchery , not in dissension and jealousy .
45013014	Rather , clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ , and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh .
45014001	Accept the one whose faith is weak , without quarreling over disputable matters .
45014002	One person's faith allows them to eat anything , but another , whose faith is weak , eats only vegetables .
45014003	The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not , and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does , for God has accepted them .
45014004	Who are you to judge someone else's servant ? To their own master , servants stand or fall . And they will stand , for the Lord is able to make them stand .
45014005	One person considers one day more sacred than another ; another considers every day alike . Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind .
45014006	Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord . Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord , for they give thanks to God ; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God .
45014007	For none of us lives for ourselves alone , and none of us dies for ourselves alone .
45014008	If we live , we live for the Lord ; and if we die , we die for the Lord . So , whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord .
45014009	For this very reason , Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living .
45014010	You , then , why do you judge your brother or sister ? Or why do you treat them with contempt ? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat .
45014011	It is written :
45014013	Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another . Instead , make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister .
45014014	I am convinced , being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean in itself . But if anyone regards something as unclean , then for that person it is unclean .
45014015	If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat , you are no longer acting in love . Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died .
45014016	Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil .
45014017	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking , but of righteousness , peace and joy in the Holy Spirit ,
45014018	because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval .
45014019	Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification .
45014020	Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food . All food is clean , but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble .
45014021	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall .
45014022	So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God . Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves .
45014023	But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat , because their eating is not from faith ; and everything that does not come from faith is sin .
45015001	We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves .
45015002	Each of us should please our neighbors for their good , to build them up .
45015003	For even Christ did not please himself but , as it is written : " The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me . "
45015004	For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us , so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope .
45015005	May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had ,
45015006	so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
45015007	Accept one another , then , just as Christ accepted you , in order to bring praise to God .
45015008	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God's truth , so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed
45015009	and , moreover , that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . As it is written :
45015011	And again ,
45015012	And again , Isaiah says ,
45015013	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him , so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit .
45015014	I myself am convinced , my brothers and sisters , that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another .
45015015	Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again , because of the grace God gave me
45015016	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God , so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
45015017	Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God .
45015018	I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done —
45015019	by the power of signs and wonders , through the power of the Spirit of God . So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum , I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ .
45015020	It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known , so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation .
45015021	Rather , as it is written :
45015023	But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions , and since I have been longing for many years to visit you ,
45015024	I plan to do so when I go to Spain . I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there , after I have enjoyed your company for a while .
45015025	Now , however , I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord's people there .
45015026	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord's people in Jerusalem .
45015027	They were pleased to do it , and indeed they owe it to them . For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings , they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings .
45015028	So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution , I will go to Spain and visit you on the way .
45015029	I know that when I come to you , I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ .
45015030	I urge you , brothers and sisters , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me .
45015031	Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord's people there ,
45015032	so that I may come to you with joy , by God's will , and in your company be refreshed .
45015033	The God of peace be with you all . Amen .
45016001	I commend to you our sister Phoebe , a deacon of the church in Cenchreae .
45016002	I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you , for she has been the benefactor of many people , including me .
45016003	Greet Priscilla and Aquila , my co-workers in Christ Jesus .
45016004	They risked their lives for me . Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them .
45016005	Greet also the church that meets at their house . Greet my dear friend Epenetus , who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia .
45016006	Greet Mary , who worked very hard for you .
45016007	Greet Andronicus and Junia , my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me . They are outstanding among the apostles , and they were in Christ before I was .
45016008	Greet Ampliatus , my dear friend in the Lord .
45016009	Greet Urbanus , our co-worker in Christ , and my dear friend Stachys .
45016010	Greet Apelles , whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test . Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus .
45016011	Greet Herodion , my fellow Jew . Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord .
45016012	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa , those women who work hard in the Lord . Greet my dear friend Persis , another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord .
45016013	Greet Rufus , chosen in the Lord , and his mother , who has been a mother to me , too .
45016014	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas and the other brothers and sisters with them .
45016015	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas and all the Lord's people who are with them .
45016016	Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ send greetings .
45016017	I urge you , brothers and sisters , to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned . Keep away from them .
45016018	For such people are not serving our Lord Christ , but their own appetites . By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people .
45016019	Everyone has heard about your obedience , so I rejoice because of you ; but I want you to be wise about what is good , and innocent about what is evil .
45016020	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you .
45016021	Timothy , my co-worker , sends his greetings to you , as do Lucius , Jason and Sosipater , my fellow Jews .
45016022	I , Tertius , who wrote down this letter , greet you in the Lord .
45016023	Gaius , whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy , sends you his greetings . Erastus , who is the city's director of public works , and our brother Quartus send you their greetings .
45016025	Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel , the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ , in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past ,
45016026	but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God , so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith —
45016027	to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ ! Amen .
46001001	Paul , called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and our brother Sosthenes ,
46001002	To the church of God in Corinth , to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people , together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ — their Lord and ours :
46001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
46001004	I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus .
46001005	For in him you have been enriched in every way — with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge —
46001006	God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you .
46001007	Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed .
46001008	He will also keep you firm to the end , so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
46001009	God is faithful , who has called you into fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
46001010	I appeal to you , brothers and sisters , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought .
46001011	My brothers and sisters , some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you .
46001012	What I mean is this : One of you says , " I follow Paul " ; another , " I follow Apollos " ; another , " I follow Cephas " ; still another , " I follow Christ . "
46001013	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
46001014	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
46001015	so no one can say that you were baptized in my name .
46001016	( Yes , I also baptized the household of Stephanas ; beyond that , I don't remember if I baptized anyone else . )
46001017	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the gospel — not with wisdom and eloquence , lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power .
46001018	For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
46001019	For it is written :
46001021	For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him , God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe .
46001022	Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom ,
46001023	but we preach Christ crucified : a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles ,
46001024	but to those whom God has called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God .
46001025	For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
46001026	Brothers and sisters , think of what you were when you were called . Not many of you were wise by human standards ; not many were influential ; not many were of noble birth .
46001027	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise ; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
46001028	God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things — and the things that are not — to nullify the things that are ,
46001029	so that no one may boast before him .
46001030	It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus , who has become for us wisdom from God — that is , our righteousness , holiness and redemption .
46001031	Therefore , as it is written : " Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord . "
46002001	And so it was with me , brothers and sisters . When I came to you , I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God .
46002002	For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified .
46002003	I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling .
46002004	My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words , but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power ,
46002005	so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom , but on God's power .
46002006	We do , however , speak a message of wisdom among the mature , but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age , who are coming to nothing .
46002007	No , we declare God's wisdom , a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began .
46002008	None of the rulers of this age understood it , for if they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
46002009	However , as it is written :
46002011	For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them ? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
46002012	What we have received is not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may understand what God has freely given us .
46002013	This is what we speak , not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit , explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words .
46002014	The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness , and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit .
46002015	The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things , but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments ,
46002016	for , " Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him ? " But we have the mind of Christ .
46003001	Brothers and sisters , I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly — mere infants in Christ .
46003002	I gave you milk , not solid food , for you were not yet ready for it . Indeed , you are still not ready .
46003003	You are still worldly . For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you , are you not worldly ? Are you not acting like mere humans ?
46003004	For when one says , " I follow Paul , " and another , " I follow Apollos , " are you not mere human beings ?
46003005	What , after all , is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? Only servants , through whom you came to believe — as the Lord has assigned to each his task .
46003006	I planted the seed , Apollos watered it , but God has been making it grow .
46003007	So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but only God , who makes things grow .
46003008	The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose , and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor .
46003009	For we are co-workers in God's service ; you are God's field , God's building .
46003010	By the grace God has given me , I laid a foundation as a wise builder , and someone else is building on it . But each one should build with care .
46003011	For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid , which is Jesus Christ .
46003012	If anyone builds on this foundation using gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay or straw ,
46003013	their work will be shown for what it is , because the Day will bring it to light . It will be revealed with fire , and the fire will test the quality of each person's work .
46003014	If what has been built survives , the builder will receive a reward .
46003015	If it is burned up , the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved — even though only as one escaping through the flames .
46003016	Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst ?
46003017	If anyone destroys God's temple , God will destroy that person ; for God's temple is sacred , and you together are that temple .
46003018	Do not deceive yourselves . If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age , you should become " fools " so that you may become wise .
46003019	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight . As it is written : " He catches the wise in their craftiness " ;
46003020	and again , " The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile . "
46003021	So then , no more boasting about human leaders ! All things are yours ,
46003022	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future — all are yours ,
46003023	and you are of Christ , and Christ is of God .
46004001	This , then , is how you ought to regard us : as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed .
46004002	Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful .
46004003	I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court ; indeed , I do not even judge myself .
46004004	My conscience is clear , but that does not make me innocent . It is the Lord who judges me .
46004005	Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time ; wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart . At that time each will receive their praise from God .
46004006	Now , brothers and sisters , I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit , so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying , " Do not go beyond what is written . " Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other .
46004007	For who makes you different from anyone else ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as though you did not ?
46004008	Already you have all you want ! Already you have become rich ! You have begun to reign — and that without us ! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you !
46004009	For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession , like those condemned to die in the arena . We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe , to angels as well as to human beings .
46004010	We are fools for Christ , but you are so wise in Christ ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are honored , we are dishonored !
46004011	To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty , we are in rags , we are brutally treated , we are homeless .
46004012	We work hard with our own hands . When we are cursed , we bless ; when we are persecuted , we endure it ;
46004013	when we are slandered , we answer kindly . We have become the scum of the earth , the garbage of the world — right up to this moment .
46004014	I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children .
46004015	Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ , you do not have many fathers , for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel .
46004016	Therefore I urge you to imitate me .
46004017	For this reason I have sent to you Timothy , my son whom I love , who is faithful in the Lord . He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus , which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church .
46004018	Some of you have become arrogant , as if I were not coming to you .
46004019	But I will come to you very soon , if the Lord is willing , and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking , but what power they have .
46004020	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power .
46004021	What do you prefer ? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline , or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit ?
46005001	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate : A man is sleeping with his father's wife .
46005002	And you are proud ! Shouldn't you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this ?
46005003	For my part , even though I am not physically present , I am with you in spirit . As one who is present with you in this way , I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this .
46005004	So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit , and the power of our Lord Jesus is present ,
46005005	hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord .
46005006	Your boasting is not good . Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough ?
46005007	Get rid of the old yeast , so that you may be a new unleavened batch — as you really are . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed .
46005008	Therefore let us keep the Festival , not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
46005009	I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people —
46005010	not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral , or the greedy and swindlers , or idolaters . In that case you would have to leave this world .
46005011	But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy , an idolater or slanderer , a drunkard or swindler . Do not even eat with such people .
46005012	What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church ? Are you not to judge those inside ?
46005013	God will judge those outside . " Expel the wicked person from among you . "
46006001	If any of you has a dispute with another , do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people ?
46006002	Or do you not know that the Lord's people will judge the world ? And if you are to judge the world , are you not competent to judge trivial cases ?
46006003	Do you not know that we will judge angels ? How much more the things of this life !
46006004	Therefore , if you have disputes about such matters , do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church ?
46006005	I say this to shame you . Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers ?
46006006	But instead , one brother takes another to court — and this in front of unbelievers !
46006007	The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ?
46006008	Instead , you yourselves cheat and do wrong , and you do this to your brothers and sisters .
46006009	Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived : Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men
46006010	nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
46006011	And that is what some of you were . But you were washed , you were sanctified , you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God .
46006012	" I have the right to do anything , " you say — but not everything is beneficial . " I have the right to do anything " — but I will not be mastered by anything .
46006013	You say , " Food for the stomach and the stomach for food , and God will destroy them both . " The body , however , is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
46006014	By his power God raised the Lord from the dead , and he will raise us also .
46006015	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute ? Never !
46006016	Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body ? For it is said , " The two will become one flesh . "
46006017	But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit .
46006018	Flee from sexual immorality . All other sins a person commits are outside the body , but whoever sins sexually , sins against their own body .
46006019	Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit , who is in you , whom you have received from God ? You are not your own ;
46006020	you were bought at a price . Therefore honor God with your bodies .
46007001	Now for the matters you wrote about : " It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman . "
46007002	But since sexual immorality is occurring , each man should have sexual relations with his own wife , and each woman with her own husband .
46007003	The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife , and likewise the wife to her husband .
46007004	The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband . In the same way , the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife .
46007005	Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer . Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
46007006	I say this as a concession , not as a command .
46007007	I wish that all of you were as I am . But each of you has your own gift from God ; one has this gift , another has that .
46007008	Now to the unmarried and the widows I say : It is good for them to stay unmarried , as I do .
46007009	But if they cannot control themselves , they should marry , for it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
46007010	To the married I give this command ( not I , but the Lord ) : A wife must not separate from her husband .
46007011	But if she does , she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband . And a husband must not divorce his wife .
46007012	To the rest I say this ( I , not the Lord ) : If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him , he must not divorce her .
46007013	And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her , she must not divorce him .
46007014	For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife , and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but as it is , they are holy .
46007015	But if the unbeliever leaves , let it be so . The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances ; God has called us to live in peace .
46007016	How do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or , how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
46007017	Nevertheless , each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them , just as God has called them . This is the rule I lay down in all the churches .
46007018	Was a man already circumcised when he was called ? He should not become uncircumcised . Was a man uncircumcised when he was called ? He should not be circumcised .
46007019	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing . Keeping God's commands is what counts .
46007020	Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them .
46007021	Were you a slave when you were called ? Don't let it trouble you — although if you can gain your freedom , do so .
46007022	For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord's freed person ; similarly , the one who was free when called is Christ's slave .
46007023	You were bought at a price ; do not become slaves of human beings .
46007024	Brothers and sisters , each person , as responsible to God , should remain in the situation they were in when God called them .
46007025	Now about virgins : I have no command from the Lord , but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy .
46007026	Because of the present crisis , I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is .
46007027	Are you pledged to a woman ? Do not seek to be released . Are you free from such a commitment ? Do not look for a wife .
46007028	But if you do marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . But those who marry will face many troubles in this life , and I want to spare you this .
46007029	What I mean , brothers and sisters , is that the time is short . From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not ;
46007030	those who mourn , as if they did not ; those who are happy , as if they were not ; those who buy something , as if it were not theirs to keep ;
46007031	those who use the things of the world , as if not engrossed in them . For this world in its present form is passing away .
46007032	I would like you to be free from concern . An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs — how he can please the Lord .
46007033	But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world — how he can please his wife —
46007034	and his interests are divided . An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs : Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world — how she can please her husband .
46007035	I am saying this for your own good , not to restrict you , but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord .
46007036	If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to , and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry , he should do as he wants . He is not sinning . They should get married .
46007037	But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind , who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will , and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin — this man also does the right thing .
46007038	So then , he who marries the virgin does right , but he who does not marry her does better .
46007039	A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry anyone she wishes , but he must belong to the Lord .
46007040	In my judgment , she is happier if she stays as she is — and I think that I too have the Spirit of God .
46008001	Now about food sacrificed to idols : We know that " We all possess knowledge . " But knowledge puffs up while love builds up .
46008002	Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know .
46008003	But whoever loves God is known by God .
46008004	So then , about eating food sacrificed to idols : We know that " An idol is nothing at all in the world " and that " There is no God but one . "
46008005	For even if there are so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ( as indeed there are many " gods " and many " lords " ) ,
46008006	yet for us there is but one God , the Father , from whom all things came and for whom we live ; and there is but one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom all things came and through whom we live .
46008007	But not everyone possesses this knowledge . Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god , and since their conscience is weak , it is defiled .
46008008	But food does not bring us near to God ; we are no worse if we do not eat , and no better if we do .
46008009	Be careful , however , that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak .
46008010	For if someone with a weak conscience sees you , with all your knowledge , eating in an idol's temple , won't that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols ?
46008011	So this weak brother or sister , for whom Christ died , is destroyed by your knowledge .
46008012	When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
46008013	Therefore , if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin , I will never eat meat again , so that I will not cause them to fall .
46009001	Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord ?
46009002	Even though I may not be an apostle to others , surely I am to you ! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
46009003	This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me .
46009004	Don't we have the right to food and drink ?
46009005	Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us , as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas ?
46009006	Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living ?
46009007	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes ? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk ?
46009008	Do I say this merely on human authority ? Doesn't the Law say the same thing ?
46009009	For it is written in the Law of Moses : " Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain . " Is it about oxen that God is concerned ?
46009010	Surely he says this for us , doesn't he ? Yes , this was written for us , because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest .
46009011	If we have sown spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you ?
46009012	If others have this right of support from you , shouldn't we have it all the more ? But we did not use this right . On the contrary , we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ .
46009013	Don't you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple , and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar ?
46009014	In the same way , the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel .
46009015	But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me , for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast .
46009016	For when I preach the gospel , I cannot boast , since I am compelled to preach . Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel !
46009017	If I preach voluntarily , I have a reward ; if not voluntarily , I am simply discharging the trust committed to me .
46009018	What then is my reward ? Just this : that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge , and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel .
46009019	Though I am free and belong to no one , I have made myself a slave to everyone , to win as many as possible .
46009020	To the Jews I became like a Jew , to win the Jews . To those under the law I became like one under the law ( though I myself am not under the law ) , so as to win those under the law .
46009021	To those not having the law I became like one not having the law ( though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law ) , so as to win those not having the law .
46009022	To the weak I became weak , to win the weak . I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some .
46009023	I do all this for the sake of the gospel , that I may share in its blessings .
46009024	Do you not know that in a race all the runners run , but only one gets the prize ? Run in such a way as to get the prize .
46009025	Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training . They do it to get a crown that will not last , but we do it to get a crown that will last forever .
46009026	Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly ; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air .
46009027	No , I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified for the prize .
46010001	For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact , brothers and sisters , that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea .
46010002	They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
46010003	They all ate the same spiritual food
46010004	and drank the same spiritual drink ; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them , and that rock was Christ .
46010005	Nevertheless , God was not pleased with most of them ; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness .
46010006	Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did .
46010007	Do not be idolaters , as some of them were ; as it is written : " The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry . "
46010008	We should not commit sexual immorality , as some of them did — and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died .
46010009	We should not test Christ , as some of them did — and were killed by snakes .
46010010	And do not grumble , as some of them did — and were killed by the destroying angel .
46010011	These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us , on whom the culmination of the ages has come .
46010012	So , if you think you are standing firm , be careful that you don't fall !
46010013	No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind . And God is faithful ; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear . But when you are tempted , he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it .
46010014	Therefore , my dear friends , flee from idolatry .
46010015	I speak to sensible people ; judge for yourselves what I say .
46010016	Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ ?
46010017	Because there is one loaf , we , who are many , are one body , for we all share the one loaf .
46010018	Consider the people of Israel : Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar ?
46010019	Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
46010020	No , but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons , not to God , and I do not want you to be participants with demons .
46010021	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too ; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons .
46010022	Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ?
46010023	" I have the right to do anything , " you say — but not everything is beneficial . " I have the right to do anything " — but not everything is constructive .
46010024	No one should seek their own good , but the good of others .
46010025	Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience ,
46010026	for , " The earth is the Lord's , and everything in it . "
46010027	If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go , eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience .
46010028	But if someone says to you , " This has been offered in sacrifice , " then do not eat it , both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience .
46010029	I am referring to the other person's conscience , not yours . For why is my freedom being judged by another's conscience ?
46010030	If I take part in the meal with thankfulness , why am I denounced because of something I thank God for ?
46010031	So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do , do it all for the glory of God .
46010032	Do not cause anyone to stumble , whether Jews , Greeks or the church of God —
46010033	even as I try to please everyone in every way . For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many , so that they may be saved .
46011001	Follow my example , as I follow the example of Christ .
46011002	I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you .
46011003	But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is man , and the head of Christ is God .
46011004	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head .
46011005	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head — it is the same as having her head shaved .
46011006	For if a woman does not cover her head , she might as well have her hair cut off ; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved , then she should cover her head .
46011007	A man ought not to cover his head , since he is the image and glory of God ; but woman is the glory of man .
46011008	For man did not come from woman , but woman from man ;
46011009	neither was man created for woman , but woman for man .
46011010	It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head , because of the angels .
46011011	Nevertheless , in the Lord woman is not independent of man , nor is man independent of woman .
46011012	For as woman came from man , so also man is born of woman . But everything comes from God .
46011013	Judge for yourselves : Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
46011014	Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a disgrace to him ,
46011015	but that if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? For long hair is given to her as a covering .
46011016	If anyone wants to be contentious about this , we have no other practice — nor do the churches of God .
46011017	In the following directives I have no praise for you , for your meetings do more harm than good .
46011018	In the first place , I hear that when you come together as a church , there are divisions among you , and to some extent I believe it .
46011019	No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval .
46011020	So then , when you come together , it is not the Lord's Supper you eat ,
46011021	for when you are eating , some of you go ahead with your own private suppers . As a result , one person remains hungry and another gets drunk .
46011022	Don't you have homes to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? Certainly not in this matter !
46011023	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you : The Lord Jesus , on the night he was betrayed , took bread ,
46011024	and when he had given thanks , he broke it and said , " This is my body , which is for you ; do this in remembrance of me . "
46011025	In the same way , after supper he took the cup , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood ; do this , whenever you drink it , in remembrance of me . "
46011026	For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes .
46011027	So then , whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord .
46011028	Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup .
46011029	For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves .
46011030	That is why many among you are weak and sick , and a number of you have fallen asleep .
46011031	But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves , we would not come under such judgment .
46011032	Nevertheless , when we are judged in this way by the Lord , we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world .
46011033	So then , my brothers and sisters , when you gather to eat , you should all eat together .
46011034	Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home , so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment . And when I come I will give further directions .
46012001	Now about the gifts of the Spirit , brothers and sisters , I do not want you to be uninformed .
46012002	You know that when you were pagans , somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols .
46012003	Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says , " Jesus be cursed , " and no one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " except by the Holy Spirit .
46012004	There are different kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit distributes them .
46012005	There are different kinds of service , but the same Lord .
46012006	There are different kinds of working , but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work .
46012007	Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good .
46012008	To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom , to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit ,
46012009	to another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit ,
46012010	to another miraculous powers , to another prophecy , to another distinguishing between spirits , to another speaking in different kinds of tongues , and to still another the interpretation of tongues .
46012011	All these are the work of one and the same Spirit , and he distributes them to each one , just as he determines .
46012012	Just as a body , though one , has many parts , but all its many parts form one body , so it is with Christ .
46012013	For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body — whether Jews or Gentiles , slave or free — and we were all given the one Spirit to drink .
46012014	Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many .
46012015	Now if the foot should say , " Because I am not a hand , I do not belong to the body , " it would not for that reason stop being part of the body .
46012016	And if the ear should say , " Because I am not an eye , I do not belong to the body , " it would not for that reason stop being part of the body .
46012017	If the whole body were an eye , where would the sense of hearing be ? If the whole body were an ear , where would the sense of smell be ?
46012018	But in fact God has placed the parts in the body , every one of them , just as he wanted them to be .
46012019	If they were all one part , where would the body be ?
46012020	As it is , there are many parts , but one body .
46012021	The eye cannot say to the hand , " I don't need you ! " And the head cannot say to the feet , " I don't need you ! "
46012022	On the contrary , those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable ,
46012023	and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor . And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty ,
46012024	while our presentable parts need no special treatment . But God has put the body together , giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it ,
46012025	so that there should be no division in the body , but that its parts should have equal concern for each other .
46012026	If one part suffers , every part suffers with it ; if one part is honored , every part rejoices with it .
46012027	Now you are the body of Christ , and each one of you is a part of it .
46012028	And God has placed in the church first of all apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , then gifts of healing , of helping , of guidance , and of different kinds of tongues .
46012029	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Do all work miracles ?
46012030	Do all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak in tongues ? Do all interpret ?
46012031	Now eagerly desire the greater gifts . And yet I will show you the most excellent way .
46013001	If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels , but do not have love , I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal .
46013002	If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have a faith that can move mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing .
46013003	If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast , but do not have love , I gain nothing .
46013004	Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud .
46013005	It does not dishonor others , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs .
46013006	Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth .
46013007	It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres .
46013008	Love never fails . But where there are prophecies , they will cease ; where there are tongues , they will be stilled ; where there is knowledge , it will pass away .
46013009	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ,
46013010	but when completeness comes , what is in part disappears .
46013011	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I put the ways of childhood behind me .
46013012	For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror ; then we shall see face to face . Now I know in part ; then I shall know fully , even as I am fully known .
46013013	And now these three remain : faith , hope and love . But the greatest of these is love .
46014001	Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit , especially prophecy .
46014002	For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God . Indeed , no one understands them ; they utter mysteries by the Spirit .
46014003	But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening , encouraging and comfort .
46014004	Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves , but the one who prophesies edifies the church .
46014005	I would like every one of you to speak in tongues , but I would rather have you prophesy . The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues , unless someone interprets , so that the church may be edified .
46014006	Now , brothers and sisters , if I come to you and speak in tongues , what good will I be to you , unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction ?
46014007	Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds , such as the pipe or harp , how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes ?
46014008	Again , if the trumpet does not sound a clear call , who will get ready for battle ?
46014009	So it is with you . Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue , how will anyone know what you are saying ? You will just be speaking into the air .
46014010	Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world , yet none of them is without meaning .
46014011	If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying , I am a foreigner to the speaker , and the speaker is a foreigner to me .
46014012	So it is with you . Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit , try to excel in those that build up the church .
46014013	For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say .
46014014	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is unfruitful .
46014015	So what shall I do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my understanding ; I will sing with my spirit , but I will also sing with my understanding .
46014016	Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit , how can someone else , who is now put in the position of an inquirer , say " Amen " to your thanksgiving , since they do not know what you are saying ?
46014017	You are giving thanks well enough , but no one else is edified .
46014018	I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you .
46014019	But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue .
46014020	Brothers and sisters , stop thinking like children . In regard to evil be infants , but in your thinking be adults .
46014021	In the Law it is written :
46014022	Tongues , then , are a sign , not for believers but for unbelievers ; prophecy , however , is not for unbelievers but for believers .
46014023	So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues , and inquirers or unbelievers come in , will they not say that you are out of your mind ?
46014024	But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying , they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all ,
46014025	as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare . So they will fall down and worship God , exclaiming , " God is really among you ! "
46014026	What then shall we say , brothers and sisters ? When you come together , each of you has a hymn , or a word of instruction , a revelation , a tongue or an interpretation . Everything must be done so that the church may be built up .
46014027	If anyone speaks in a tongue , two — or at the most three — should speak , one at a time , and someone must interpret .
46014028	If there is no interpreter , the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God .
46014029	Two or three prophets should speak , and the others should weigh carefully what is said .
46014030	And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down , the first speaker should stop .
46014031	For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged .
46014032	The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets .
46014033	For God is not a God of disorder but of peace — as in all the congregations of the Lord's people .
46014034	Women should remain silent in the churches . They are not allowed to speak , but must be in submission , as the law says .
46014035	If they want to inquire about something , they should ask their own husbands at home ; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church .
46014036	Or did the word of God originate with you ? Or are you the only people it has reached ?
46014037	If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit , let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command .
46014038	But if anyone ignores this , they will themselves be ignored .
46014039	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , be eager to prophesy , and do not forbid speaking in tongues .
46014040	But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way .
46015001	Now , brothers and sisters , I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you , which you received and on which you have taken your stand .
46015002	By this gospel you are saved , if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you . Otherwise , you have believed in vain .
46015003	For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures ,
46015004	that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures ,
46015005	and that he appeared to Cephas , and then to the Twelve .
46015006	After that , he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time , most of whom are still living , though some have fallen asleep .
46015007	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles ,
46015008	and last of all he appeared to me also , as to one abnormally born .
46015009	For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
46015010	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace to me was not without effect . No , I worked harder than all of them — yet not I , but the grace of God that was with me .
46015011	Whether , then , it is I or they , this is what we preach , and this is what you believed .
46015012	But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead , how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
46015013	If there is no resurrection of the dead , then not even Christ has been raised .
46015014	And if Christ has not been raised , our preaching is useless and so is your faith .
46015015	More than that , we are then found to be false witnesses about God , for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead . But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised .
46015016	For if the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised either .
46015017	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is futile ; you are still in your sins .
46015018	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost .
46015019	If only for this life we have hope in Christ , we are of all people most to be pitied .
46015020	But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep .
46015021	For since death came through a man , the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man .
46015022	For as in Adam all die , so in Christ all will be made alive .
46015023	But each in turn : Christ , the firstfruits ; then , when he comes , those who belong to him .
46015024	Then the end will come , when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion , authority and power .
46015025	For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
46015026	The last enemy to be destroyed is death .
46015027	For he " has put everything under his feet . " Now when it says that " everything " has been put under him , it is clear that this does not include God himself , who put everything under Christ .
46015028	When he has done this , then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him , so that God may be all in all .
46015029	Now if there is no resurrection , what will those do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people baptized for them ?
46015030	And as for us , why do we endanger ourselves every hour ?
46015031	I face death every day — yes , just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord .
46015032	If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes , what have I gained ? If the dead are not raised ,
46015034	Come back to your senses as you ought , and stop sinning ; for there are some who are ignorant of God — I say this to your shame .
46015035	But someone will ask , " How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body will they come ? "
46015036	How foolish ! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
46015037	When you sow , you do not plant the body that will be , but just a seed , perhaps of wheat or of something else .
46015038	But God gives it a body as he has determined , and to each kind of seed he gives its own body .
46015039	Not all flesh is the same : People have one kind of flesh , animals have another , birds another and fish another .
46015040	There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies ; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind , and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another .
46015041	The sun has one kind of splendor , the moon another and the stars another ; and star differs from star in splendor .
46015042	So will it be with the resurrection of the dead . The body that is sown is perishable , it is raised imperishable ;
46015043	it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power ;
46015044	it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
46015045	So it is written : " The first man Adam became a living being " ; the last Adam , a life-giving spirit .
46015046	The spiritual did not come first , but the natural , and after that the spiritual .
46015047	The first man was of the dust of the earth ; the second man is of heaven .
46015048	As was the earthly man , so are those who are of the earth ; and as is the heavenly man , so also are those who are of heaven .
46015049	And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man , so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man .
46015050	I declare to you , brothers and sisters , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God , nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable .
46015051	Listen , I tell you a mystery : We will not all sleep , but we will all be changed —
46015052	in a flash , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , the dead will be raised imperishable , and we will be changed .
46015053	For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable , and the mortal with immortality .
46015054	When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable , and the mortal with immortality , then the saying that is written will come true : " Death has been swallowed up in victory . "
46015055	" Where , O death , is your victory ?
46015056	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
46015057	But thanks be to God ! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
46015058	Therefore , my dear brothers and sisters , stand firm . Let nothing move you . Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord , because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain .
46016001	Now about the collection for the Lord's people : Do what I told the Galatian churches to do .
46016002	On the first day of every week , each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income , saving it up , so that when I come no collections will have to be made .
46016003	Then , when I arrive , I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem .
46016004	If it seems advisable for me to go also , they will accompany me .
46016005	After I go through Macedonia , I will come to you — for I will be going through Macedonia .
46016006	Perhaps I will stay with you for a while , or even spend the winter , so that you can help me on my journey , wherever I go .
46016007	For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit ; I hope to spend some time with you , if the Lord permits .
46016008	But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost ,
46016009	because a great door for effective work has opened to me , and there are many who oppose me .
46016010	When Timothy comes , see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you , for he is carrying on the work of the Lord , just as I am .
46016011	No one , then , should treat him with contempt . Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me . I am expecting him along with the brothers .
46016012	Now about our brother Apollos : I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers . He was quite unwilling to go now , but he will go when he has the opportunity .
46016013	Be on your guard ; stand firm in the faith ; be courageous ; be strong .
46016014	Do everything in love .
46016015	You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia , and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord's people . I urge you , brothers and sisters ,
46016016	to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it .
46016017	I was glad when Stephanas , Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived , because they have supplied what was lacking from you .
46016018	For they refreshed my spirit and yours also . Such men deserve recognition .
46016019	The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings . Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord , and so does the church that meets at their house .
46016020	All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
46016021	I , Paul , write this greeting in my own hand .
46016022	If anyone does not love the Lord , let that person be cursed ! Come , Lord !
46016023	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
46016024	My love to all of you in Christ Jesus . Amen .
47001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , To the church of God in Corinth , together with all his holy people throughout Achaia :
47001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
47001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort ,
47001004	who comforts us in all our troubles , so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God .
47001005	For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ , so also our comfort abounds through Christ .
47001006	If we are distressed , it is for your comfort and salvation ; if we are comforted , it is for your comfort , which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer .
47001007	And our hope for you is firm , because we know that just as you share in our sufferings , so also you share in our comfort .
47001008	We do not want you to be uninformed , brothers and sisters , about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia . We were under great pressure , far beyond our ability to endure , so that we despaired of life itself .
47001009	Indeed , we felt we had received the sentence of death . But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God , who raises the dead .
47001010	He has delivered us from such a deadly peril , and he will deliver us again . On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us ,
47001011	as you help us by your prayers . Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many .
47001012	Now this is our boast : Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world , and especially in our relations with you , with integrity and godly sincerity . We have done so , relying not on worldly wisdom but on God's grace .
47001013	For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand . And I hope that ,
47001014	as you have understood us in part , you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus .
47001015	Because I was confident of this , I wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice .
47001016	I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia , and then to have you send me on my way to Judea .
47001017	Was I fickle when I intended to do this ? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say both " Yes , yes " and " No , no " ?
47001018	But as surely as God is faithful , our message to you is not " Yes " and " No . "
47001019	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us — by me and Silas and Timothy — was not " Yes " and " No , " but in him it has always been " Yes . "
47001020	For no matter how many promises God has made , they are " Yes " in Christ . And so through him the " Amen " is spoken by us to the glory of God .
47001021	Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ . He anointed us ,
47001022	set his seal of ownership on us , and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit , guaranteeing what is to come .
47001023	I call God as my witness — and I stake my life on it — that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth .
47001024	Not that we lord it over your faith , but we work with you for your joy , because it is by faith you stand firm .
47002001	So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you .
47002002	For if I grieve you , who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved ?
47002003	I wrote as I did , so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice . I had confidence in all of you , that you would all share my joy .
47002004	For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears , not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you .
47002005	If anyone has caused grief , he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent — not to put it too severely .
47002006	The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient .
47002007	Now instead , you ought to forgive and comfort him , so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
47002008	I urge you , therefore , to reaffirm your love for him .
47002009	Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything .
47002010	Anyone you forgive , I also forgive . And what I have forgiven — if there was anything to forgive — I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake ,
47002011	in order that Satan might not outwit us . For we are not unaware of his schemes .
47002012	Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me ,
47002013	I still had no peace of mind , because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia .
47002014	But thanks be to God , who always leads us as captives in Christ's triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere .
47002015	For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing .
47002016	To the one we are an aroma that brings death ; to the other , an aroma that brings life . And who is equal to such a task ?
47002017	Unlike so many , we do not peddle the word of God for profit . On the contrary , in Christ we speak before God with sincerity , as those sent from God .
47003001	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again ? Or do we need , like some people , letters of recommendation to you or from you ?
47003002	You yourselves are our letter , written on our hearts , known and read by everyone .
47003003	You show that you are a letter from Christ , the result of our ministry , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts .
47003004	Such confidence we have through Christ before God .
47003005	Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves , but our competence comes from God .
47003006	He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant — not of the letter but of the Spirit ; for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
47003007	Now if the ministry that brought death , which was engraved in letters on stone , came with glory , so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory , transitory though it was ,
47003008	will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious ?
47003009	If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious , how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness !
47003010	For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory .
47003011	And if what was transitory came with glory , how much greater is the glory of that which lasts !
47003012	Therefore , since we have such a hope , we are very bold .
47003013	We are not like Moses , who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away .
47003014	But their minds were made dull , for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read . It has not been removed , because only in Christ is it taken away .
47003015	Even to this day when Moses is read , a veil covers their hearts .
47003016	But whenever anyone turns to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
47003017	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
47003018	And we all , who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory , are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory , which comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit .
47004001	Therefore , since through God's mercy we have this ministry , we do not lose heart .
47004002	Rather , we have renounced secret and shameful ways ; we do not use deception , nor do we distort the word of God . On the contrary , by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God .
47004003	And even if our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are perishing .
47004004	The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers , so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
47004005	For what we preach is not ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake .
47004006	For God , who said , " Let light shine out of darkness , " made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory displayed in the face of Christ .
47004007	But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us .
47004008	We are hard pressed on every side , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not in despair ;
47004009	persecuted , but not abandoned ; struck down , but not destroyed .
47004010	We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus , so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
47004011	For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake , so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body .
47004012	So then , death is at work in us , but life is at work in you .
47004013	It is written : " I believed ; therefore I have spoken . " Since we have that same spirit of faith , we also believe and therefore speak ,
47004014	because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself .
47004015	All this is for your benefit , so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God .
47004016	Therefore we do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away , yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day .
47004017	For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all .
47004018	So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen , since what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal .
47005001	For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed , we have a building from God , an eternal house in heaven , not built by human hands .
47005002	Meanwhile we groan , longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling ,
47005003	because when we are clothed , we will not be found naked .
47005004	For while we are in this tent , we groan and are burdened , because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling , so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
47005005	Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God , who has given us the Spirit as a deposit , guaranteeing what is to come .
47005006	Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord .
47005007	For we live by faith , not by sight .
47005008	We are confident , I say , and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord .
47005009	So we make it our goal to please him , whether we are at home in the body or away from it .
47005010	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body , whether good or bad .
47005011	Since , then , we know what it is to fear the Lord , we try to persuade others . What we are is plain to God , and I hope it is also plain to your conscience .
47005012	We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again , but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us , so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart .
47005013	If we are " out of our mind , " as some say , it is for God ; if we are in our right mind , it is for you .
47005014	For Christ's love compels us , because we are convinced that one died for all , and therefore all died .
47005015	And he died for all , that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again .
47005016	So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view . Though we once regarded Christ in this way , we do so no longer .
47005017	Therefore , if anyone is in Christ , the new creation has come : The old has gone , the new is here !
47005018	All this is from God , who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation :
47005019	that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ , not counting people's sins against them . And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation .
47005020	We are therefore Christ's ambassadors , as though God were making his appeal through us . We implore you on Christ's behalf : Be reconciled to God .
47005021	God made him who had no sin to be sin for us , so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
47006001	As God's co-workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain .
47006002	For he says ,
47006003	We put no stumbling block in anyone's path , so that our ministry will not be discredited .
47006004	Rather , as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way : in great endurance ; in troubles , hardships and distresses ;
47006005	in beatings , imprisonments and riots ; in hard work , sleepless nights and hunger ;
47006006	in purity , understanding , patience and kindness ; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love ;
47006007	in truthful speech and in the power of God ; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left ;
47006008	through glory and dishonor , bad report and good report ; genuine , yet regarded as impostors ;
47006009	known , yet regarded as unknown ; dying , and yet we live on ; beaten , and yet not killed ;
47006010	sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; poor , yet making many rich ; having nothing , and yet possessing everything .
47006011	We have spoken freely to you , Corinthians , and opened wide our hearts to you .
47006012	We are not withholding our affection from you , but you are withholding yours from us .
47006013	As a fair exchange — I speak as to my children — open wide your hearts also .
47006014	Do not be yoked together with unbelievers . For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common ? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness ?
47006015	What harmony is there between Christ and Belial ? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols ? For we are the temple of the living God . As God has said : " I will live with them and walk among them , and I will be their God , and they will be my people . "
47006017	Therefore , " Come out from them and be separate , says the Lord . Touch no unclean thing , and I will receive you . "
47006018	And , " I will be a Father to you , and you will be my sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty . "
47007001	Therefore , since we have these promises , dear friends , let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit , perfecting holiness out of reverence for God .
47007002	Make room for us in your hearts . We have wronged no one , we have corrupted no one , we have exploited no one .
47007003	I do not say this to condemn you ; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you .
47007004	I have spoken to you with great frankness ; I take great pride in you . I am greatly encouraged ; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds .
47007005	For when we came into Macedonia , we had no rest , but we were harassed at every turn — conflicts on the outside , fears within .
47007006	But God , who comforts the downcast , comforted us by the coming of Titus ,
47007007	and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him . He told us about your longing for me , your deep sorrow , your ardent concern for me , so that my joy was greater than ever .
47007008	Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter , I do not regret it . Though I did regret it — I see that my letter hurt you , but only for a little while —
47007009	yet now I am happy , not because you were made sorry , but because your sorrow led you to repentance . For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us .
47007010	Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret , but worldly sorrow brings death .
47007011	See what this godly sorrow has produced in you : what earnestness , what eagerness to clear yourselves , what indignation , what alarm , what longing , what concern , what readiness to see justice done . At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter .
47007012	So even though I wrote to you , it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party , but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are .
47007013	By all this we are encouraged . In addition to our own encouragement , we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was , because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you .
47007014	I had boasted to him about you , and you have not embarrassed me . But just as everything we said to you was true , so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well .
47007015	And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient , receiving him with fear and trembling .
47007016	I am glad I can have complete confidence in you .
47008001	And now , brothers and sisters , we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches .
47008002	In the midst of a very severe trial , their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity .
47008003	For I testify that they gave as much as they were able , and even beyond their ability . Entirely on their own ,
47008004	they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord's people .
47008005	And they exceeded our expectations : They gave themselves first of all to the Lord , and then by the will of God also to us .
47008006	So we urged Titus , just as he had earlier made a beginning , to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part .
47008007	But since you excel in everything — in faith , in speech , in knowledge , in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you — see that you also excel in this grace of giving .
47008008	I am not commanding you , but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others .
47008009	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that though he was rich , yet for your sake he became poor , so that you through his poverty might become rich .
47008010	And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter . Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so .
47008011	Now finish the work , so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it , according to your means .
47008012	For if the willingness is there , the gift is acceptable according to what one has , not according to what one does not have .
47008013	Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed , but that there might be equality .
47008014	At the present time your plenty will supply what they need , so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need . The goal is equality ,
47008015	as it is written : " The one who gathered much did not have too much , and the one who gathered little did not have too little . "
47008016	Thanks be to God , who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you .
47008017	For Titus not only welcomed our appeal , but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative .
47008018	And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel .
47008019	What is more , he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering , which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help .
47008020	We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift .
47008021	For we are taking pains to do what is right , not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man .
47008022	In addition , we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous , and now even more so because of his great confidence in you .
47008023	As for Titus , he is my partner and co-worker among you ; as for our brothers , they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ .
47008024	Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you , so that the churches can see it .
47009001	There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord's people .
47009002	For I know your eagerness to help , and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians , telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give ; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action .
47009003	But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow , but that you may be ready , as I said you would be .
47009004	For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we — not to say anything about you — would be ashamed of having been so confident .
47009005	So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised . Then it will be ready as a generous gift , not as one grudgingly given .
47009006	Remember this : Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and whoever sows generously will also reap generously .
47009007	Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give , not reluctantly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver .
47009008	And God is able to bless you abundantly , so that in all things at all times , having all that you need , you will abound in every good work .
47009009	As it is written :
47009011	You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion , and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God .
47009012	This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God .
47009013	Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves , others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ , and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else .
47009014	And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you , because of the surpassing grace God has given you .
47009015	Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift !
47010001	By the humility and gentleness of Christ , I appeal to you — I , Paul , who am " timid " when face to face with you , but " bold " toward you when away !
47010002	I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world .
47010003	For though we live in the world , we do not wage war as the world does .
47010004	The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world . On the contrary , they have divine power to demolish strongholds .
47010005	We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God , and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ .
47010006	And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience , once your obedience is complete .
47010007	You are judging by appearances . If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ , they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do .
47010008	So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down , I will not be ashamed of it .
47010009	I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters .
47010010	For some say , " His letters are weighty and forceful , but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing . "
47010011	Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent , we will be in our actions when we are present .
47010012	We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves . When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they are not wise .
47010013	We , however , will not boast beyond proper limits , but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us , a sphere that also includes you .
47010014	We are not going too far in our boasting , as would be the case if we had not come to you , for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ .
47010015	Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others . Our hope is that , as your faith continues to grow , our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand ,
47010016	so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you . For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else's territory .
47010017	But , " Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord . "
47010018	For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved , but the one whom the Lord commends .
47011001	I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness . Yes , please put up with me !
47011002	I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy . I promised you to one husband , to Christ , so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him .
47011003	But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning , your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ .
47011004	For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received , or a different gospel from the one you accepted , you put up with it easily enough .
47011005	I do not think I am in the least inferior to those " super-apostles . "
47011006	I may indeed be untrained as a speaker , but I do have knowledge . We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way .
47011007	Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge ?
47011008	I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you .
47011009	And when I was with you and needed something , I was not a burden to anyone , for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed . I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way , and will continue to do so .
47011010	As surely as the truth of Christ is in me , nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine .
47011011	Why ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
47011012	And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about .
47011013	For such people are false apostles , deceitful workers , masquerading as apostles of Christ .
47011014	And no wonder , for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light .
47011015	It is not surprising , then , if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness . Their end will be what their actions deserve .
47011016	I repeat : Let no one take me for a fool . But if you do , then tolerate me just as you would a fool , so that I may do a little boasting .
47011017	In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would , but as a fool .
47011018	Since many are boasting in the way the world does , I too will boast .
47011019	You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise !
47011020	In fact , you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face .
47011021	To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that ! Whatever anyone else dares to boast about — I am speaking as a fool — I also dare to boast about .
47011022	Are they Hebrews ? So am I . Are they Israelites ? So am I . Are they Abraham's descendants ? So am I .
47011023	Are they servants of Christ ? ( I am out of my mind to talk like this . ) I am more . I have worked much harder , been in prison more frequently , been flogged more severely , and been exposed to death again and again .
47011024	Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one .
47011025	Three times I was beaten with rods , once I was pelted with stones , three times I was shipwrecked , I spent a night and a day in the open sea ,
47011026	I have been constantly on the move . I have been in danger from rivers , in danger from bandits , in danger from my fellow Jews , in danger from Gentiles ; in danger in the city , in danger in the country , in danger at sea ; and in danger from false believers .
47011027	I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep ; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food ; I have been cold and naked .
47011028	Besides everything else , I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches .
47011029	Who is weak , and I do not feel weak ? Who is led into sin , and I do not inwardly burn ?
47011030	If I must boast , I will boast of the things that show my weakness .
47011031	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , who is to be praised forever , knows that I am not lying .
47011032	In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me .
47011033	But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands .
47012001	I must go on boasting . Although there is nothing to be gained , I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord .
47012002	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven . Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know — God knows .
47012003	And I know that this man — whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know , but God knows —
47012004	was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things , things that no one is permitted to tell .
47012005	I will boast about a man like that , but I will not boast about myself , except about my weaknesses .
47012006	Even if I should choose to boast , I would not be a fool , because I would be speaking the truth . But I refrain , so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say ,
47012007	or because of these surpassingly great revelations . Therefore , in order to keep me from becoming conceited , I was given a thorn in my flesh , a messenger of Satan , to torment me .
47012008	Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me .
47012009	But he said to me , " My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . " Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses , so that Christ's power may rest on me .
47012010	That is why , for Christ's sake , I delight in weaknesses , in insults , in hardships , in persecutions , in difficulties . For when I am weak , then I am strong .
47012011	I have made a fool of myself , but you drove me to it . I ought to have been commended by you , for I am not in the least inferior to the " super-apostles , " even though I am nothing .
47012012	I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle , including signs , wonders and miracles .
47012013	How were you inferior to the other churches , except that I was never a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
47012014	Now I am ready to visit you for the third time , and I will not be a burden to you , because what I want is not your possessions but you . After all , children should not have to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
47012015	So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
47012016	Be that as it may , I have not been a burden to you . Yet , crafty fellow that I am , I caught you by trickery !
47012017	Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you ?
47012018	I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him . Titus did not exploit you , did he ? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit ?
47012019	Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you ? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ ; and everything we do , dear friends , is for your strengthening .
47012020	For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be , and you may not find me as you want me to be . I fear that there may be discord , jealousy , fits of rage , selfish ambition , slander , gossip , arrogance and disorder .
47012021	I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you , and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity , sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged .
47013001	This will be my third visit to you . " Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses . "
47013002	I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time . I now repeat it while absent : On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others ,
47013003	since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me . He is not weak in dealing with you , but is powerful among you .
47013004	For to be sure , he was crucified in weakness , yet he lives by God's power . Likewise , we are weak in him , yet by God's power we will live with him in our dealing with you .
47013005	Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith ; test yourselves . Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you — unless , of course , you fail the test ?
47013006	And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test .
47013007	Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong — not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed .
47013008	For we cannot do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
47013009	We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong ; and our prayer is that you may be fully restored .
47013010	This is why I write these things when I am absent , that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority — the authority the Lord gave me for building you up , not for tearing you down .
47013011	Finally , brothers and sisters , rejoice ! Strive for full restoration , encourage one another , be of one mind , live in peace . And the God of love and peace will be with you .
47013012	Greet one another with a holy kiss .
47013013	All God's people here send their greetings .
47013014	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all .
48001001	Paul , an apostle — sent not from men nor by a man , but by Jesus Christ and God the Father , who raised him from the dead —
48001002	and all the brothers and sisters with me , To the churches in Galatia :
48001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ,
48001004	who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age , according to the will of our God and Father ,
48001005	to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
48001006	I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel —
48001007	which is really no gospel at all . Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ .
48001008	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you , let them be under God's curse !
48001009	As we have already said , so now I say again : If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted , let them be under God's curse !
48001010	Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings , or of God ? Or am I trying to please people ? If I were still trying to please people , I would not be a servant of Christ .
48001011	I want you to know , brothers and sisters , that the gospel I preached is not of human origin .
48001012	I did not receive it from any man , nor was I taught it ; rather , I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ .
48001013	For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism , how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it .
48001014	I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
48001015	But when God , who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace , was pleased
48001016	to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles , my immediate response was not to consult any human being .
48001017	I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was , but I went into Arabia . Later I returned to Damascus .
48001018	Then after three years , I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days .
48001019	I saw none of the other apostles — only James , the Lord's brother .
48001020	I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie .
48001021	Then I went to Syria and Cilicia .
48001022	I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ .
48001023	They only heard the report : " The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy . "
48001024	And they praised God because of me .
48002001	Then after fourteen years , I went up again to Jerusalem , this time with Barnabas . I took Titus along also .
48002002	I went in response to a revelation and , meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders , I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles . I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain .
48002003	Yet not even Titus , who was with me , was compelled to be circumcised , even though he was a Greek .
48002004	This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves .
48002005	We did not give in to them for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you .
48002006	As for those who were held in high esteem — whatever they were makes no difference to me ; God does not show favoritism — they added nothing to my message .
48002007	On the contrary , they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised , just as Peter had been to the circumcised .
48002008	For God , who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised , was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles .
48002009	James , Cephas and John , those esteemed as pillars , gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me . They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles , and they to the circumcised .
48002010	All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor , the very thing I had been eager to do all along .
48002011	When Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he stood condemned .
48002012	For before certain men came from James , he used to eat with the Gentiles . But when they arrived , he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group .
48002013	The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy , so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray .
48002014	When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in front of them all , " You are a Jew , yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew . How is it , then , that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs ?
48002015	" We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles
48002016	know that a person is not justified by the works of the law , but by faith in Jesus Christ . So we , too , have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law , because by the works of the law no one will be justified .
48002017	" But if , in seeking to be justified in Christ , we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners , doesn't that mean that Christ promotes sin ? Absolutely not !
48002018	If I rebuild what I destroyed , then I really would be a lawbreaker .
48002019	" For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God .
48002020	I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live , but Christ lives in me . The life I now live in the body , I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me .
48002021	I do not set aside the grace of God , for if righteousness could be gained through the law , Christ died for nothing ! "
48003001	You foolish Galatians ! Who has bewitched you ? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified .
48003002	I would like to learn just one thing from you : Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by believing what you heard ?
48003003	Are you so foolish ? After beginning by means of the Spirit , are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh ?
48003004	Have you experienced so much in vain — if it really was in vain ?
48003005	So again I ask , does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law , or by your believing what you heard ?
48003006	So also Abraham " believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . "
48003007	Understand , then , that those who have faith are children of Abraham .
48003008	Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham : " All nations will be blessed through you . "
48003009	So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham , the man of faith .
48003010	For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse , as it is written : " Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law . "
48003011	Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God , because " the righteous will live by faith . "
48003012	The law is not based on faith ; on the contrary , it says , " The person who does these things will live by them . "
48003013	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us , for it is written : " Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole . "
48003014	He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus , so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit .
48003015	Brothers and sisters , let me take an example from everyday life . Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established , so it is in this case .
48003016	The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . Scripture does not say " and to seeds , " meaning many people , but " and to your seed , " meaning one person , who is Christ .
48003017	What I mean is this : The law , introduced 430 years later , does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise .
48003018	For if the inheritance depends on the law , then it no longer depends on the promise ; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise .
48003019	Why , then , was the law given at all ? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come . The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator .
48003020	A mediator , however , implies more than one party ; but God is one .
48003021	Is the law , therefore , opposed to the promises of God ? Absolutely not ! For if a law had been given that could impart life , then righteousness would certainly have come by the law .
48003022	But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin , so that what was promised , being given through faith in Jesus Christ , might be given to those who believe .
48003023	Before the coming of this faith , we were held in custody under the law , locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed .
48003024	So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith .
48003025	Now that this faith has come , we are no longer under a guardian .
48003026	So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith ,
48003027	for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ .
48003028	There is neither Jew nor Gentile , neither slave nor free , nor is there male and female , for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
48003029	If you belong to Christ , then you are Abraham's seed , and heirs according to the promise .
48004001	What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage , he is no different from a slave , although he owns the whole estate .
48004002	The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father .
48004003	So also , when we were underage , we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world .
48004004	But when the set time had fully come , God sent his Son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
48004005	to redeem those under the law , that we might receive adoption to sonship .
48004006	Because you are his sons , God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , the Spirit who calls out , " Abba , Father . "
48004007	So you are no longer a slave , but God's child ; and since you are his child , God has made you also an heir .
48004008	Formerly , when you did not know God , you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods .
48004009	But now that you know God — or rather are known by God — how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces ? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again ?
48004010	You are observing special days and months and seasons and years !
48004011	I fear for you , that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you .
48004012	I plead with you , brothers and sisters , become like me , for I became like you . You did me no wrong .
48004013	As you know , it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you ,
48004014	and even though my illness was a trial to you , you did not treat me with contempt or scorn . Instead , you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God , as if I were Christ Jesus himself .
48004015	Where , then , is your blessing of me now ? I can testify that , if you could have done so , you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me .
48004016	Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
48004017	Those people are zealous to win you over , but for no good . What they want is to alienate you from us , so that you may have zeal for them .
48004018	It is fine to be zealous , provided the purpose is good , and to be so always , not just when I am with you .
48004019	My dear children , for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you ,
48004020	how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone , because I am perplexed about you !
48004021	Tell me , you who want to be under the law , are you not aware of what the law says ?
48004022	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman .
48004023	His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh , but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise .
48004024	These things are being taken figuratively : The women represent two covenants . One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves : This is Hagar .
48004025	Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem , because she is in slavery with her children .
48004026	But the Jerusalem that is above is free , and she is our mother .
48004027	For it is written :
48004029	At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit . It is the same now .
48004030	But what does Scripture say ? " Get rid of the slave woman and her son , for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son . "
48004031	Therefore , brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman , but of the free woman .
48005001	It is for freedom that Christ has set us free . Stand firm , then , and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery .
48005002	Mark my words ! I , Paul , tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised , Christ will be of no value to you at all .
48005003	Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law .
48005004	You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ ; you have fallen away from grace .
48005005	For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope .
48005006	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value . The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love .
48005007	You were running a good race . Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth ?
48005008	That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you .
48005009	" A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough . "
48005010	I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view . The one who is throwing you into confusion , whoever that may be , will have to pay the penalty .
48005011	Brothers and sisters , if I am still preaching circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished .
48005012	As for those agitators , I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves !
48005013	You , my brothers and sisters , were called to be free . But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh ; rather , serve one another humbly in love .
48005014	For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command : " Love your neighbor as yourself . "
48005015	If you bite and devour each other , watch out or you will be destroyed by each other .
48005016	So I say , walk by the Spirit , and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh .
48005017	For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit , and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh . They are in conflict with each other , so that you are not to do whatever you want .
48005018	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
48005019	The acts of the flesh are obvious : sexual immorality , impurity and debauchery ;
48005020	idolatry and witchcraft ; hatred , discord , jealousy , fits of rage , selfish ambition , dissensions , factions
48005021	and envy ; drunkenness , orgies , and the like . I warn you , as I did before , that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God .
48005022	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , forbearance , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
48005023	gentleness and self-control . Against such things there is no law .
48005024	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
48005025	Since we live by the Spirit , let us keep in step with the Spirit .
48005026	Let us not become conceited , provoking and envying each other .
48006001	Brothers and sisters , if someone is caught in a sin , you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently . But watch yourselves , or you also may be tempted .
48006002	Carry each other's burdens , and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ .
48006003	If anyone thinks they are something when they are not , they deceive themselves .
48006004	Each one should test their own actions . Then they can take pride in themselves alone , without comparing themselves to someone else ,
48006005	for each one should carry their own load .
48006006	Nevertheless , the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor .
48006007	Do not be deceived : God cannot be mocked . A man reaps what he sows .
48006008	Whoever sows to please their flesh , from the flesh will reap destruction ; whoever sows to please the Spirit , from the Spirit will reap eternal life .
48006009	Let us not become weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up .
48006010	Therefore , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , especially to those who belong to the family of believers .
48006011	See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand !
48006012	Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised . The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ .
48006013	Not even those who are circumcised keep the law , yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh .
48006014	May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
48006015	Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything ; what counts is the new creation .
48006016	Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule — to the Israel of God .
48006017	From now on , let no one cause me trouble , for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus .
48006018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers and sisters . Amen .
49001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , To God's holy people in Ephesus , the faithful in Christ Jesus :
49001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ .
49001004	For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight . In love
49001005	he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ , in accordance with his pleasure and will —
49001006	to the praise of his glorious grace , which he has freely given us in the One he loves .
49001007	In him we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , in accordance with the riches of God's grace
49001008	that he lavished on us . With all wisdom and understanding ,
49001009	he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure , which he purposed in Christ ,
49001010	to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment — to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ .
49001011	In him we were also chosen , having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will ,
49001012	in order that we , who were the first to put our hope in Christ , might be for the praise of his glory .
49001013	And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth , the gospel of your salvation . When you believed , you were marked in him with a seal , the promised Holy Spirit ,
49001014	who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession — to the praise of his glory .
49001015	For this reason , ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people ,
49001016	I have not stopped giving thanks for you , remembering you in my prayers .
49001017	I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the glorious Father , may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation , so that you may know him better .
49001018	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you , the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people ,
49001019	and his incomparably great power for us who believe . That power is the same as the mighty strength
49001020	he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms ,
49001021	far above all rule and authority , power and dominion , and every name that is invoked , not only in the present age but also in the one to come .
49001022	And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church ,
49001023	which is his body , the fullness of him who fills everything in every way .
49002001	As for you , you were dead in your transgressions and sins ,
49002002	in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air , the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient .
49002003	All of us also lived among them at one time , gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts . Like the rest , we were by nature deserving of wrath .
49002004	But because of his great love for us , God , who is rich in mercy ,
49002005	made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions — it is by grace you have been saved .
49002006	And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus ,
49002007	in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace , expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus .
49002008	For it is by grace you have been saved , through faith — and this is not from yourselves , it is the gift of God —
49002009	not by works , so that no one can boast .
49002010	For we are God's handiwork , created in Christ Jesus to do good works , which God prepared in advance for us to do .
49002011	Therefore , remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called " uncircumcised " by those who call themselves " the circumcision " ( which is done in the body by human hands ) —
49002012	remember that at that time you were separate from Christ , excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise , without hope and without God in the world .
49002013	But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ .
49002014	For he himself is our peace , who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier , the dividing wall of hostility ,
49002015	by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations . His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two , thus making peace ,
49002016	and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross , by which he put to death their hostility .
49002017	He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near .
49002018	For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit .
49002019	Consequently , you are no longer foreigners and strangers , but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household ,
49002020	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone .
49002021	In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord .
49002022	And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit .
49003001	For this reason I , Paul , the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles —
49003002	Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you ,
49003003	that is , the mystery made known to me by revelation , as I have already written briefly .
49003004	In reading this , then , you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ ,
49003005	which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets .
49003006	This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel , members together of one body , and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus .
49003007	I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power .
49003008	Although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people , this grace was given me : to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ ,
49003009	and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery , which for ages past was kept hidden in God , who created all things .
49003010	His intent was that now , through the church , the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms ,
49003011	according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord .
49003012	In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence .
49003013	I ask you , therefore , not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you , which are your glory .
49003014	For this reason I kneel before the Father ,
49003015	from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name .
49003016	I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being ,
49003017	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith . And I pray that you , being rooted and established in love ,
49003018	may have power , together with all the Lord's holy people , to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ ,
49003019	and to know this love that surpasses knowledge — that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God .
49003020	Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine , according to his power that is at work within us ,
49003021	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations , for ever and ever ! Amen .
49004001	As a prisoner for the Lord , then , I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received .
49004002	Be completely humble and gentle ; be patient , bearing with one another in love .
49004003	Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace .
49004004	There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were called to one hope when you were called ;
49004005	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ;
49004006	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
49004007	But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it .
49004008	This is why it says :
49004010	He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens , in order to fill the whole universe . )
49004011	So Christ himself gave the apostles , the prophets , the evangelists , the pastors and teachers ,
49004012	to equip his people for works of service , so that the body of Christ may be built up
49004013	until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature , attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ .
49004014	Then we will no longer be infants , tossed back and forth by the waves , and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming .
49004015	Instead , speaking the truth in love , we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head , that is , Christ .
49004016	From him the whole body , joined and held together by every supporting ligament , grows and builds itself up in love , as each part does its work .
49004017	So I tell you this , and insist on it in the Lord , that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do , in the futility of their thinking .
49004018	They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts .
49004019	Having lost all sensitivity , they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity , and they are full of greed .
49004020	That , however , is not the way of life you learned
49004021	when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus .
49004022	You were taught , with regard to your former way of life , to put off your old self , which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires ;
49004023	to be made new in the attitude of your minds ;
49004024	and to put on the new self , created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness .
49004025	Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor , for we are all members of one body .
49004026	" In your anger do not sin " : Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry ,
49004027	and do not give the devil a foothold .
49004028	Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer , but must work , doing something useful with their own hands , that they may have something to share with those in need .
49004029	Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths , but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs , that it may benefit those who listen .
49004030	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
49004031	Get rid of all bitterness , rage and anger , brawling and slander , along with every form of malice .
49004032	Be kind and compassionate to one another , forgiving each other , just as in Christ God forgave you .
49005001	Follow God's example , therefore , as dearly loved children
49005002	and walk in the way of love , just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God .
49005003	But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality , or of any kind of impurity , or of greed , because these are improper for God's holy people .
49005004	Nor should there be obscenity , foolish talk or coarse joking , which are out of place , but rather thanksgiving .
49005005	For of this you can be sure : No immoral , impure or greedy person — such a person is an idolater — has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
49005006	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient .
49005007	Therefore do not be partners with them .
49005008	For you were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Live as children of light
49005009	( for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness , righteousness and truth )
49005010	and find out what pleases the Lord .
49005011	Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness , but rather expose them .
49005012	It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret .
49005013	But everything exposed by the light becomes visible — and everything that is illuminated becomes a light .
49005014	This is why it is said :
49005016	making the most of every opportunity , because the days are evil .
49005017	Therefore do not be foolish , but understand what the Lord's will is .
49005018	Do not get drunk on wine , which leads to debauchery . Instead , be filled with the Spirit ,
49005019	speaking to one another with psalms , hymns , and songs from the Spirit . Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord ,
49005020	always giving thanks to God the Father for everything , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
49005021	Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ .
49005022	Wives , submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord .
49005023	For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church , his body , of which he is the Savior .
49005024	Now as the church submits to Christ , so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything .
49005025	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
49005026	to make her holy , cleansing her by the washing with water through the word ,
49005027	and to present her to himself as a radiant church , without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish , but holy and blameless .
49005028	In this same way , husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself .
49005029	After all , no one ever hated their own body , but they feed and care for their body , just as Christ does the church —
49005030	for we are members of his body .
49005031	" For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and the two will become one flesh . "
49005032	This is a profound mystery — but I am talking about Christ and the church .
49005033	However , each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband .
49006001	Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right .
49006002	" Honor your father and mother " — which is the first commandment with a promise —
49006003	" so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth . "
49006004	Fathers , do not exasperate your children ; instead , bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord .
49006005	Slaves , obey your earthly masters with respect and fear , and with sincerity of heart , just as you would obey Christ .
49006006	Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from your heart .
49006007	Serve wholeheartedly , as if you were serving the Lord , not people ,
49006008	because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do , whether they are slave or free .
49006009	And masters , treat your slaves in the same way . Do not threaten them , since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no favoritism with him .
49006010	Finally , be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power .
49006011	Put on the full armor of God , so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes .
49006012	For our struggle is not against flesh and blood , but against the rulers , against the authorities , against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms .
49006013	Therefore put on the full armor of God , so that when the day of evil comes , you may be able to stand your ground , and after you have done everything , to stand .
49006014	Stand firm then , with the belt of truth buckled around your waist , with the breastplate of righteousness in place ,
49006015	and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace .
49006016	In addition to all this , take up the shield of faith , with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
49006017	Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
49006018	And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests . With this in mind , be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people .
49006019	Pray also for me , that whenever I speak , words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel ,
49006020	for which I am an ambassador in chains . Pray that I may declare it fearlessly , as I should .
49006021	Tychicus , the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will tell you everything , so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing .
49006022	I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are , and that he may encourage you .
49006023	Peace to the brothers and sisters , and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
49006024	Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love .
50001001	Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus , To all God's holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi , together with the overseers and deacons :
50001002	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
50001003	I thank my God every time I remember you .
50001004	In all my prayers for all of you , I always pray with joy
50001005	because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now ,
50001006	being confident of this , that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus .
50001007	It is right for me to feel this way about all of you , since I have you in my heart and , whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel , all of you share in God's grace with me .
50001008	God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus .
50001009	And this is my prayer : that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight ,
50001010	so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ ,
50001011	filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ — to the glory and praise of God .
50001012	Now I want you to know , brothers and sisters , that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel .
50001013	As a result , it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ .
50001014	And because of my chains , most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear .
50001015	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry , but others out of goodwill .
50001016	The latter do so out of love , knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel .
50001017	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition , not sincerely , supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains .
50001018	But what does it matter ? The important thing is that in every way , whether from false motives or true , Christ is preached . And because of this I rejoice . Yes , and I will continue to rejoice ,
50001019	for I know that through your prayers and God's provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance .
50001020	I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed , but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body , whether by life or by death .
50001021	For to me , to live is Christ and to die is gain .
50001022	If I am to go on living in the body , this will mean fruitful labor for me . Yet what shall I choose ? I do not know !
50001023	I am torn between the two : I desire to depart and be with Christ , which is better by far ;
50001024	but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body .
50001025	Convinced of this , I know that I will remain , and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith ,
50001026	so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me .
50001027	Whatever happens , conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ . Then , whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence , I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit , striving together as one for the faith of the gospel
50001028	without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you . This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed , but that you will be saved — and that by God .
50001029	For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him , but also to suffer for him ,
50001030	since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had , and now hear that I still have .
50002001	Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ , if any comfort from his love , if any common sharing in the Spirit , if any tenderness and compassion ,
50002002	then make my joy complete by being like-minded , having the same love , being one in spirit and of one mind .
50002003	Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit . Rather , in humility value others above yourselves ,
50002004	not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others .
50002005	In your relationships with one another , have the same mindset as Christ Jesus :
50002006	Who , being in very nature God ,
50002007	rather , he made himself nothing
50002008	And being found in appearance as a man ,
50002009	Therefore God exalted him to the highest place
50002010	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow ,
50002011	and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord ,
50002012	Therefore , my dear friends , as you have always obeyed — not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence — continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling ,
50002013	for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose .
50002014	Do everything without grumbling or arguing ,
50002015	so that you may become blameless and pure , " children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation . " Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky
50002016	as you hold firmly to the word of life . And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain .
50002017	But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith , I am glad and rejoice with all of you .
50002018	So you too should be glad and rejoice with me .
50002019	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you .
50002020	I have no one else like him , who will show genuine concern for your welfare .
50002021	For everyone looks out for their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ .
50002022	But you know that Timothy has proved himself , because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel .
50002023	I hope , therefore , to send him as soon as I see how things go with me .
50002024	And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon .
50002025	But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus , my brother , co-worker and fellow soldier , who is also your messenger , whom you sent to take care of my needs .
50002026	For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill .
50002027	Indeed he was ill , and almost died . But God had mercy on him , and not on him only but also on me , to spare me sorrow upon sorrow .
50002028	Therefore I am all the more eager to send him , so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety .
50002029	So then , welcome him in the Lord with great joy , and honor people like him ,
50002030	because he almost died for the work of Christ . He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me .
50003001	Further , my brothers and sisters , rejoice in the Lord ! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again , and it is a safeguard for you .
50003002	Watch out for those dogs , those evildoers , those mutilators of the flesh .
50003003	For it is we who are the circumcision , we who serve God by his Spirit , who boast in Christ Jesus , and who put no confidence in the flesh —
50003004	though I myself have reasons for such confidence . If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh , I have more :
50003005	circumcised on the eighth day , of the people of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews ; in regard to the law , a Pharisee ;
50003006	as for zeal , persecuting the church ; as for righteousness based on the law , faultless .
50003007	But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ .
50003008	What is more , I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord , for whose sake I have lost all things . I consider them garbage , that I may gain Christ
50003009	and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law , but that which is through faith in Christ — the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith .
50003010	I want to know Christ — yes , to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings , becoming like him in his death ,
50003011	and so , somehow , attaining to the resurrection from the dead .
50003012	Not that I have already obtained all this , or have already arrived at my goal , but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me .
50003013	Brothers and sisters , I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it . But one thing I do : Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead ,
50003014	I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus .
50003015	All of us , then , who are mature should take such a view of things . And if on some point you think differently , that too God will make clear to you .
50003016	Only let us live up to what we have already attained .
50003017	Join together in following my example , brothers and sisters , and just as you have us as a model , keep your eyes on those who live as we do .
50003018	For , as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears , many live as enemies of the cross of Christ .
50003019	Their destiny is destruction , their god is their stomach , and their glory is in their shame . Their mind is set on earthly things .
50003020	But our citizenship is in heaven . And we eagerly await a Savior from there , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
50003021	who , by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control , will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body .
50004001	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , you whom I love and long for , my joy and crown , stand firm in the Lord in this way , dear friends !
50004002	I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord .
50004003	Yes , and I ask you , my true companion , help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel , along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers , whose names are in the book of life .
50004004	Rejoice in the Lord always . I will say it again : Rejoice !
50004005	Let your gentleness be evident to all . The Lord is near .
50004006	Do not be anxious about anything , but in every situation , by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving , present your requests to God .
50004007	And the peace of God , which transcends all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .
50004008	Finally , brothers and sisters , whatever is true , whatever is noble , whatever is right , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely , whatever is admirable — if anything is excellent or praiseworthy — think about such things .
50004009	Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me , or seen in me — put it into practice . And the God of peace will be with you .
50004010	I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me . Indeed , you were concerned , but you had no opportunity to show it .
50004011	I am not saying this because I am in need , for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances .
50004012	I know what it is to be in need , and I know what it is to have plenty . I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want .
50004013	I can do all this through him who gives me strength .
50004014	Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles .
50004015	Moreover , as you Philippians know , in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel , when I set out from Macedonia , not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving , except you only ;
50004016	for even when I was in Thessalonica , you sent me aid more than once when I was in need .
50004017	Not that I desire your gifts ; what I desire is that more be credited to your account .
50004018	I have received full payment and have more than enough . I am amply supplied , now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent . They are a fragrant offering , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
50004019	And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus .
50004020	To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
50004021	Greet all God's people in Christ Jesus . The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings .
50004022	All God's people here send you greetings , especially those who belong to Caesar's household .
50004023	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
51001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother ,
51001002	To God's holy people in Colossae , the faithful brothers and sisters in Christ : Grace and peace to you from God our Father .
51001003	We always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , when we pray for you ,
51001004	because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God's people —
51001005	the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel
51001006	that has come to you . In the same way , the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world — just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God's grace .
51001007	You learned it from Epaphras , our dear fellow servant , who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf ,
51001008	and who also told us of your love in the Spirit .
51001009	For this reason , since the day we heard about you , we have not stopped praying for you . We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives ,
51001010	so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way : bearing fruit in every good work , growing in the knowledge of God ,
51001011	being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience ,
51001012	and giving joyful thanks to the Father , who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light .
51001013	For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves ,
51001014	in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins .
51001015	The Son is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn over all creation .
51001016	For in him all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things have been created through him and for him .
51001017	He is before all things , and in him all things hold together .
51001018	And he is the head of the body , the church ; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead , so that in everything he might have the supremacy .
51001019	For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him ,
51001020	and through him to reconcile to himself all things , whether things on earth or things in heaven , by making peace through his blood , shed on the cross .
51001021	Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior .
51001022	But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight , without blemish and free from accusation —
51001023	if you continue in your faith , established and firm , and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel . This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven , and of which I , Paul , have become a servant .
51001024	Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you , and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions , for the sake of his body , which is the church .
51001025	I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness —
51001026	the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations , but is now disclosed to the Lord's people .
51001027	To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory .
51001028	He is the one we proclaim , admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom , so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ .
51001029	To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me .
51002001	I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea , and for all who have not met me personally .
51002002	My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love , so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding , in order that they may know the mystery of God , namely , Christ ,
51002003	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
51002004	I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments .
51002005	For though I am absent from you in body , I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is .
51002006	So then , just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord , continue to live your lives in him ,
51002007	rooted and built up in him , strengthened in the faith as you were taught , and overflowing with thankfulness .
51002008	See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy , which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ .
51002009	For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form ,
51002010	and in Christ you have been brought to fullness . He is the head over every power and authority .
51002011	In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands . Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ ,
51002012	having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
51002013	When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh , God made you alive with Christ . He forgave us all our sins ,
51002014	having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness , which stood against us and condemned us ; he has taken it away , nailing it to the cross .
51002015	And having disarmed the powers and authorities , he made a public spectacle of them , triumphing over them by the cross .
51002016	Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink , or with regard to a religious festival , a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day .
51002017	These are a shadow of the things that were to come ; the reality , however , is found in Christ .
51002018	Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you . Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen ; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind .
51002019	They have lost connection with the head , from whom the whole body , supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews , grows as God causes it to grow .
51002020	Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world , why , as though you still belonged to the world , do you submit to its rules :
51002021	" Do not handle ! Do not taste ! Do not touch ! " ?
51002022	These rules , which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use , are based on merely human commands and teachings .
51002023	Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom , with their self-imposed worship , their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body , but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence .
51003001	Since , then , you have been raised with Christ , set your hearts on things above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God .
51003002	Set your minds on things above , not on earthly things .
51003003	For you died , and your life is now hidden with Christ in God .
51003004	When Christ , who is your life , appears , then you also will appear with him in glory .
51003005	Put to death , therefore , whatever belongs to your earthly nature : sexual immorality , impurity , lust , evil desires and greed , which is idolatry .
51003006	Because of these , the wrath of God is coming .
51003007	You used to walk in these ways , in the life you once lived .
51003008	But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these : anger , rage , malice , slander , and filthy language from your lips .
51003009	Do not lie to each other , since you have taken off your old self with its practices
51003010	and have put on the new self , which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator .
51003011	Here there is no Gentile or Jew , circumcised or uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave or free , but Christ is all , and is in all .
51003012	Therefore , as God's chosen people , holy and dearly loved , clothe yourselves with compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness and patience .
51003013	Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone . Forgive as the Lord forgave you .
51003014	And over all these virtues put on love , which binds them all together in perfect unity .
51003015	Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts , since as members of one body you were called to peace . And be thankful .
51003016	Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms , hymns , and songs from the Spirit , singing to God with gratitude in your hearts .
51003017	And whatever you do , whether in word or deed , do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through him .
51003018	Wives , submit yourselves to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord .
51003019	Husbands , love your wives and do not be harsh with them .
51003020	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this pleases the Lord .
51003021	Fathers , do not embitter your children , or they will become discouraged .
51003022	Slaves , obey your earthly masters in everything ; and do it , not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor , but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord .
51003023	Whatever you do , work at it with all your heart , as working for the Lord , not for human masters ,
51003024	since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward . It is the Lord Christ you are serving .
51003025	Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs , and there is no favoritism .
51004001	Masters , provide your slaves with what is right and fair , because you know that you also have a Master in heaven .
51004002	Devote yourselves to prayer , being watchful and thankful .
51004003	And pray for us , too , that God may open a door for our message , so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ , for which I am in chains .
51004004	Pray that I may proclaim it clearly , as I should .
51004005	Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders ; make the most of every opportunity .
51004006	Let your conversation be always full of grace , seasoned with salt , so that you may know how to answer everyone .
51004007	Tychicus will tell you all the news about me . He is a dear brother , a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord .
51004008	I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts .
51004009	He is coming with Onesimus , our faithful and dear brother , who is one of you . They will tell you everything that is happening here .
51004010	My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings , as does Mark , the cousin of Barnabas . ( You have received instructions about him ; if he comes to you , welcome him . )
51004011	Jesus , who is called Justus , also sends greetings . These are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God , and they have proved a comfort to me .
51004012	Epaphras , who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus , sends greetings . He is always wrestling in prayer for you , that you may stand firm in all the will of God , mature and fully assured .
51004013	I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis .
51004014	Our dear friend Luke , the doctor , and Demas send greetings .
51004015	Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea , and to Nympha and the church in her house .
51004016	After this letter has been read to you , see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea .
51004017	Tell Archippus : " See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord . "
51004018	I , Paul , write this greeting in my own hand . Remember my chains . Grace be with you .
52001001	Paul , Silas and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace and peace to you .
52001002	We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers .
52001003	We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith , your labor prompted by love , and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ .
52001004	For we know , brothers and sisters loved by God , that he has chosen you ,
52001005	because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power , with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction . You know how we lived among you for your sake .
52001006	You became imitators of us and of the Lord , for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit .
52001007	And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia .
52001008	The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia — your faith in God has become known everywhere . Therefore we do not need to say anything about it ,
52001009	for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us . They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ,
52001010	and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead — Jesus , who rescues us from the coming wrath .
52002001	You know , brothers and sisters , that our visit to you was not without results .
52002002	We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi , as you know , but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition .
52002003	For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives , nor are we trying to trick you .
52002004	On the contrary , we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel . We are not trying to please people but God , who tests our hearts .
52002005	You know we never used flattery , nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed — God is our witness .
52002006	We were not looking for praise from people , not from you or anyone else , even though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority .
52002007	Instead , we were like young children among you . Just as a nursing mother cares for her children ,
52002008	so we cared for you . Because we loved you so much , we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well .
52002009	Surely you remember , brothers and sisters , our toil and hardship ; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you .
52002010	You are witnesses , and so is God , of how holy , righteous and blameless we were among you who believed .
52002011	For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children ,
52002012	encouraging , comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God , who calls you into his kingdom and glory .
52002013	And we also thank God continually because , when you received the word of God , which you heard from us , you accepted it not as a human word , but as it actually is , the word of God , which is indeed at work in you who believe .
52002014	For you , brothers and sisters , became imitators of God's churches in Judea , which are in Christ Jesus : You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews
52002015	who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out . They displease God and are hostile to everyone
52002016	in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved . In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit . The wrath of God has come upon them at last .
52002017	But , brothers and sisters , when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time ( in person , not in thought ) , out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you .
52002018	For we wanted to come to you — certainly I , Paul , did , again and again — but Satan blocked our way .
52002019	For what is our hope , our joy , or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes ? Is it not you ?
52002020	Indeed , you are our glory and joy .
52003001	So when we could stand it no longer , we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens .
52003002	We sent Timothy , who is our brother and co-worker in God's service in spreading the gospel of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you in your faith ,
52003003	so that no one would be unsettled by these trials . For you know quite well that we are destined for them .
52003004	In fact , when we were with you , we kept telling you that we would be persecuted . And it turned out that way , as you well know .
52003005	For this reason , when I could stand it no longer , I sent to find out about your faith . I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain .
52003006	But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love . He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us , just as we also long to see you .
52003007	Therefore , brothers and sisters , in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith .
52003008	For now we really live , since you are standing firm in the Lord .
52003009	How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you ?
52003010	Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith .
52003011	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you .
52003012	May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else , just as ours does for you .
52003013	May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones .
52004001	As for other matters , brothers and sisters , we instructed you how to live in order to please God , as in fact you are living . Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more .
52004002	For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus .
52004003	It is God's will that you should be sanctified : that you should avoid sexual immorality ;
52004004	that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable ,
52004005	not in passionate lust like the pagans , who do not know God ;
52004006	and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister . The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins , as we told you and warned you before .
52004007	For God did not call us to be impure , but to live a holy life .
52004008	Therefore , anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God , the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit .
52004009	Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you , for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other .
52004010	And in fact , you do love all of God's family throughout Macedonia . Yet we urge you , brothers and sisters , to do so more and more ,
52004011	and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life : You should mind your own business and work with your hands , just as we told you ,
52004012	so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody .
52004013	Brothers and sisters , we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death , so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind , who have no hope .
52004014	For we believe that Jesus died and rose again , and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him .
52004015	According to the Lord's word , we tell you that we who are still alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep .
52004016	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven , with a loud command , with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God , and the dead in Christ will rise first .
52004017	After that , we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . And so we will be with the Lord forever .
52004018	Therefore encourage one another with these words .
52005001	Now , brothers and sisters , about times and dates we do not need to write to you ,
52005002	for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night .
52005003	While people are saying , " Peace and safety , " destruction will come on them suddenly , as labor pains on a pregnant woman , and they will not escape .
52005004	But you , brothers and sisters , are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief .
52005005	You are all children of the light and children of the day . We do not belong to the night or to the darkness .
52005006	So then , let us not be like others , who are asleep , but let us be awake and sober .
52005007	For those who sleep , sleep at night , and those who get drunk , get drunk at night .
52005008	But since we belong to the day , let us be sober , putting on faith and love as a breastplate , and the hope of salvation as a helmet .
52005009	For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005010	He died for us so that , whether we are awake or asleep , we may live together with him .
52005011	Therefore encourage one another and build each other up , just as in fact you are doing .
52005012	Now we ask you , brothers and sisters , to acknowledge those who work hard among you , who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you .
52005013	Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work . Live in peace with each other .
52005014	And we urge you , brothers and sisters , warn those who are idle and disruptive , encourage the disheartened , help the weak , be patient with everyone .
52005015	Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong , but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else .
52005016	Rejoice always ,
52005017	pray continually ,
52005018	give thanks in all circumstances ; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus .
52005019	Do not quench the Spirit .
52005020	Do not treat prophecies with contempt
52005021	but test them all ; hold on to what is good ,
52005022	reject every kind of evil .
52005023	May God himself , the God of peace , sanctify you through and through . May your whole spirit , soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
52005024	The one who calls you is faithful , and he will do it .
52005025	Brothers and sisters , pray for us .
52005026	Greet all God's people with a holy kiss .
52005027	I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters .
52005028	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
53001001	Paul , Silas and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
53001002	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53001003	We ought always to thank God for you , brothers and sisters , and rightly so , because your faith is growing more and more , and the love all of you have for one another is increasing .
53001004	Therefore , among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring .
53001005	All this is evidence that God's judgment is right , and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you are suffering .
53001006	God is just : He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
53001007	and give relief to you who are troubled , and to us as well . This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels .
53001008	He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus .
53001009	They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might
53001010	on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed . This includes you , because you believed our testimony to you .
53001011	With this in mind , we constantly pray for you , that our God may make you worthy of his calling , and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith .
53001012	We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
53002001	Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him , we ask you , brothers and sisters ,
53002002	not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us — whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter — asserting that the day of the Lord has already come .
53002003	Don't let anyone deceive you in any way , for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the man doomed to destruction .
53002004	He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped , so that he sets himself up in God's temple , proclaiming himself to be God .
53002005	Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things ?
53002006	And now you know what is holding him back , so that he may be revealed at the proper time .
53002007	For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work ; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way .
53002008	And then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming .
53002009	The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works . He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie ,
53002010	and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing . They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved .
53002011	For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie
53002012	and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness .
53002013	But we ought always to thank God for you , brothers and sisters loved by the Lord , because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth .
53002014	He called you to this through our gospel , that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
53002015	So then , brothers and sisters , stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you , whether by word of mouth or by letter .
53002016	May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father , who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope ,
53002017	encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word .
53003001	As for other matters , brothers and sisters , pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored , just as it was with you .
53003002	And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people , for not everyone has faith .
53003003	But the Lord is faithful , and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one .
53003004	We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command .
53003005	May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance .
53003006	In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , we command you , brothers and sisters , to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us .
53003007	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example . We were not idle when we were with you ,
53003008	nor did we eat anyone's food without paying for it . On the contrary , we worked night and day , laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you .
53003009	We did this , not because we do not have the right to such help , but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate .
53003010	For even when we were with you , we gave you this rule : " The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat . "
53003011	We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive . They are not busy ; they are busybodies .
53003012	Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat .
53003013	And as for you , brothers and sisters , never tire of doing what is good .
53003014	Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter . Do not associate with them , in order that they may feel ashamed .
53003015	Yet do not regard them as an enemy , but warn them as you would a fellow believer .
53003016	Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way . The Lord be with all of you .
53003017	I , Paul , write this greeting in my own hand , which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters . This is how I write .
53003018	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
54001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope ,
54001002	To Timothy my true son in the faith : Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
54001003	As I urged you when I went into Macedonia , stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer
54001004	or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies . Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God's work — which is by faith .
54001005	The goal of this command is love , which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .
54001006	Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk .
54001007	They want to be teachers of the law , but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm .
54001008	We know that the law is good if one uses it properly .
54001009	We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels , the ungodly and sinful , the unholy and irreligious , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers ,
54001010	for the sexually immoral , for those practicing homosexuality , for slave traders and liars and perjurers — and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine
54001011	that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God , which he entrusted to me .
54001012	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has given me strength , that he considered me trustworthy , appointing me to his service .
54001013	Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man , I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief .
54001014	The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly , along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus .
54001015	Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance : Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners — of whom I am the worst .
54001016	But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me , the worst of sinners , Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life .
54001017	Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
54001018	Timothy , my son , I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you , so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well ,
54001019	holding on to faith and a good conscience , which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith .
54001020	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme .
54002001	I urge , then , first of all , that petitions , prayers , intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people —
54002002	for kings and all those in authority , that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness .
54002003	This is good , and pleases God our Savior ,
54002004	who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth .
54002005	For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind , the man Christ Jesus ,
54002006	who gave himself as a ransom for all people . This has now been witnessed to at the proper time .
54002007	And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle — I am telling the truth , I am not lying — and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles .
54002008	Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray , lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing .
54002009	I also want the women to dress modestly , with decency and propriety , adorning themselves , not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes ,
54002010	but with good deeds , appropriate for women who profess to worship God .
54002011	A woman should learn in quietness and full submission .
54002012	I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man ; she must be quiet .
54002013	For Adam was formed first , then Eve .
54002014	And Adam was not the one deceived ; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner .
54002015	But women will be saved through childbearing — if they continue in faith , love and holiness with propriety .
54003001	Here is a trustworthy saying : Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task .
54003002	Now the overseer is to be above reproach , faithful to his wife , temperate , self-controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach ,
54003003	not given to drunkenness , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money .
54003004	He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him , and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect .
54003005	( If anyone does not know how to manage his own family , how can he take care of God's church ? )
54003006	He must not be a recent convert , or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil .
54003007	He must also have a good reputation with outsiders , so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap .
54003008	In the same way , deacons are to be worthy of respect , sincere , not indulging in much wine , and not pursuing dishonest gain .
54003009	They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience .
54003010	They must first be tested ; and then if there is nothing against them , let them serve as deacons .
54003011	In the same way , the women are to be worthy of respect , not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything .
54003012	A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well .
54003013	Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus .
54003014	Although I hope to come to you soon , I am writing you these instructions so that ,
54003015	if I am delayed , you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and foundation of the truth .
54003016	Beyond all question , the mystery from which true godliness springs is great :
54004001	The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons .
54004002	Such teachings come through hypocritical liars , whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron .
54004003	They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods , which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth .
54004004	For everything God created is good , and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving ,
54004005	because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer .
54004006	If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters , you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed .
54004007	Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales ; rather , train yourself to be godly .
54004008	For physical training is of some value , but godliness has value for all things , holding promise for both the present life and the life to come .
54004009	This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance .
54004010	That is why we labor and strive , because we have put our hope in the living God , who is the Savior of all people , and especially of those who believe .
54004011	Command and teach these things .
54004012	Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young , but set an example for the believers in speech , in conduct , in love , in faith and in purity .
54004013	Until I come , devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture , to preaching and to teaching .
54004014	Do not neglect your gift , which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you .
54004015	Be diligent in these matters ; give yourself wholly to them , so that everyone may see your progress .
54004016	Watch your life and doctrine closely . Persevere in them , because if you do , you will save both yourself and your hearers .
54005001	Do not rebuke an older man harshly , but exhort him as if he were your father . Treat younger men as brothers ,
54005002	older women as mothers , and younger women as sisters , with absolute purity .
54005003	Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need .
54005004	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents , for this is pleasing to God .
54005005	The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help .
54005006	But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives .
54005007	Give the people these instructions , so that no one may be open to blame .
54005008	Anyone who does not provide for their relatives , and especially for their own household , has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
54005009	No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty , has been faithful to her husband ,
54005010	and is well known for her good deeds , such as bringing up children , showing hospitality , washing the feet of the Lord's people , helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds .
54005011	As for younger widows , do not put them on such a list . For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ , they want to marry .
54005012	Thus they bring judgment on themselves , because they have broken their first pledge .
54005013	Besides , they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house . And not only do they become idlers , but also busybodies who talk nonsense , saying things they ought not to .
54005014	So I counsel younger widows to marry , to have children , to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander .
54005015	Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan .
54005016	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care , she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them , so that the church can help those widows who are really in need .
54005017	The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor , especially those whose work is preaching and teaching .
54005018	For Scripture says , " Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain , " and " The worker deserves his wages . "
54005019	Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses .
54005020	But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone , so that the others may take warning .
54005021	I charge you , in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels , to keep these instructions without partiality , and to do nothing out of favoritism .
54005022	Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands , and do not share in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
54005023	Stop drinking only water , and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses .
54005024	The sins of some are obvious , reaching the place of judgment ahead of them ; the sins of others trail behind them .
54005025	In the same way , good deeds are obvious , and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever .
54006001	All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect , so that God's name and our teaching may not be slandered .
54006002	Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers . Instead , they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves . These are the things you are to teach and insist on .
54006003	If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching ,
54006004	they are conceited and understand nothing . They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy , strife , malicious talk , evil suspicions
54006005	and constant friction between people of corrupt mind , who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain .
54006006	But godliness with contentment is great gain .
54006007	For we brought nothing into the world , and we can take nothing out of it .
54006008	But if we have food and clothing , we will be content with that .
54006009	Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction .
54006010	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . Some people , eager for money , have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs .
54006011	But you , man of God , flee from all this , and pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , endurance and gentleness .
54006012	Fight the good fight of the faith . Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses .
54006013	In the sight of God , who gives life to everything , and of Christ Jesus , who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession , I charge you
54006014	to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
54006015	which God will bring about in his own time — God , the blessed and only Ruler , the King of kings and Lord of lords ,
54006016	who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light , whom no one has seen or can see . To him be honor and might forever . Amen .
54006017	Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth , which is so uncertain , but to put their hope in God , who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment .
54006018	Command them to do good , to be rich in good deeds , and to be generous and willing to share .
54006019	In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age , so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life .
54006020	Timothy , guard what has been entrusted to your care . Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge ,
54006021	which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith . Grace be with you all .
55001001	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus ,
55001002	To Timothy , my dear son : Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
55001003	I thank God , whom I serve , as my ancestors did , with a clear conscience , as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers .
55001004	Recalling your tears , I long to see you , so that I may be filled with joy .
55001005	I am reminded of your sincere faith , which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and , I am persuaded , now lives in you also .
55001006	For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God , which is in you through the laying on of my hands .
55001007	For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid , but gives us power , love and self-discipline .
55001008	So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner . Rather , join with me in suffering for the gospel , by the power of God .
55001009	He has saved us and called us to a holy life — not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace . This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time ,
55001010	but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior , Christ Jesus , who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel .
55001011	And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher .
55001012	That is why I am suffering as I am . Yet this is no cause for shame , because I know whom I have believed , and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day .
55001013	What you heard from me , keep as the pattern of sound teaching , with faith and love in Christ Jesus .
55001014	Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you — guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us .
55001015	You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me , including Phygelus and Hermogenes .
55001016	May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus , because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains .
55001017	On the contrary , when he was in Rome , he searched hard for me until he found me .
55001018	May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day ! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus .
55002001	You then , my son , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
55002002	And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others .
55002003	Join with me in suffering , like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
55002004	No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs , but rather tries to please his commanding officer .
55002005	Similarly , anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor's crown except by competing according to the rules .
55002006	The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops .
55002007	Reflect on what I am saying , for the Lord will give you insight into all this .
55002008	Remember Jesus Christ , raised from the dead , descended from David . This is my gospel ,
55002009	for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal . But God's word is not chained .
55002010	Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect , that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus , with eternal glory .
55002011	Here is a trustworthy saying :
55002012	if we endure ,
55002013	if we are faithless ,
55002014	Keep reminding God's people of these things . Warn them before God against quarreling about words ; it is of no value , and only ruins those who listen .
55002015	Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved , a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth .
55002016	Avoid godless chatter , because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly .
55002017	Their teaching will spread like gangrene . Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
55002018	who have departed from the truth . They say that the resurrection has already taken place , and they destroy the faith of some .
55002019	Nevertheless , God's solid foundation stands firm , sealed with this inscription : " The Lord knows those who are his , " and , " Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness . "
55002020	In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver , but also of wood and clay ; some are for special purposes and some for common use .
55002021	Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes , made holy , useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work .
55002022	Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness , faith , love and peace , along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
55002023	Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments , because you know they produce quarrels .
55002024	And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone , able to teach , not resentful .
55002025	Opponents must be gently instructed , in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth ,
55002026	and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil , who has taken them captive to do his will .
55003001	But mark this : There will be terrible times in the last days .
55003002	People will be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , boastful , proud , abusive , disobedient to their parents , ungrateful , unholy ,
55003003	without love , unforgiving , slanderous , without self-control , brutal , not lovers of the good ,
55003004	treacherous , rash , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God —
55003005	having a form of godliness but denying its power . Have nothing to do with such people .
55003006	They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women , who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires ,
55003007	always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth .
55003008	Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so also these teachers oppose the truth . They are men of depraved minds , who , as far as the faith is concerned , are rejected .
55003009	But they will not get very far because , as in the case of those men , their folly will be clear to everyone .
55003010	You , however , know all about my teaching , my way of life , my purpose , faith , patience , love , endurance ,
55003011	persecutions , sufferings — what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch , Iconium and Lystra , the persecutions I endured . Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them .
55003012	In fact , everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted ,
55003013	while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse , deceiving and being deceived .
55003014	But as for you , continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of , because you know those from whom you learned it ,
55003015	and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures , which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
55003016	All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching , rebuking , correcting and training in righteousness ,
55003017	so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work .
55004001	In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , who will judge the living and the dead , and in view of his appearing and his kingdom , I give you this charge :
55004002	Preach the word ; be prepared in season and out of season ; correct , rebuke and encourage — with great patience and careful instruction .
55004003	For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine . Instead , to suit their own desires , they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear .
55004004	They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths .
55004005	But you , keep your head in all situations , endure hardship , do the work of an evangelist , discharge all the duties of your ministry .
55004006	For I am already being poured out like a drink offering , and the time for my departure is near .
55004007	I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith .
55004008	Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will award to me on that day — and not only to me , but also to all who have longed for his appearing .
55004009	Do your best to come to me quickly ,
55004010	for Demas , because he loved this world , has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica . Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia .
55004011	Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , because he is helpful to me in my ministry .
55004012	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus .
55004013	When you come , bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas , and my scrolls , especially the parchments .
55004014	Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm . The Lord will repay him for what he has done .
55004015	You too should be on your guard against him , because he strongly opposed our message .
55004016	At my first defense , no one came to my support , but everyone deserted me . May it not be held against them .
55004017	But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength , so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it . And I was delivered from the lion's mouth .
55004018	The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom . To him be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
55004019	Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus .
55004020	Erastus stayed in Corinth , and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus .
55004021	Do your best to get here before winter . Eubulus greets you , and so do Pudens , Linus , Claudia and all the brothers and sisters .
55004022	The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you all .
56001001	Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness —
56001002	in the hope of eternal life , which God , who does not lie , promised before the beginning of time ,
56001003	and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior ,
56001004	To Titus , my true son in our common faith : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior .
56001005	The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town , as I directed you .
56001006	An elder must be blameless , faithful to his wife , a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient .
56001007	Since an overseer manages God's household , he must be blameless — not overbearing , not quick-tempered , not given to drunkenness , not violent , not pursuing dishonest gain .
56001008	Rather , he must be hospitable , one who loves what is good , who is self-controlled , upright , holy and disciplined .
56001009	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught , so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it .
56001010	For there are many rebellious people , full of meaningless talk and deception , especially those of the circumcision group .
56001011	They must be silenced , because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach — and that for the sake of dishonest gain .
56001012	One of Crete's own prophets has said it : " Cretans are always liars , evil brutes , lazy gluttons . "
56001013	This saying is true . Therefore rebuke them sharply , so that they will be sound in the faith
56001014	and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth .
56001015	To the pure , all things are pure , but to those who are corrupted and do not believe , nothing is pure . In fact , both their minds and consciences are corrupted .
56001016	They claim to know God , but by their actions they deny him . They are detestable , disobedient and unfit for doing anything good .
56002001	You , however , must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine .
56002002	Teach the older men to be temperate , worthy of respect , self-controlled , and sound in faith , in love and in endurance .
56002003	Likewise , teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live , not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine , but to teach what is good .
56002004	Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children ,
56002005	to be self-controlled and pure , to be busy at home , to be kind , and to be subject to their husbands , so that no one will malign the word of God .
56002006	Similarly , encourage the young men to be self-controlled .
56002007	In everything set them an example by doing what is good . In your teaching show integrity , seriousness
56002008	and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned , so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us .
56002009	Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything , to try to please them , not to talk back to them ,
56002010	and not to steal from them , but to show that they can be fully trusted , so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive .
56002011	For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people .
56002012	It teaches us to say " No " to ungodliness and worldly passions , and to live self-controlled , upright and godly lives in this present age ,
56002013	while we wait for the blessed hope — the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ ,
56002014	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own , eager to do what is good .
56002015	These , then , are the things you should teach . Encourage and rebuke with all authority . Do not let anyone despise you .
56003001	Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities , to be obedient , to be ready to do whatever is good ,
56003002	to slander no one , to be peaceable and considerate , and always to be gentle toward everyone .
56003003	At one time we too were foolish , disobedient , deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures . We lived in malice and envy , being hated and hating one another .
56003004	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared ,
56003005	he saved us , not because of righteous things we had done , but because of his mercy . He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit ,
56003006	whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
56003007	so that , having been justified by his grace , we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life .
56003008	This is a trustworthy saying . And I want you to stress these things , so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good . These things are excellent and profitable for everyone .
56003009	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law , because these are unprofitable and useless .
56003010	Warn a divisive person once , and then warn them a second time . After that , have nothing to do with them .
56003011	You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful ; they are self-condemned .
56003012	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you , do your best to come to me at Nicopolis , because I have decided to winter there .
56003013	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need .
56003014	Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good , in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives .
56003015	Everyone with me sends you greetings . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
57001001	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker —
57001002	also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier — and to the church that meets in your home :
57001003	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
57001004	I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers ,
57001005	because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus .
57001006	I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ .
57001007	Your love has given me great joy and encouragement , because you , brother , have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people .
57001008	Therefore , although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do ,
57001009	yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love . It is as none other than Paul — an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus —
57001010	that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus , who became my son while I was in chains .
57001011	Formerly he was useless to you , but now he has become useful both to you and to me .
57001012	I am sending him — who is my very heart — back to you .
57001013	I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel .
57001014	But I did not want to do anything without your consent , so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary .
57001015	Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever —
57001016	no longer as a slave , but better than a slave , as a dear brother . He is very dear to me but even dearer to you , both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord .
57001017	So if you consider me a partner , welcome him as you would welcome me .
57001018	If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything , charge it to me .
57001019	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand . I will pay it back — not to mention that you owe me your very self .
57001020	I do wish , brother , that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord ; refresh my heart in Christ .
57001021	Confident of your obedience , I write to you , knowing that you will do even more than I ask .
57001022	And one thing more : Prepare a guest room for me , because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers .
57001023	Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends you greetings .
57001024	And so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas and Luke , my fellow workers .
57001025	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
58001001	In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways ,
58001002	but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , and through whom also he made the universe .
58001003	The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being , sustaining all things by his powerful word . After he had provided purification for sins , he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven .
58001004	So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs .
58001005	For to which of the angels did God ever say ,
58001006	And again , when God brings his firstborn into the world , he says ,
58001007	In speaking of the angels he says ,
58001008	But about the Son he says ,
58001009	You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness ;
58001010	He also says ,
58001011	They will perish , but you remain ;
58001012	You will roll them up like a robe ;
58001013	To which of the angels did God ever say ,
58001014	Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation ?
58002001	We must pay the most careful attention , therefore , to what we have heard , so that we do not drift away .
58002002	For since the message spoken through angels was binding , and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment ,
58002003	how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation ? This salvation , which was first announced by the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard him .
58002004	God also testified to it by signs , wonders and various miracles , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will .
58002005	It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come , about which we are speaking .
58002006	But there is a place where someone has testified :
58002008	and put everything under their feet . " In putting everything under them , God left nothing that is not subject to them . Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them .
58002009	But we do see Jesus , who was made lower than the angels for a little while , now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death , so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone .
58002010	In bringing many sons and daughters to glory , it was fitting that God , for whom and through whom everything exists , should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered .
58002011	Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family . So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters .
58002012	He says ,
58002014	Since the children have flesh and blood , he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death — that is , the devil —
58002015	and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death .
58002016	For surely it is not angels he helps , but Abraham's descendants .
58002017	For this reason he had to be made like them , fully human in every way , in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God , and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people .
58002018	Because he himself suffered when he was tempted , he is able to help those who are being tempted .
58003001	Therefore , holy brothers and sisters , who share in the heavenly calling , fix your thoughts on Jesus , whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest .
58003002	He was faithful to the one who appointed him , just as Moses was faithful in all God's house .
58003003	Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses , just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself .
58003004	For every house is built by someone , but God is the builder of everything .
58003005	" Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house , " bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future .
58003006	But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house . And we are his house , if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory .
58003007	So , as the Holy Spirit says :
58003009	where your ancestors tested and tried me ,
58003010	That is why I was angry with that generation ;
58003011	So I declared on oath in my anger ,
58003012	See to it , brothers and sisters , that none of you has a sinful , unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God .
58003013	But encourage one another daily , as long as it is called " Today , " so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness .
58003014	We have come to share in Christ , if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end .
58003015	As has just been said :
58003017	And with whom was he angry for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose bodies perished in the wilderness ?
58003018	And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed ?
58003019	So we see that they were not able to enter , because of their unbelief .
58004001	Therefore , since the promise of entering his rest still stands , let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it .
58004002	For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us , just as they did ; but the message they heard was of no value to them , because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed .
58004003	Now we who have believed enter that rest , just as God has said ,
58004004	For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words : " On the seventh day God rested from all his works . "
58004005	And again in the passage above he says , " They shall never enter my rest . "
58004006	Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest , and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience ,
58004007	God again set a certain day , calling it " Today . " This he did when a long time later he spoke through David , as in the passage already quoted :
58004009	There remains , then , a Sabbath-rest for the people of God ;
58004010	for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works , just as God did from his .
58004011	Let us , therefore , make every effort to enter that rest , so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience .
58004012	For the word of God is alive and active . Sharper than any double-edged sword , it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit , joints and marrow ; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart .
58004013	Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight . Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account .
58004014	Therefore , since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold firmly to the faith we profess .
58004015	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses , but we have one who has been tempted in every way , just as we are — yet he did not sin .
58004016	Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence , so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need .
58005001	Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God , to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins .
58005002	He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray , since he himself is subject to weakness .
58005003	This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins , as well as for the sins of the people .
58005004	And no one takes this honor on himself , but he receives it when called by God , just as Aaron was .
58005005	In the same way , Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest . But God said to him ,
58005006	And he says in another place ,
58005007	During the days of Jesus' life on earth , he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death , and he was heard because of his reverent submission .
58005008	Son though he was , he learned obedience from what he suffered
58005009	and , once made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
58005010	and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek .
58005011	We have much to say about this , but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand .
58005012	In fact , though by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again . You need milk , not solid food !
58005013	Anyone who lives on milk , being still an infant , is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness .
58005014	But solid food is for the mature , who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil .
58006001	Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity , not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death , and of faith in God ,
58006002	instruction about cleansing rites , the laying on of hands , the resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment .
58006003	And God permitting , we will do so .
58006004	It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened , who have tasted the heavenly gift , who have shared in the Holy Spirit ,
58006005	who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age
58006006	and who have fallen away , to be brought back to repentance . To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace .
58006007	Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God .
58006008	But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed . In the end it will be burned .
58006009	Even though we speak like this , dear friends , we are convinced of better things in your case — the things that have to do with salvation .
58006010	God is not unjust ; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them .
58006011	We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end , so that what you hope for may be fully realized .
58006012	We do not want you to become lazy , but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised .
58006013	When God made his promise to Abraham , since there was no one greater for him to swear by , he swore by himself ,
58006014	saying , " I will surely bless you and give you many descendants . "
58006015	And so after waiting patiently , Abraham received what was promised .
58006016	People swear by someone greater than themselves , and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument .
58006017	Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised , he confirmed it with an oath .
58006018	God did this so that , by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged .
58006019	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul , firm and secure . It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain ,
58006020	where our forerunner , Jesus , has entered on our behalf . He has become a high priest forever , in the order of Melchizedek .
58007001	This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High . He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him ,
58007002	and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything . First , the name Melchizedek means " king of righteousness " ; then also , " king of Salem " means " king of peace . "
58007003	Without father or mother , without genealogy , without beginning of days or end of life , resembling the Son of God , he remains a priest forever .
58007004	Just think how great he was : Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder !
58007005	Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people — that is , from their fellow Israelites — even though they also are descended from Abraham .
58007006	This man , however , did not trace his descent from Levi , yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises .
58007007	And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater .
58007008	In the one case , the tenth is collected by people who die ; but in the other case , by him who is declared to be living .
58007009	One might even say that Levi , who collects the tenth , paid the tenth through Abraham ,
58007010	because when Melchizedek met Abraham , Levi was still in the body of his ancestor .
58007011	If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood — and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood — why was there still need for another priest to come , one in the order of Melchizedek , not in the order of Aaron ?
58007012	For when the priesthood is changed , the law must be changed also .
58007013	He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe , and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar .
58007014	For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah , and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests .
58007015	And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears ,
58007016	one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life .
58007017	For it is declared :
58007019	( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a better hope is introduced , by which we draw near to God .
58007020	And it was not without an oath ! Others became priests without any oath ,
58007021	but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him :
58007023	Now there have been many of those priests , since death prevented them from continuing in office ;
58007024	but because Jesus lives forever , he has a permanent priesthood .
58007025	Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him , because he always lives to intercede for them .
58007026	Such a high priest truly meets our need — one who is holy , blameless , pure , set apart from sinners , exalted above the heavens .
58007027	Unlike the other high priests , he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself .
58007028	For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness ; but the oath , which came after the law , appointed the Son , who has been made perfect forever .
58008001	Now the main point of what we are saying is this : We do have such a high priest , who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven ,
58008002	and who serves in the sanctuary , the true tabernacle set up by the Lord , not by a mere human being .
58008003	Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices , and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer .
58008004	If he were on earth , he would not be a priest , for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law .
58008005	They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven . This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle : " See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain . "
58008006	But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one , since the new covenant is established on better promises .
58008007	For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant , no place would have been sought for another .
58008008	But God found fault with the people and said :
58008010	This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel
58008011	No longer will they teach their neighbor ,
58008012	For I will forgive their wickedness
58008013	By calling this covenant " new , " he has made the first one obsolete ; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear .
58009001	Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary .
58009002	A tabernacle was set up . In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread ; this was called the Holy Place .
58009003	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place ,
58009004	which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant . This ark contained the gold jar of manna , Aaron's staff that had budded , and the stone tablets of the covenant .
58009005	Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory , overshadowing the atonement cover . But we cannot discuss these things in detail now .
58009006	When everything had been arranged like this , the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry .
58009007	But only the high priest entered the inner room , and that only once a year , and never without blood , which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance .
58009008	The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning .
58009009	This is an illustration for the present time , indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper .
58009010	They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings — external regulations applying until the time of the new order .
58009011	But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here , he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands , that is to say , is not a part of this creation .
58009012	He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves ; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood , thus obtaining eternal redemption .
58009013	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean .
58009014	How much more , then , will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God , cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death , so that we may serve the living God !
58009015	For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant , that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance — now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant .
58009016	In the case of a will , it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it ,
58009017	because a will is in force only when somebody has died ; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living .
58009018	This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood .
58009019	When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people , he took the blood of calves , together with water , scarlet wool and branches of hyssop , and sprinkled the scroll and all the people .
58009020	He said , " This is the blood of the covenant , which God has commanded you to keep . "
58009021	In the same way , he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies .
58009022	In fact , the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
58009023	It was necessary , then , for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
58009024	For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one ; he entered heaven itself , now to appear for us in God's presence .
58009025	Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again , the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own .
58009026	Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world . But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself .
58009027	Just as people are destined to die once , and after that to face judgment ,
58009028	so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many ; and he will appear a second time , not to bear sin , but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .
58010001	The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming — not the realities themselves . For this reason it can never , by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year , make perfect those who draw near to worship .
58010002	Otherwise , would they not have stopped being offered ? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all , and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins .
58010003	But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins .
58010004	It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
58010005	Therefore , when Christ came into the world , he said : " Sacrifice and offering you did not desire , but a body you prepared for me ;
58010006	with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased .
58010007	Then I said , ' Here I am — it is written about me in the scroll — I have come to do your will , my God . ' "
58010008	First he said , " Sacrifices and offerings , burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire , nor were you pleased with them " — though they were offered in accordance with the law .
58010009	Then he said , " Here I am , I have come to do your will . " He sets aside the first to establish the second .
58010010	And by that will , we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
58010011	Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties ; again and again he offers the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
58010012	But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins , he sat down at the right hand of God ,
58010013	and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool .
58010014	For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy .
58010015	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this . First he says :
58010016	" This is the covenant I will make with them after that time , says the Lord . I will put my laws in their hearts , and I will write them on their minds . "
58010017	Then he adds : " Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more . "
58010018	And where these have been forgiven , sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary .
58010019	Therefore , brothers and sisters , since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus ,
58010020	by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain , that is , his body ,
58010021	and since we have a great priest over the house of God ,
58010022	let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings , having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water .
58010023	Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess , for he who promised is faithful .
58010024	And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds ,
58010025	not giving up meeting together , as some are in the habit of doing , but encouraging one another — and all the more as you see the Day approaching .
58010026	If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth , no sacrifice for sins is left ,
58010027	but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God .
58010028	Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
58010029	How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot , who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them , and who has insulted the Spirit of grace ?
58010030	For we know him who said , " It is mine to avenge ; I will repay , " and again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
58010031	It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
58010032	Remember those earlier days after you had received the light , when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering .
58010033	Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution ; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated .
58010034	You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property , because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions .
58010035	So do not throw away your confidence ; it will be richly rewarded .
58010036	You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God , you will receive what he has promised .
58010037	For , " In just a little while , he who is coming will come and will not delay . "
58010038	And , " But my righteous one will live by faith . And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back . "
58010039	But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed , but to those who have faith and are saved .
58011001	Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see .
58011002	This is what the ancients were commended for .
58011003	By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command , so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible .
58011004	By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did . By faith he was commended as righteous , when God spoke well of his offerings . And by faith Abel still speaks , even though he is dead .
58011005	By faith Enoch was taken from this life , so that he did not experience death : " He could not be found , because God had taken him away . " For before he was taken , he was commended as one who pleased God .
58011006	And without faith it is impossible to please God , because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him .
58011007	By faith Noah , when warned about things not yet seen , in holy fear built an ark to save his family . By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith .
58011008	By faith Abraham , when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance , obeyed and went , even though he did not know where he was going .
58011009	By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country ; he lived in tents , as did Isaac and Jacob , who were heirs with him of the same promise .
58011010	For he was looking forward to the city with foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
58011011	And by faith even Sarah , who was past childbearing age , was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise .
58011012	And so from this one man , and he as good as dead , came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore .
58011013	All these people were still living by faith when they died . They did not receive the things promised ; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance , admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth .
58011014	People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own .
58011015	If they had been thinking of the country they had left , they would have had opportunity to return .
58011016	Instead , they were longing for a better country — a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them .
58011017	By faith Abraham , when God tested him , offered Isaac as a sacrifice . He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son ,
58011018	even though God had said to him , " It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned . "
58011019	Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead , and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death .
58011020	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future .
58011021	By faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of Joseph's sons , and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff .
58011022	By faith Joseph , when his end was near , spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones .
58011023	By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born , because they saw he was no ordinary child , and they were not afraid of the king's edict .
58011024	By faith Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter .
58011025	He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin .
58011026	He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt , because he was looking ahead to his reward .
58011027	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the king's anger ; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible .
58011028	By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood , so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel .
58011029	By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land ; but when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were drowned .
58011030	By faith the walls of Jericho fell , after the army had marched around them for seven days .
58011031	By faith the prostitute Rahab , because she welcomed the spies , was not killed with those who were disobedient .
58011032	And what more shall I say ? I do not have time to tell about Gideon , Barak , Samson and Jephthah , about David and Samuel and the prophets ,
58011033	who through faith conquered kingdoms , administered justice , and gained what was promised ; who shut the mouths of lions ,
58011034	quenched the fury of the flames , and escaped the edge of the sword ; whose weakness was turned to strength ; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies .
58011035	Women received back their dead , raised to life again . There were others who were tortured , refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection .
58011036	Some faced jeers and flogging , and even chains and imprisonment .
58011037	They were put to death by stoning ; they were sawed in two ; they were killed by the sword . They went about in sheepskins and goatskins , destitute , persecuted and mistreated —
58011038	the world was not worthy of them . They wandered in deserts and mountains , living in caves and in holes in the ground .
58011039	These were all commended for their faith , yet none of them received what had been promised ,
58011040	since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect .
58012001	Therefore , since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses , let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles . And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us ,
58012002	fixing our eyes on Jesus , the pioneer and perfecter of faith . For the joy set before him he endured the cross , scorning its shame , and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
58012003	Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners , so that you will not grow weary and lose heart .
58012004	In your struggle against sin , you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood .
58012005	And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son ? It says ,
58012007	Endure hardship as discipline ; God is treating you as his children . For what children are not disciplined by their father ?
58012008	If you are not disciplined — and everyone undergoes discipline — then you are not legitimate , not true sons and daughters at all .
58012009	Moreover , we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it . How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live !
58012010	They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best ; but God disciplines us for our good , in order that we may share in his holiness .
58012011	No discipline seems pleasant at the time , but painful . Later on , however , it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it .
58012012	Therefore , strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees .
58012013	" Make level paths for your feet , " so that the lame may not be disabled , but rather healed .
58012014	Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy ; without holiness no one will see the Lord .
58012015	See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many .
58012016	See that no one is sexually immoral , or is godless like Esau , who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son .
58012017	Afterward , as you know , when he wanted to inherit this blessing , he was rejected . Even though he sought the blessing with tears , he could not change what he had done .
58012018	You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire ; to darkness , gloom and storm ;
58012019	to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them ,
58012020	because they could not bear what was commanded : " If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned to death . "
58012021	The sight was so terrifying that Moses said , " I am trembling with fear . "
58012022	But you have come to Mount Zion , to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem . You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly ,
58012023	to the church of the firstborn , whose names are written in heaven . You have come to God , the Judge of all , to the spirits of the righteous made perfect ,
58012024	to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel .
58012025	See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks . If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth , how much less will we , if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven ?
58012026	At that time his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , " Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens . "
58012027	The words " once more " indicate the removing of what can be shaken — that is , created things — so that what cannot be shaken may remain .
58012028	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken , let us be thankful , and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe ,
58012029	for our " God is a consuming fire . "
58013001	Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters .
58013002	Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers , for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it .
58013003	Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison , and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering .
58013004	Marriage should be honored by all , and the marriage bed kept pure , for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral .
58013005	Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have , because God has said ,
58013007	Remember your leaders , who spoke the word of God to you . Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith .
58013008	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever .
58013009	Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings . It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace , not by eating ceremonial foods , which is of no benefit to those who do so .
58013010	We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat .
58013011	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering , but the bodies are burned outside the camp .
58013012	And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood .
58013013	Let us , then , go to him outside the camp , bearing the disgrace he bore .
58013014	For here we do not have an enduring city , but we are looking for the city that is to come .
58013015	Through Jesus , therefore , let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise — the fruit of lips that openly profess his name .
58013016	And do not forget to do good and to share with others , for with such sacrifices God is pleased .
58013017	Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority , because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account . Do this so that their work will be a joy , not a burden , for that would be of no benefit to you .
58013018	Pray for us . We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way .
58013019	I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon .
58013020	Now may the God of peace , who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great Shepherd of the sheep ,
58013021	equip you with everything good for doing his will , and may he work in us what is pleasing to him , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
58013022	Brothers and sisters , I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation , for in fact I have written to you quite briefly .
58013023	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released . If he arrives soon , I will come with him to see you .
58013024	Greet all your leaders and all the Lord's people . Those from Italy send you their greetings .
58013025	Grace be with you all .
59001001	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations : Greetings .
59001002	Consider it pure joy , my brothers and sisters , whenever you face trials of many kinds ,
59001003	because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance .
59001004	Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete , not lacking anything .
59001005	If any of you lacks wisdom , you should ask God , who gives generously to all without finding fault , and it will be given to you .
59001006	But when you ask , you must believe and not doubt , because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea , blown and tossed by the wind .
59001007	That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord .
59001008	Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do .
59001009	Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position .
59001010	But the rich should take pride in their humiliation — since they will pass away like a wild flower .
59001011	For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant ; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed . In the same way , the rich will fade away even while they go about their business .
59001012	Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because , having stood the test , that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him .
59001013	When tempted , no one should say , " God is tempting me . " For God cannot be tempted by evil , nor does he tempt anyone ;
59001014	but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed .
59001015	Then , after desire has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and sin , when it is full-grown , gives birth to death .
59001016	Don't be deceived , my dear brothers and sisters .
59001017	Every good and perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights , who does not change like shifting shadows .
59001018	He chose to give us birth through the word of truth , that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created .
59001019	My dear brothers and sisters , take note of this : Everyone should be quick to listen , slow to speak and slow to become angry ,
59001020	because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires .
59001021	Therefore , get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you , which can save you .
59001022	Do not merely listen to the word , and so deceive yourselves . Do what it says .
59001023	Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror
59001024	and , after looking at himself , goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like .
59001025	But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom , and continues in it — not forgetting what they have heard , but doing it — they will be blessed in what they do .
59001026	Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves , and their religion is worthless .
59001027	Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this : to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world .
59002001	My brothers and sisters , believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism .
59002002	Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes , and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in .
59002003	If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say , " Here's a good seat for you , " but say to the poor man , " You stand there " or " Sit on the floor by my feet , "
59002004	have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts ?
59002005	Listen , my dear brothers and sisters : Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him ?
59002006	But you have dishonored the poor . Is it not the rich who are exploiting you ? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court ?
59002007	Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong ?
59002008	If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture , " Love your neighbor as yourself , " you are doing right .
59002009	But if you show favoritism , you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers .
59002010	For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it .
59002011	For he who said , " You shall not commit adultery , " also said , " You shall not murder . " If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder , you have become a lawbreaker .
59002012	Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom ,
59002013	because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful . Mercy triumphs over judgment .
59002014	What good is it , my brothers and sisters , if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds ? Can such faith save them ?
59002015	Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food .
59002016	If one of you says to them , " Go in peace ; keep warm and well fed , " but does nothing about their physical needs , what good is it ?
59002017	In the same way , faith by itself , if it is not accompanied by action , is dead .
59002018	But someone will say , " You have faith ; I have deeds . " Show me your faith without deeds , and I will show you my faith by my deeds .
59002019	You believe that there is one God . Good ! Even the demons believe that — and shudder .
59002020	You foolish person , do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless ?
59002021	Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar ?
59002022	You see that his faith and his actions were working together , and his faith was made complete by what he did .
59002023	And the scripture was fulfilled that says , " Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness , " and he was called God's friend .
59002024	You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone .
59002025	In the same way , was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction ?
59002026	As the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without deeds is dead .
59003001	Not many of you should become teachers , my fellow believers , because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly .
59003002	We all stumble in many ways . Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect , able to keep their whole body in check .
59003003	When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us , we can turn the whole animal .
59003004	Or take ships as an example . Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds , they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go .
59003005	Likewise , the tongue is a small part of the body , but it makes great boasts . Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark .
59003006	The tongue also is a fire , a world of evil among the parts of the body . It corrupts the whole body , sets the whole course of one's life on fire , and is itself set on fire by hell .
59003007	All kinds of animals , birds , reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind ,
59003008	but no human being can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
59003009	With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father , and with it we curse human beings , who have been made in God's likeness .
59003010	Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing . My brothers and sisters , this should not be .
59003011	Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring ?
59003012	My brothers and sisters , can a fig tree bear olives , or a grapevine bear figs ? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water .
59003013	Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let them show it by their good life , by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom .
59003014	But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts , do not boast about it or deny the truth .
59003015	Such " wisdom " does not come down from heaven but is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
59003016	For where you have envy and selfish ambition , there you find disorder and every evil practice .
59003017	But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure ; then peace-loving , considerate , submissive , full of mercy and good fruit , impartial and sincere .
59003018	Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness .
59004001	What causes fights and quarrels among you ? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you ?
59004002	You desire but do not have , so you kill . You covet but you cannot get what you want , so you quarrel and fight . You do not have because you do not ask God .
59004003	When you ask , you do not receive , because you ask with wrong motives , that you may spend what you get on your pleasures .
59004004	You adulterous people , don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God ? Therefore , anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God .
59004005	Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us ?
59004006	But he gives us more grace . That is why Scripture says :
59004008	Come near to God and he will come near to you . Wash your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you double-minded .
59004009	Grieve , mourn and wail . Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom .
59004010	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up .
59004011	Brothers and sisters , do not slander one another . Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it . When you judge the law , you are not keeping it , but sitting in judgment on it .
59004012	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge , the one who is able to save and destroy . But you — who are you to judge your neighbor ?
59004013	Now listen , you who say , " Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city , spend a year there , carry on business and make money . "
59004014	Why , you do not even know what will happen tomorrow . What is your life ? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes .
59004015	Instead , you ought to say , " If it is the Lord's will , we will live and do this or that . "
59004016	As it is , you boast in your arrogant schemes . All such boasting is evil .
59004017	If anyone , then , knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it , it is sin for them .
59005001	Now listen , you rich people , weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you .
59005002	Your wealth has rotted , and moths have eaten your clothes .
59005003	Your gold and silver are corroded . Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire . You have hoarded wealth in the last days .
59005004	Look ! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you . The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty .
59005005	You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence . You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter .
59005006	You have condemned and murdered the innocent one , who was not opposing you .
59005007	Be patient , then , brothers and sisters , until the Lord's coming . See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop , patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains .
59005008	You too , be patient and stand firm , because the Lord's coming is near .
59005009	Don't grumble against one another , brothers and sisters , or you will be judged . The Judge is standing at the door !
59005010	Brothers and sisters , as an example of patience in the face of suffering , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
59005011	As you know , we count as blessed those who have persevered . You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about . The Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
59005012	Above all , my brothers and sisters , do not swear — not by heaven or by earth or by anything else . All you need to say is a simple " Yes " or " No . " Otherwise you will be condemned .
59005013	Is anyone among you in trouble ? Let them pray . Is anyone happy ? Let them sing songs of praise .
59005014	Is anyone among you sick ? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord .
59005015	And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well ; the Lord will raise them up . If they have sinned , they will be forgiven .
59005016	Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective .
59005017	Elijah was a human being , even as we are . He prayed earnestly that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years .
59005018	Again he prayed , and the heavens gave rain , and the earth produced its crops .
59005019	My brothers and sisters , if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back ,
59005020	remember this : Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins .
60001001	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , To God's elect , exiles scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia and Bithynia ,
60001002	who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through the sanctifying work of the Spirit , to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood : Grace and peace be yours in abundance .
60001003	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
60001004	and into an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade . This inheritance is kept in heaven for you ,
60001005	who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time .
60001006	In all this you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials .
60001007	These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith — of greater worth than gold , which perishes even though refined by fire — may result in praise , glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed .
60001008	Though you have not seen him , you love him ; and even though you do not see him now , you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy ,
60001009	for you are receiving the end result of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
60001010	Concerning this salvation , the prophets , who spoke of the grace that was to come to you , searched intently and with the greatest care ,
60001011	trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow .
60001012	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you , when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Even angels long to look into these things .
60001013	Therefore , with minds that are alert and fully sober , set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming .
60001014	As obedient children , do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance .
60001015	But just as he who called you is holy , so be holy in all you do ;
60001016	for it is written : " Be holy , because I am holy . "
60001017	Since you call on a Father who judges each person's work impartially , live out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear .
60001018	For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors ,
60001019	but with the precious blood of Christ , a lamb without blemish or defect .
60001020	He was chosen before the creation of the world , but was revealed in these last times for your sake .
60001021	Through him you believe in God , who raised him from the dead and glorified him , and so your faith and hope are in God .
60001022	Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for each other , love one another deeply , from the heart .
60001023	For you have been born again , not of perishable seed , but of imperishable , through the living and enduring word of God .
60001024	For , " All people are like grass , and all their glory is like the flowers of the field ; the grass withers and the flowers fall ,
60001025	but the word of the Lord endures forever . " And this is the word that was preached to you .
60002001	Therefore , rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit , hypocrisy , envy , and slander of every kind .
60002002	Like newborn babies , crave pure spiritual milk , so that by it you may grow up in your salvation ,
60002003	now that you have tasted that the Lord is good .
60002004	As you come to him , the living Stone — rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him —
60002005	you also , like living stones , are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood , offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
60002006	For in Scripture it says : " See , I lay a stone in Zion , a chosen and precious cornerstone , and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame . "
60002007	Now to you who believe , this stone is precious . But to those who do not believe , " The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone , "
60002008	and , " A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall . " They stumble because they disobey the message — which is also what they were destined for .
60002009	But you are a chosen people , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , God's special possession , that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light .
60002010	Once you were not a people , but now you are the people of God ; once you had not received mercy , but now you have received mercy .
60002011	Dear friends , I urge you , as foreigners and exiles , to abstain from sinful desires , which wage war against your soul .
60002012	Live such good lives among the pagans that , though they accuse you of doing wrong , they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us .
60002013	Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority : whether to the emperor , as the supreme authority ,
60002014	or to governors , who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right .
60002015	For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people .
60002016	Live as free people , but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil ; live as God's slaves .
60002017	Show proper respect to everyone , love the family of believers , fear God , honor the emperor .
60002018	Slaves , in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters , not only to those who are good and considerate , but also to those who are harsh .
60002019	For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God .
60002020	But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it ? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it , this is commendable before God .
60002021	To this you were called , because Christ suffered for you , leaving you an example , that you should follow in his steps .
60002022	" He committed no sin , and no deceit was found in his mouth . "
60002023	When they hurled their insults at him , he did not retaliate ; when he suffered , he made no threats . Instead , he entrusted himself to him who judges justly .
60002024	" He himself bore our sins " in his body on the cross , so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness ; " by his wounds you have been healed . "
60002025	For " you were like sheep going astray , " but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls .
60003001	Wives , in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that , if any of them do not believe the word , they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives ,
60003002	when they see the purity and reverence of your lives .
60003003	Your beauty should not come from outward adornment , such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes .
60003004	Rather , it should be that of your inner self , the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is of great worth in God's sight .
60003005	For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves . They submitted themselves to their own husbands ,
60003006	like Sarah , who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord . You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear .
60003007	Husbands , in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives , and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life , so that nothing will hinder your prayers .
60003008	Finally , all of you , be like-minded , be sympathetic , love one another , be compassionate and humble .
60003009	Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult . On the contrary , repay evil with blessing , because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing .
60003010	For , " Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech .
60003011	They must turn from evil and do good ; they must seek peace and pursue it .
60003012	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer , but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . "
60003013	Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good ?
60003014	But even if you should suffer for what is right , you are blessed . " Do not fear their threats ; do not be frightened . "
60003015	But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord . Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have . But do this with gentleness and respect ,
60003016	keeping a clear conscience , so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander .
60003017	For it is better , if it is God's will , to suffer for doing good than for doing evil .
60003018	For Christ also suffered once for sins , the righteous for the unrighteous , to bring you to God . He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit .
60003019	After being made alive , he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits —
60003020	to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built . In it only a few people , eight in all , were saved through water ,
60003021	and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also — not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God . It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,
60003022	who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand — with angels , authorities and powers in submission to him .
60004001	Therefore , since Christ suffered in his body , arm yourselves also with the same attitude , because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin .
60004002	As a result , they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires , but rather for the will of God .
60004003	For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do — living in debauchery , lust , drunkenness , orgies , carousing and detestable idolatry .
60004004	They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless , wild living , and they heap abuse on you .
60004005	But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
60004006	For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead , so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body , but live according to God in regard to the spirit .
60004007	The end of all things is near . Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray .
60004008	Above all , love each other deeply , because love covers over a multitude of sins .
60004009	Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling .
60004010	Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others , as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms .
60004011	If anyone speaks , they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God . If anyone serves , they should do so with the strength God provides , so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ . To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever . Amen .
60004012	Dear friends , do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you , as though something strange were happening to you .
60004013	But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ , so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed .
60004014	If you are insulted because of the name of Christ , you are blessed , for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you .
60004015	If you suffer , it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal , or even as a meddler .
60004016	However , if you suffer as a Christian , do not be ashamed , but praise God that you bear that name .
60004017	For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household ; and if it begins with us , what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God ?
60004018	And , " If it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what will become of the ungodly and the sinner ? "
60004019	So then , those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good .
60005001	To the elders among you , I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ's sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed :
60005002	Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care , watching over them — not because you must , but because you are willing , as God wants you to be ; not pursuing dishonest gain , but eager to serve ;
60005003	not lording it over those entrusted to you , but being examples to the flock .
60005004	And when the Chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away .
60005005	In the same way , you who are younger , submit yourselves to your elders . All of you , clothe yourselves with humility toward one another , because ,
60005006	Humble yourselves , therefore , under God's mighty hand , that he may lift you up in due time .
60005007	Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you .
60005008	Be alert and of sober mind . Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour .
60005009	Resist him , standing firm in the faith , because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings .
60005010	And the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory in Christ , after you have suffered a little while , will himself restore you and make you strong , firm and steadfast .
60005011	To him be the power for ever and ever . Amen .
60005012	With the help of Silas , whom I regard as a faithful brother , I have written to you briefly , encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God . Stand fast in it .
60005013	She who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , sends you her greetings , and so does my son Mark .
60005014	Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace to all of you who are in Christ .
61001001	Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours :
61001002	Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord .
61001003	His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness .
61001004	Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises , so that through them you may participate in the divine nature , having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires .
61001005	For this very reason , make every effort to add to your faith goodness ; and to goodness , knowledge ;
61001006	and to knowledge , self-control ; and to self-control , perseverance ; and to perseverance , godliness ;
61001007	and to godliness , mutual affection ; and to mutual affection , love .
61001008	For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure , they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
61001009	But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind , forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins .
61001010	Therefore , my brothers and sisters , make every effort to confirm your calling and election . For if you do these things , you will never stumble ,
61001011	and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
61001012	So I will always remind you of these things , even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have .
61001013	I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body ,
61001014	because I know that I will soon put it aside , as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me .
61001015	And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things .
61001016	For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power , but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
61001017	He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory , saying , " This is my Son , whom I love ; with him I am well pleased . "
61001018	We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain .
61001019	We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable , and you will do well to pay attention to it , as to a light shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts .
61001020	Above all , you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things .
61001021	For prophecy never had its origin in the human will , but prophets , though human , spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit .
61002001	But there were also false prophets among the people , just as there will be false teachers among you . They will secretly introduce destructive heresies , even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them — bringing swift destruction on themselves .
61002002	Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute .
61002003	In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories . Their condemnation has long been hanging over them , and their destruction has not been sleeping .
61002004	For if God did not spare angels when they sinned , but sent them to hell , putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment ;
61002005	if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people , but protected Noah , a preacher of righteousness , and seven others ;
61002006	if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes , and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly ;
61002007	and if he rescued Lot , a righteous man , who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless
61002008	( for that righteous man , living among them day after day , was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard ) —
61002009	if this is so , then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment .
61002010	This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority . Bold and arrogant , they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings ;
61002011	yet even angels , although they are stronger and more powerful , do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord .
61002012	But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand . They are like unreasoning animals , creatures of instinct , born only to be caught and destroyed , and like animals they too will perish .
61002013	They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done . Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight . They are blots and blemishes , reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you .
61002014	With eyes full of adultery , they never stop sinning ; they seduce the unstable ; they are experts in greed — an accursed brood !
61002015	They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Bezer , who loved the wages of wickedness .
61002016	But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey — an animal without speech — who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's madness .
61002017	These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm . Blackest darkness is reserved for them .
61002018	For they mouth empty , boastful words and , by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh , they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error .
61002019	They promise them freedom , while they themselves are slaves of depravity — for " people are slaves to whatever has mastered them . "
61002020	If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome , they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning .
61002021	It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them .
61002022	Of them the proverbs are true : " A dog returns to its vomit , " and , " A sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud . "
61003001	Dear friends , this is now my second letter to you . I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking .
61003002	I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles .
61003003	Above all , you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come , scoffing and following their own evil desires .
61003004	They will say , " Where is this ' coming ' he promised ? Ever since our ancestors died , everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation . "
61003005	But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water .
61003006	By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed .
61003007	By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire , being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly .
61003008	But do not forget this one thing , dear friends : With the Lord a day is like a thousand years , and a thousand years are like a day .
61003009	The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise , as some understand slowness . Instead he is patient with you , not wanting anyone to perish , but everyone to come to repentance .
61003010	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a roar ; the elements will be destroyed by fire , and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare .
61003011	Since everything will be destroyed in this way , what kind of people ought you to be ? You ought to live holy and godly lives
61003012	as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming . That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire , and the elements will melt in the heat .
61003013	But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth , where righteousness dwells .
61003014	So then , dear friends , since you are looking forward to this , make every effort to be found spotless , blameless and at peace with him .
61003015	Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation , just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him .
61003016	He writes the same way in all his letters , speaking in them of these matters . His letters contain some things that are hard to understand , which ignorant and unstable people distort , as they do the other Scriptures , to their own destruction .
61003017	Therefore , dear friends , since you have been forewarned , be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position .
61003018	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and forever ! Amen .
62001001	That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked at and our hands have touched — this we proclaim concerning the Word of life .
62001002	The life appeared ; we have seen it and testify to it , and we proclaim to you the eternal life , which was with the Father and has appeared to us .
62001003	We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard , so that you also may have fellowship with us . And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
62001004	We write this to make our joy complete .
62001005	This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you : God is light ; in him there is no darkness at all .
62001006	If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness , we lie and do not live out the truth .
62001007	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus , his Son , purifies us from all sin .
62001008	If we claim to be without sin , we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us .
62001009	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness .
62001010	If we claim we have not sinned , we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us .
62002001	My dear children , I write this to you so that you will not sin . But if anybody does sin , we have an advocate with the Father — Jesus Christ , the Righteous One .
62002002	He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins , and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world .
62002003	We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands .
62002004	Whoever says , " I know him , " but does not do what he commands is a liar , and the truth is not in that person .
62002005	But if anyone obeys his word , love for God is truly made complete in them . This is how we know we are in him :
62002006	Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did .
62002007	Dear friends , I am not writing you a new command but an old one , which you have had since the beginning . This old command is the message you have heard .
62002008	Yet I am writing you a new command ; its truth is seen in him and in you , because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining .
62002009	Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness .
62002010	Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light , and there is nothing in them to make them stumble .
62002011	But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness . They do not know where they are going , because the darkness has blinded them .
62002012	I am writing to you , dear children ,
62002014	I write to you , dear children ,
62002015	Do not love the world or anything in the world . If anyone loves the world , love for the Father is not in them .
62002016	For everything in the world — the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life — comes not from the Father but from the world .
62002017	The world and its desires pass away , but whoever does the will of God lives forever .
62002018	Dear children , this is the last hour ; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming , even now many antichrists have come . This is how we know it is the last hour .
62002019	They went out from us , but they did not really belong to us . For if they had belonged to us , they would have remained with us ; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us .
62002020	But you have an anointing from the Holy One , and all of you know the truth .
62002021	I do not write to you because you do not know the truth , but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth .
62002022	Who is the liar ? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ . Such a person is the antichrist — denying the Father and the Son .
62002023	No one who denies the Son has the Father ; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also .
62002024	As for you , see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you . If it does , you also will remain in the Son and in the Father .
62002025	And this is what he promised us — eternal life .
62002026	I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray .
62002027	As for you , the anointing you received from him remains in you , and you do not need anyone to teach you . But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real , not counterfeit — just as it has taught you , remain in him .
62002028	And now , dear children , continue in him , so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming .
62002029	If you know that he is righteous , you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him .
62003001	See what great love the Father has lavished on us , that we should be called children of God ! And that is what we are ! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him .
62003002	Dear friends , now we are children of God , and what we will be has not yet been made known . But we know that when Christ appears , we shall be like him , for we shall see him as he is .
62003003	All who have this hope in him purify themselves , just as he is pure .
62003004	Everyone who sins breaks the law ; in fact , sin is lawlessness .
62003005	But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins . And in him is no sin .
62003006	No one who lives in him keeps on sinning . No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him .
62003007	Dear children , do not let anyone lead you astray . The one who does what is right is righteous , just as he is righteous .
62003008	The one who does what is sinful is of the devil , because the devil has been sinning from the beginning . The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work .
62003009	No one who is born of God will continue to sin , because God's seed remains in them ; they cannot go on sinning , because they have been born of God .
62003010	This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are : Anyone who does not do what is right is not God's child , nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister .
62003011	For this is the message you heard from the beginning : We should love one another .
62003012	Do not be like Cain , who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he murder him ? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous .
62003013	Do not be surprised , my brothers and sisters , if the world hates you .
62003014	We know that we have passed from death to life , because we love each other . Anyone who does not love remains in death .
62003015	Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him .
62003016	This is how we know what love is : Jesus Christ laid down his life for us . And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters .
62003017	If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them , how can the love of God be that person ?
62003018	Dear children , let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth .
62003019	This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence :
62003020	If our hearts condemn us , we know that God is greater than our hearts , and he knows everything .
62003021	Dear friends , if our hearts do not condemn us , we have confidence before God
62003022	and receive from him anything we ask , because we keep his commands and do what pleases him .
62003023	And this is his command : to believe in the name of his Son , Jesus Christ , and to love one another as he commanded us .
62003024	The one who keeps God's commands lives in him , and he in them . And this is how we know that he lives in us : We know it by the Spirit he gave us .
62004001	Dear friends , do not believe every spirit , but test the spirits to see whether they are from God , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
62004002	This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God : Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God ,
62004003	but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God . This is the spirit of the antichrist , which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world .
62004004	You , dear children , are from God and have overcome them , because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world .
62004005	They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world , and the world listens to them .
62004006	We are from God , and whoever knows God listens to us ; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us . This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood .
62004007	Dear friends , let us love one another , for love comes from God . Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God .
62004008	Whoever does not love does not know God , because God is love .
62004009	This is how God showed his love among us : He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
62004010	This is love : not that we loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins .
62004011	Dear friends , since God so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
62004012	No one has ever seen God ; but if we love one another , God lives in us and his love is made complete in us .
62004013	This is how we know that we live in him and he in us : He has given us of his Spirit .
62004014	And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world .
62004015	If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God , God lives in them and they in God .
62004016	And so we know and rely on the love God has for us . God is love . Whoever lives in love lives in God , and God in them .
62004017	This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment : In this world we are like Jesus .
62004018	There is no fear in love . But perfect love drives out fear , because fear has to do with punishment . The one who fears is not made perfect in love .
62004019	We love because he first loved us .
62004020	Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar . For whoever does not love their brother and sister , whom they have seen , cannot love God , whom they have not seen .
62004021	And he has given us this command : Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister .
62005001	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God , and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well .
62005002	This is how we know that we love the children of God : by loving God and carrying out his commands .
62005003	In fact , this is love for God : to keep his commands . And his commands are not burdensome ,
62005004	for everyone born of God overcomes the world . This is the victory that has overcome the world , even our faith .
62005005	Who is it that overcomes the world ? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God .
62005006	This is the one who came by water and blood — Jesus Christ . He did not come by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit who testifies , because the Spirit is the truth .
62005007	For there are three that testify :
62005008	the Spirit , the water and the blood ; and the three are in agreement .
62005009	We accept human testimony , but God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God , which he has given about his Son .
62005010	Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony . Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar , because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son .
62005011	And this is the testimony : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
62005012	Whoever has the Son has life ; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life .
62005013	I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life .
62005014	This is the confidence we have in approaching God : that if we ask anything according to his will , he hears us .
62005015	And if we know that he hears us — whatever we ask — we know that we have what we asked of him .
62005016	If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death , you should pray and God will give them life . I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death . There is a sin that leads to death . I am not saying that you should pray about that .
62005017	All wrongdoing is sin , and there is sin that does not lead to death .
62005018	We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin ; the One who was born of God keeps them safe , and the evil one cannot harm them .
62005019	We know that we are children of God , and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one .
62005020	We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding , so that we may know him who is true . And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ . He is the true God and eternal life .
62005021	Dear children , keep yourselves from idols .
63001001	The elder , To the lady chosen by God and to her children , whom I love in the truth — and not I only , but also all who know the truth —
63001002	because of the truth , which lives in us and will be with us forever :
63001003	Grace , mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ , the Father's Son , will be with us in truth and love .
63001004	It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth , just as the Father commanded us .
63001005	And now , dear lady , I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning . I ask that we love one another .
63001006	And this is love : that we walk in obedience to his commands . As you have heard from the beginning , his command is that you walk in love .
63001007	I say this because many deceivers , who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh , have gone out into the world . Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist .
63001008	Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for , but that you may be rewarded fully .
63001009	Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God ; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son .
63001010	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching , do not take them into your house or welcome them .
63001011	Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work .
63001012	I have much to write to you , but I do not want to use paper and ink . Instead , I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face , so that our joy may be complete .
63001013	The children of your sister , who is chosen by God , send their greetings .
64001001	The elder , To my dear friend Gaius , whom I love in the truth .
64001002	Dear friend , I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you , even as your soul is getting along well .
64001003	It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth , telling how you continue to walk in it .
64001004	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth .
64001005	Dear friend , you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters , even though they are strangers to you .
64001006	They have told the church about your love . Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God .
64001007	It was for the sake of the Name that they went out , receiving no help from the pagans .
64001008	We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth .
64001009	I wrote to the church , but Diotrephes , who loves to be first , will not welcome us .
64001010	So when I come , I will call attention to what he is doing , spreading malicious nonsense about us . Not satisfied with that , he even refuses to welcome other believers . He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church .
64001011	Dear friend , do not imitate what is evil but what is good . Anyone who does what is good is from God . Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God .
64001012	Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone — and even by the truth itself . We also speak well of him , and you know that our testimony is true .
64001013	I have much to write you , but I do not want to do so with pen and ink .
64001014	I hope to see you soon , and we will talk face to face . Peace to you . The friends here send their greetings . Greet the friends there by name .
64001015	
65001001	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James , To those who have been called , who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ :
65001002	Mercy , peace and love be yours in abundance .
65001003	Dear friends , although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share , I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people .
65001004	For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you . They are ungodly people , who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord .
65001005	Though you already know all this , I want to remind you that the Lord at one time delivered his people out of Egypt , but later destroyed those who did not believe .
65001006	And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling — these he has kept in darkness , bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day .
65001007	In a similar way , Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion . They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire .
65001008	In the very same way , on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies , reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings .
65001009	But even the archangel Michael , when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses , did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said , " The Lord rebuke you ! "
65001010	Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand , and the very things they do understand by instinct — as irrational animals do — will destroy them .
65001011	Woe to them ! They have taken the way of Cain ; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error ; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion .
65001012	These people are blemishes at your love feasts , eating with you without the slightest qualm — shepherds who feed only themselves . They are clouds without rain , blown along by the wind ; autumn trees , without fruit and uprooted — twice dead .
65001013	They are wild waves of the sea , foaming up their shame ; wandering stars , for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever .
65001014	Enoch , the seventh from Adam , prophesied about them : " See , the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones
65001015	to judge everyone , and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness , and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him . "
65001016	These people are grumblers and faultfinders ; they follow their own evil desires ; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage .
65001017	But , dear friends , remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold .
65001018	They said to you , " In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires . "
65001019	These are the people who divide you , who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit .
65001020	But you , dear friends , by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit ,
65001021	keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life .
65001022	Be merciful to those who doubt ;
65001023	save others by snatching them from the fire ; to others show mercy , mixed with fear — hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh .
65001024	To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy —
65001025	to the only God our Savior be glory , majesty , power and authority , through Jesus Christ our Lord , before all ages , now and forevermore ! Amen .
66001001	The revelation from Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place . He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John ,
66001002	who testifies to everything he saw — that is , the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ .
66001003	Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy , and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it , because the time is near .
66001004	John , To the seven churches in the province of Asia : Grace and peace to you from him who is , and who was , and who is to come , and from the seven spirits before his throne ,
66001005	and from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , the firstborn from the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood ,
66001006	and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father — to him be glory and power for ever and ever ! Amen .
66001007	" Look , he is coming with the clouds , "
66001008	" I am the Alpha and the Omega , " says the Lord God , " who is , and who was , and who is to come , the Almighty . "
66001009	I , John , your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus , was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus .
66001010	On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit , and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet ,
66001011	which said : " Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia and Laodicea . "
66001012	I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me . And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands ,
66001013	and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man , dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest .
66001014	The hair on his head was white like wool , as white as snow , and his eyes were like blazing fire .
66001015	His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace , and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters .
66001016	In his right hand he held seven stars , and coming out of his mouth was a sharp , double-edged sword . His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance .
66001017	When I saw him , I fell at his feet as though dead . Then he placed his right hand on me and said : " Do not be afraid . I am the First and the Last .
66001018	I am the Living One ; I was dead , and now look , I am alive for ever and ever ! And I hold the keys of death and Hades .
66001019	" Write , therefore , what you have seen , what is now and what will take place later .
66001020	The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this : The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches , and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .
66002001	" To the angel of the church in Ephesus write : These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands .
66002002	I know your deeds , your hard work and your perseverance . I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people , that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not , and have found them false .
66002003	You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name , and have not grown weary .
66002004	Yet I hold this against you : You have forsaken the love you had at first .
66002005	Consider how far you have fallen ! Repent and do the things you did at first . If you do not repent , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place .
66002006	But you have this in your favor : You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
66002007	Whoever has ears , let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To the one who is victorious , I will give the right to eat from the tree of life , which is in the paradise of God .
66002008	" To the angel of the church in Smyrna write : These are the words of him who is the First and the Last , who died and came to life again .
66002009	I know your afflictions and your poverty — yet you are rich ! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
66002010	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer . I tell you , the devil will put some of you in prison to test you , and you will suffer persecution for ten days . Be faithful , even to the point of death , and I will give you life as your victor's crown .
66002011	Whoever has ears , let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches . The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death .
66002012	" To the angel of the church in Pergamum write : These are the words of him who has the sharp , double-edged sword .
66002013	I know where you live — where Satan has his throne . Yet you remain true to my name . You did not renounce your faith in me , not even in the days of Antipas , my faithful witness , who was put to death in your city — where Satan lives .
66002014	Nevertheless , I have a few things against you : There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality .
66002015	Likewise , you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
66002016	Repent therefore ! Otherwise , I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
66002017	Whoever has ears , let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches . To the one who is victorious , I will give some of the hidden manna . I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it , known only to the one who receives it .
66002018	" To the angel of the church in Thyatira write : These are the words of the Son of God , whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze .
66002019	I know your deeds , your love and faith , your service and perseverance , and that you are now doing more than you did at first .
66002020	Nevertheless , I have this against you : You tolerate that woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophet . By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols .
66002021	I have given her time to repent of her immorality , but she is unwilling .
66002022	So I will cast her on a bed of suffering , and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely , unless they repent of her ways .
66002023	I will strike her children dead . Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds , and I will repay each of you according to your deeds .
66002024	Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira , to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets , ' I will not impose any other burden on you ,
66002025	except to hold on to what you have until I come . '
66002026	To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end , I will give authority over the nations —
66002027	that one ' will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery ' — just as I have received authority from my Father .
66002028	I will also give that one the morning star .
66002029	Whoever has ears , let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003001	" To the angel of the church in Sardis write : These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars . I know your deeds ; you have a reputation of being alive , but you are dead .
66003002	Wake up ! Strengthen what remains and is about to die , for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God .
66003003	Remember , therefore , what you have received and heard ; hold it fast , and repent . But if you do not wake up , I will come like a thief , and you will not know at what time I will come to you .
66003004	Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes . They will walk with me , dressed in white , for they are worthy .
66003005	The one who is victorious will , like them , be dressed in white . I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life , but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels .
66003006	Whoever has ears , let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003007	" To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write : These are the words of him who is holy and true , who holds the key of David . What he opens no one can shut , and what he shuts no one can open .
66003008	I know your deeds . See , I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut . I know that you have little strength , yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name .
66003009	I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan , who claim to be Jews though they are not , but are liars — I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you .
66003010	Since you have kept my command to endure patiently , I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth .
66003011	I am coming soon . Hold on to what you have , so that no one will take your crown .
66003012	The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God . Never again will they leave it . I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , which is coming down out of heaven from my God ; and I will also write on them my new name .
66003013	Whoever has ears , let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches .
66003014	" To the angel of the church in Laodicea write : These are the words of the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the ruler of God's creation .
66003015	I know your deeds , that you are neither cold nor hot . I wish you were either one or the other !
66003016	So , because you are lukewarm — neither hot nor cold — I am about to spit you out of my mouth .
66003017	You say , ' I am rich ; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing . ' But you do not realize that you are wretched , pitiful , poor , blind and naked .
66003018	I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire , so you can become rich ; and white clothes to wear , so you can cover your shameful nakedness ; and salve to put on your eyes , so you can see .
66003019	Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline . So be earnest and repent .
66003020	Here I am ! I stand at the door and knock . If anyone hears my voice and opens the door , I will come in and eat with that person , and they with me .
66003021	To the one who is victorious , I will give the right to sit with me on my throne , just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne .
66003022	Whoever has ears , let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches . "
66004001	After this I looked , and there before me was a door standing open in heaven . And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said , " Come up here , and I will show you what must take place after this . "
66004002	At once I was in the Spirit , and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it .
66004003	And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby . A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne .
66004004	Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones , and seated on them were twenty-four elders . They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads .
66004005	From the throne came flashes of lightning , rumblings and peals of thunder . In front of the throne , seven lamps were blazing . These are the seven spirits of God .
66004006	Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass , clear as crystal . In the center , around the throne , were four living creatures , and they were covered with eyes , in front and in back .
66004007	The first living creature was like a lion , the second was like an ox , the third had a face like a man , the fourth was like a flying eagle .
66004008	Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around , even under its wings . Day and night they never stop saying : " ' Holy , holy , holyis the Lord God Almighty , ' who was , and is , and is to come . "
66004009	Whenever the living creatures give glory , honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever ,
66004010	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever . They lay their crowns before the throne and say :
66004011	" You are worthy , our Lord and God ,
66005001	Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals .
66005002	And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice , " Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? "
66005003	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it .
66005004	I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
66005005	Then one of the elders said to me , " Do not weep ! See , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has triumphed . He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals . "
66005006	Then I saw a Lamb , looking as if it had been slain , standing at the center of the throne , encircled by the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth .
66005007	He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne .
66005008	And when he had taken it , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb . Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of God's people .
66005009	And they sang a new song , saying :
66005011	Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels , numbering thousands upon thousands , and ten thousand times ten thousand . They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders .
66005012	In a loud voice they were saying :
66005014	The four living creatures said , " Amen , " and the elders fell down and worshiped .
66006001	I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals . Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder , " Come ! "
66006002	I looked , and there before me was a white horse ! Its rider held a bow , and he was given a crown , and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest .
66006003	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , " Come ! "
66006004	Then another horse came out , a fiery red one . Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other . To him was given a large sword .
66006005	When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , " Come ! " I looked , and there before me was a black horse ! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand .
66006006	Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures , saying , " Two pounds of wheat for a day's wages , and six pounds of barley for a day's wages , and do not damage the oil and the wine ! "
66006007	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , " Come ! "
66006008	I looked , and there before me was a pale horse ! Its rider was named Death , and Hades was following close behind him . They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword , famine and plague , and by the wild beasts of the earth .
66006009	When he opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained .
66006010	They called out in a loud voice , " How long , Sovereign Lord , holy and true , until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood ? "
66006011	Then each of them was given a white robe , and they were told to wait a little longer , until the full number of their fellow servants , their brothers and sisters , were killed just as they had been .
66006012	I watched as he opened the sixth seal . There was a great earthquake . The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair , the whole moon turned blood red ,
66006013	and the stars in the sky fell to earth , as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind .
66006014	The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was removed from its place .
66006015	Then the kings of the earth , the princes , the generals , the rich , the mighty , and everyone else , both slave and free , hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
66006016	They called to the mountains and the rocks , " Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb !
66006017	For the great day of their wrath has come , and who can withstand it ? "
66007001	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree .
66007002	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east , having the seal of the living God . He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea :
66007003	" Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God . "
66007004	Then I heard the number of those who were sealed : 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel .
66007005	From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed , from the tribe of Reuben 12,000 , from the tribe of Gad 12,000 ,
66007006	from the tribe of Asher 12,000 , from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000 , from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000 ,
66007007	from the tribe of Simeon 12,000 , from the tribe of Levi 12,000 , from the tribe of Issachar 12,000 ,
66007008	from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000 , from the tribe of Joseph 12,000 , from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000 .
66007009	After this I looked , and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count , from every nation , tribe , people and language , standing before the throne and before the Lamb . They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands .
66007010	And they cried out in a loud voice :
66007012	saying :
66007014	I answered , " Sir , you know . " And he said , " These are they who have come out of the great tribulation ; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
66007015	Therefore ,
66007017	For the Lamb at the center of the throne
66008001	When he opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven for about half an hour .
66008002	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and seven trumpets were given to them .
66008003	Another angel , who had a golden censer , came and stood at the altar . He was given much incense to offer , with the prayers of all God's people , on the golden altar in front of the throne .
66008004	The smoke of the incense , together with the prayers of God's people , went up before God from the angel's hand .
66008005	Then the angel took the censer , filled it with fire from the altar , and hurled it on the earth ; and there came peals of thunder , rumblings , flashes of lightning and an earthquake .
66008006	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them .
66008007	The first angel sounded his trumpet , and there came hail and fire mixed with blood , and it was hurled down on the earth . A third of the earth was burned up , a third of the trees were burned up , and all the green grass was burned up .
66008008	The second angel sounded his trumpet , and something like a huge mountain , all ablaze , was thrown into the sea . A third of the sea turned into blood ,
66008009	a third of the living creatures in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
66008010	The third angel sounded his trumpet , and a great star , blazing like a torch , fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water —
66008011	the name of the star is Wormwood . A third of the waters turned bitter , and many people died from the waters that had become bitter .
66008012	The fourth angel sounded his trumpet , and a third of the sun was struck , a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that a third of them turned dark . A third of the day was without light , and also a third of the night .
66008013	As I watched , I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice : " Woe ! Woe ! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth , because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels ! "
66009001	The fifth angel sounded his trumpet , and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth . The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss .
66009002	When he opened the Abyss , smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace . The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss .
66009003	And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth .
66009004	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree , but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
66009005	They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months . And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes .
66009006	During those days people will seek death but will not find it ; they will long to die , but death will elude them .
66009007	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle . On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold , and their faces resembled human faces .
66009008	Their hair was like women's hair , and their teeth were like lions' teeth .
66009009	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle .
66009010	They had tails with stingers , like scorpions , and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months .
66009011	They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss , whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon ( that is , Destroyer ) .
66009012	The first woe is past ; two other woes are yet to come .
66009013	The sixth angel sounded his trumpet , and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God .
66009014	It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , " Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates . "
66009015	And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind .
66009016	The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand . I heard their number .
66009017	The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this : Their breastplates were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow as sulfur . The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions , and out of their mouths came fire , smoke and sulfur .
66009018	A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire , smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths .
66009019	The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails ; for their tails were like snakes , having heads with which they inflict injury .
66009020	The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands ; they did not stop worshiping demons , and idols of gold , silver , bronze , stone and wood — idols that cannot see or hear or walk .
66009021	Nor did they repent of their murders , their magic arts , their sexual immorality or their thefts .
66010001	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven . He was robed in a cloud , with a rainbow above his head ; his face was like the sun , and his legs were like fiery pillars .
66010002	He was holding a little scroll , which lay open in his hand . He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
66010003	and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion . When he shouted , the voices of the seven thunders spoke .
66010004	And when the seven thunders spoke , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from heaven say , " Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down . "
66010005	Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .
66010006	And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever , who created the heavens and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it , and said , " There will be no more delay !
66010007	But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet , the mystery of God will be accomplished , just as he announced to his servants the prophets . "
66010008	Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more : " Go , take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . "
66010009	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll . He said to me , " Take it and eat it . It will turn your stomach sour , but ' in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey . ' "
66010010	I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it . It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth , but when I had eaten it , my stomach turned sour .
66010011	Then I was told , " You must prophesy again about many peoples , nations , languages and kings . "
66011001	I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told , " Go and measure the temple of God and the altar , with its worshipers .
66011002	But exclude the outer court ; do not measure it , because it has been given to the Gentiles . They will trample on the holy city for 42 months .
66011003	And I will appoint my two witnesses , and they will prophesy for 1,260 days , clothed in sackcloth . "
66011004	They are " the two olive trees " and the two lampstands , and " they stand before the Lord of the earth . "
66011005	If anyone tries to harm them , fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies . This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die .
66011006	They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying ; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want .
66011007	Now when they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them , and overpower and kill them .
66011008	Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city — which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt — where also their Lord was crucified .
66011009	For three and a half days some from every people , tribe , language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial .
66011010	The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts , because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth .
66011011	But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them , and they stood on their feet , and terror struck those who saw them .
66011012	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them , " Come up here . " And they went up to heaven in a cloud , while their enemies looked on .
66011013	At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed . Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
66011014	The second woe has passed ; the third woe is coming soon .
66011015	The seventh angel sounded his trumpet , and there were loud voices in heaven , which said :
66011017	saying :
66011019	Then God's temple in heaven was opened , and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant . And there came flashes of lightning , rumblings , peals of thunder , an earthquake and a severe hailstorm .
66012001	A great sign appeared in heaven : a woman clothed with the sun , with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head .
66012002	She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth .
66012003	Then another sign appeared in heaven : an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads .
66012004	Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth . The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth , so that it might devour her child the moment he was born .
66012005	She gave birth to a son , a male child , who " will rule all the nations with an iron scepter . " And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne .
66012006	The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God , where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days .
66012007	Then war broke out in heaven . Michael and his angels fought against the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought back .
66012008	But he was not strong enough , and they lost their place in heaven .
66012009	The great dragon was hurled down — that ancient serpent called the devil , or Satan , who leads the whole world astray . He was hurled to the earth , and his angels with him .
66012010	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say :
66012011	They triumphed over him
66012012	Therefore rejoice , you heavens
66012013	When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth , he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child .
66012014	The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle , so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness , where she would be taken care of for a time , times and half a time , out of the serpent's reach .
66012015	Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river , to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent .
66012016	But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth .
66012017	Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring — those who keep God's commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus .
66013001	The dragon stood on the shore of the sea . And I saw a beast coming out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads , with ten crowns on its horns , and on each head a blasphemous name .
66013002	The beast I saw resembled a leopard , but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion . The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority .
66013003	One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound , but the fatal wound had been healed . The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast .
66013004	People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast , and they also worshiped the beast and asked , " Who is like the beast ? Who can wage war against it ? "
66013005	The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months .
66013006	It opened its mouth to blaspheme God , and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven .
66013007	It was given power to wage war against God's holy people and to conquer them . And it was given authority over every tribe , people , language and nation .
66013008	All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast — all whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life , the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world .
66013009	Whoever has ears , let them hear .
66013010	" If anyone is to go into captivity ,
66013011	Then I saw a second beast , coming out of the earth . It had two horns like a lamb , but it spoke like a dragon .
66013012	It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf , and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast , whose fatal wound had been healed .
66013013	And it performed great signs , even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people .
66013014	Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast , it deceived the inhabitants of the earth . It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived .
66013015	The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast , so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed .
66013016	It also forced all people , great and small , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads ,
66013017	so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of its name .
66013018	This calls for wisdom . Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man . That number is 666 .
66014001	Then I looked , and there before me was the Lamb , standing on Mount Zion , and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads .
66014002	And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder . The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps .
66014003	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth .
66014004	These are those who did not defile themselves with women , for they remained virgins . They follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb .
66014005	No lie was found in their mouths ; they are blameless .
66014006	Then I saw another angel flying in midair , and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth — to every nation , tribe , language and people .
66014007	He said in a loud voice , " Fear God and give him glory , because the hour of his judgment has come . Worship him who made the heavens , the earth , the sea and the springs of water . "
66014008	A second angel followed and said , " ' Fallen ! Fallen is Babylon the Great , ' which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries . "
66014009	A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice : " If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand ,
66014010	they , too , will drink the wine of God's fury , which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath . They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb .
66014011	And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever . There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image , or for anyone who receives the mark of its name . "
66014012	This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus .
66014013	Then I heard a voice from heaven say , " Write this : Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on . " " Yes , " says the Spirit , " they will rest from their labor , for their deeds will follow them . "
66014014	I looked , and there before me was a white cloud , and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand .
66014015	Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud , " Take your sickle and reap , because the time to reap has come , for the harvest of the earth is ripe . "
66014016	So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
66014017	Another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he too had a sharp sickle .
66014018	Still another angel , who had charge of the fire , came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle , " Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine , because its grapes are ripe . "
66014019	The angel swung his sickle on the earth , gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath .
66014020	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city , and blood flowed out of the press , rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia .
66015001	I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign : seven angels with the seven last plagues — last , because with them God's wrath is completed .
66015002	And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and , standing beside the sea , those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name . They held harps given them by God
66015003	and sang the song of God's servant Moses and of the Lamb :
66015005	After this I looked , and I saw in heaven the temple — that is , the tabernacle of the covenant law — and it was opened .
66015006	Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues . They were dressed in clean , shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests .
66015007	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God , who lives for ever and ever .
66015008	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power , and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed .
66016001	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels , " Go , pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth . "
66016002	The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land , and ugly , festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image .
66016003	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea , and it turned into blood like that of a dead person , and every living thing in the sea died .
66016004	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water , and they became blood .
66016005	Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say :
66016007	And I heard the altar respond :
66016008	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire .
66016009	They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God , who had control over these plagues , but they refused to repent and glorify him .
66016010	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and its kingdom was plunged into darkness . People gnawed their tongues in agony
66016011	and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores , but they refused to repent of what they had done .
66016012	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates , and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East .
66016013	Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs ; they came out of the mouth of the dragon , out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
66016014	They are demonic spirits that perform signs , and they go out to the kings of the whole world , to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty .
66016015	" Look , I come like a thief ! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed , so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed . "
66016016	Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon .
66016017	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air , and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne , saying , " It is done ! "
66016018	Then there came flashes of lightning , rumblings , peals of thunder and a severe earthquake . No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth , so tremendous was the quake .
66016019	The great city split into three parts , and the cities of the nations collapsed . God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath .
66016020	Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found .
66016021	From the sky huge hailstones , each weighing about a hundred pounds , fell on people . And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail , because the plague was so terrible .
66017001	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me , " Come , I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute , who sits by many waters .
66017002	With her the kings of the earth committed adultery , and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries . "
66017003	Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness . There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns .
66017004	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet , and was glittering with gold , precious stones and pearls . She held a golden cup in her hand , filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries .
66017005	The name written on her forehead was a mystery : babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth .
66017006	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God's holy people , the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus . When I saw her , I was greatly astonished .
66017007	Then the angel said to me : " Why are you astonished ? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides , which has the seven heads and ten horns .
66017008	The beast , which you saw , once was , now is not , and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction . The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast , because it once was , now is not , and yet will come .
66017009	" This calls for a mind with wisdom . The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits .
66017010	They are also seven kings . Five have fallen , one is , the other has not yet come ; but when he does come , he must remain for only a little while .
66017011	The beast who once was , and now is not , is an eighth king . He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction .
66017012	" The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom , but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast .
66017013	They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast .
66017014	They will wage war against the Lamb , but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings — and with him will be his called , chosen and faithful followers . "
66017015	Then the angel said to me , " The waters you saw , where the prostitute sits , are peoples , multitudes , nations and languages .
66017016	The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute . They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked ; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire .
66017017	For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority , until God's words are fulfilled .
66017018	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth . "
66018001	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven . He had great authority , and the earth was illuminated by his splendor .
66018002	With a mighty voice he shouted :
66018004	Then I heard another voice from heaven say :
66018006	Give back to her as she has given ;
66018007	Give her as much torment and grief
66018008	Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her :
66018009	" When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning , they will weep and mourn over her .
66018010	Terrified at her torment , they will stand far off and cry :
66018012	cargoes of gold , silver , precious stones and pearls ; fine linen , purple , silk and scarlet cloth ; every sort of citron wood , and articles of every kind made of ivory , costly wood , bronze , iron and marble ;
66018013	cargoes of cinnamon and spice , of incense , myrrh and frankincense , of wine and olive oil , of fine flour and wheat ; cattle and sheep ; horses and carriages ; and human beings sold as slaves .
66018014	" They will say , ' The fruit you longed for is gone from you . All your luxury and splendor have vanished , never to be recovered . '
66018015	The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off , terrified at her torment . They will weep and mourn
66018016	and cry out :
66018018	When they see the smoke of her burning , they will exclaim , ' Was there ever a city like this great city ? '
66018019	They will throw dust on their heads , and with weeping and mourning cry out :
66018021	Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea , and said :
66018023	The light of a lamp
66018024	In her was found the blood of prophets and of God's holy people ,
66019001	After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting :
66019003	And again they shouted :
66019004	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God , who was seated on the throne . And they cried :
66019005	Then a voice came from the throne , saying :
66019006	Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude , like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder , shouting :
66019007	Let us rejoice and be glad
66019008	Fine linen , bright and clean ,
66019009	Then the angel said to me , " Write this : Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb ! " And he added , " These are the true words of God . "
66019010	At this I fell at his feet to worship him . But he said to me , " Don't do that ! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus . Worship God ! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus . "
66019011	I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse , whose rider is called Faithful and True . With justice he judges and wages war .
66019012	His eyes are like blazing fire , and on his head are many crowns . He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself .
66019013	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and his name is the Word of God .
66019014	The armies of heaven were following him , riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen , white and clean .
66019015	Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations . " He will rule them with an iron scepter . " He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty .
66019016	On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written : king of kings and lord of lords .
66019017	And I saw an angel standing in the sun , who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair , " Come , gather together for the great supper of God ,
66019018	so that you may eat the flesh of kings , generals , and the mighty , of horses and their riders , and the flesh of all people , free and slave , great and small . "
66019019	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army .
66019020	But the beast was captured , and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf . With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image . The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur .
66019021	The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh .
66020001	And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven , having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain .
66020002	He seized the dragon , that ancient serpent , who is the devil , or Satan , and bound him for a thousand years .
66020003	He threw him into the Abyss , and locked and sealed it over him , to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended . After that , he must be set free for a short time .
66020004	I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God . They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands . They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years .
66020005	( The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended . ) This is the first resurrection .
66020006	Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection . The second death has no power over them , but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years .
66020007	When the thousand years are over , Satan will be released from his prison
66020008	and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth — Gog and Magog — and to gather them for battle . In number they are like the sand on the seashore .
66020009	They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people , the city he loves . But fire came down from heaven and devoured them .
66020010	And the devil , who deceived them , was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown . They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
66020011	Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it . The earth and the heavens fled from his presence , and there was no place for them .
66020012	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne , and books were opened . Another book was opened , which is the book of life . The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books .
66020013	The sea gave up the dead that were in it , and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them , and each person was judged according to what they had done .
66020014	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . The lake of fire is the second death .
66020015	Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire .
66021001	Then I saw " a new heaven and a new earth , " for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away , and there was no longer any sea .
66021002	I saw the Holy City , the new Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God , prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband .
66021003	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying , " Look ! God's dwelling place is now among the people , and he will dwell with them . They will be his people , and God himself will be with them and be their God .
66021004	' He will wipe every tear from their eyes . There will be no more death ' or mourning or crying or pain , for the old order of things has passed away . "
66021005	He who was seated on the throne said , " I am making everything new ! " Then he said , " Write this down , for these words are trustworthy and true . "
66021006	He said to me : " It is done . I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life .
66021007	Those who are victorious will inherit all this , and I will be their God and they will be my children .
66021008	But the cowardly , the unbelieving , the vile , the murderers , the sexually immoral , those who practice magic arts , the idolaters and all liars — they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur . This is the second death . "
66021009	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me , " Come , I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb . "
66021010	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high , and showed me the Holy City , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God .
66021011	It shone with the glory of God , and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel , like a jasper , clear as crystal .
66021012	It had a great , high wall with twelve gates , and with twelve angels at the gates . On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel .
66021013	There were three gates on the east , three on the north , three on the south and three on the west .
66021014	The wall of the city had twelve foundations , and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
66021015	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city , its gates and its walls .
66021016	The city was laid out like a square , as long as it was wide . He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length , and as wide and high as it is long .
66021017	The angel measured the wall using human measurement , and it was 144 cubits thick .
66021018	The wall was made of jasper , and the city of pure gold , as pure as glass .
66021019	The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone . The first foundation was jasper , the second sapphire , the third agate , the fourth emerald ,
66021020	the fifth onyx , the sixth ruby , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth turquoise , the eleventh jacinth , and the twelfth amethyst .
66021021	The twelve gates were twelve pearls , each gate made of a single pearl . The great street of the city was of gold , as pure as transparent glass .
66021022	I did not see a temple in the city , because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple .
66021023	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it , for the glory of God gives it light , and the Lamb is its lamp .
66021024	The nations will walk by its light , and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it .
66021025	On no day will its gates ever be shut , for there will be no night there .
66021026	The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it .
66021027	Nothing impure will ever enter it , nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful , but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life .
66022001	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life , as clear as crystal , flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66022002	down the middle of the great street of the city . On each side of the river stood the tree of life , bearing twelve crops of fruit , yielding its fruit every month . And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations .
66022003	No longer will there be any curse . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city , and his servants will serve him .
66022004	They will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads .
66022005	There will be no more night . They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , for the Lord God will give them light . And they will reign for ever and ever .
66022006	The angel said to me , " These words are trustworthy and true . The Lord , the God who inspires the prophets , sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place . "
66022007	" Look , I am coming soon ! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll . "
66022008	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . And when I had heard and seen them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me .
66022009	But he said to me , " Don't do that ! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll . Worship God ! "
66022010	Then he told me , " Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll , because the time is near .
66022011	Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong ; let the vile person continue to be vile ; let the one who does right continue to do right ; and let the holy person continue to be holy . "
66022012	" Look , I am coming soon ! My reward is with me , and I will give to each person according to what they have done .
66022013	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End .
66022014	" Blessed are those who wash their robes , that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city .
66022015	Outside are the dogs , those who practice magic arts , the sexually immoral , the murderers , the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood .
66022016	" I , Jesus , have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches . I am the Root and the Offspring of David , and the bright Morning Star . "
66022017	The Spirit and the bride say , " Come ! " And let the one who hears say , " Come ! " Let the one who is thirsty come ; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life .
66022018	I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll : If anyone adds anything to them , God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll .
66022019	And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy , God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City , which are described in this scroll .
66022020	He who testifies to these things says , " Yes , I am coming soon . " Amen . Come , Lord Jesus .
66022021	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people . Amen .
